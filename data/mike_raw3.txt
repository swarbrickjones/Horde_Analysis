5 Aug 2014 20:46 - Sam Roberts: Anyone watching the debate? I need to educate myself!
5 Aug 2014 20:51 - Tegan: Can you record it? Does that still happen?
5 Aug 2014 20:51 - Angela: What debate is this?
5 Aug 2014 20:52 - Tegan: Or could iplayer it later in the week?  Would be happy to join you to yaahboo at Alex Salmond
5 Aug 2014 20:52 - Dave: The summary is that salmond will say lots of optimistic things and darling will say lots of pessimistic things (despite his name).
5 Aug 2014 20:52 - Dave: It will be unclear who is right
5 Aug 2014 20:53 - Dave: End result will depend on whether you are optimistic or not
6 Aug 2014 12:35 - Sam Roberts: Good debate, felt a lot more like opinions backed by facts, and less like rabble rousing rhetoric than I was expecting
6 Aug 2014 12:35 - Sam Roberts: Just saw this a week, guess who made their own outfit from a bin bag

8 Aug 2014 10:24 - Alex Bunn: Lol
8 Aug 2014 10:42 - Tegan: Yaaaay!
8 Aug 2014 10:43 - Angela: He's dead now.
8 Aug 2014 10:48 - Shaggy: Because you ate him?
8 Aug 2014 11:00 - Angela: Yeah, poor little guy didn't stand a chance
8 Aug 2014 11:00 - Angela: Far too tasty looking
8 Aug 2014 11:18 - Alex Bunn: Thats what gets for being sad/happy on a friday
8 Aug 2014 11:33 - Krizia: Hahahaha happyyy üéäüéäÓåíÓåí Friday!!!
8 Aug 2014 11:33 - Krizia: I don't want to get eaten ;)
8 Aug 2014 14:45 - Shaggy: Someone died from e cigarette exploding, they are bound to make them illegal now
8 Aug 2014 14:46 - Henry Dranks: laaame I love my ecig
8 Aug 2014 14:46 - Tegan: A few people have set on fire already
8 Aug 2014 14:47 - Tegan: I imagine it will be hard to stop people ordering them from China,  which is where they all seem to come from anyway
8 Aug 2014 14:47 - Henry Dranks: tbh mine gets really sodding hot im not surprised theyre combusting
8 Aug 2014 14:48 - Angela: Technically he was killed by his oxygen tank exploding
8 Aug 2014 14:48 - Angela: Set off by the eecigarette
8 Aug 2014 14:48 - Tegan: Was he under water?
8 Aug 2014 14:48 - Angela: So you're probably ok unless you're carting one of those around, in which case you're not that ok to begin with
8 Aug 2014 14:48 - Shaggy: That's circumstantial, e cigarettes are the real #terrorists here
8 Aug 2014 14:49 - Angela: I'm guessing he had some kind of smoking related illness - how ironic
8 Aug 2014 14:50 - Shaggy: To have lung cancer and die from explosion?
8 Aug 2014 14:50 - Shaggy: At least he can laugh in the face of cancer
8 Aug 2014 14:51 - Henry Dranks: id rather die explosively than cancerously tbh
8 Aug 2014 14:51 - Shaggy: That's ambiguous. Explosive diarrhoea is not a nice way to go
8 Aug 2014 14:53 - Henry Dranks: depends just how explosive surely. I mean, if your digestive system straight up vaporises you it wouldnt be too bad
8 Aug 2014 14:53 - Angela: It'd be bad for whoever finds you
8 Aug 2014 14:54 - Angela: Vaporised by poo
8 Aug 2014 15:16 - Tegan: Ye gods
8 Aug 2014 15:16 - Tegan: Is it possible?
8 Aug 2014 15:46 - Shaggy: Yup, lookup pooverization
8 Aug 2014 15:47 - Shaggy: In fact this is where the word poverty is desired from, literally meaning bathing in own shit
8 Aug 2014 15:49 - Henry Dranks: haha pooverisation love it
8 Aug 2014 15:49 - Henry Dranks: not to be confused with hooverisation, wherein the victim is slowly pulled inside a dyson
8 Aug 2014 15:55 - Shaggy: If anyone is interested in etymology, the term was invented by dyson on Hoover dam, and has nothing to do with hoovers, which are not powerful enough for that particular form of homicide
8 Aug 2014 15:55 - Tegan: Or shoeverisation, where the victim is beaten to death with his own shoes...
8 Aug 2014 15:55 - Tegan: Good Fridaying, everyone x
8 Aug 2014 16:02 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: Lol
8 Aug 2014 16:02 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: Poo

19 Aug 2014 16:25 - Bongo: I'm hoping he's used to people not being able to keep a straight face while talking to him
19 Aug 2014 16:36 - Tegan: Why indeed?
19 Aug 2014 16:36 - Tegan: Tee hee hee

19 Aug 2014 17:49 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: First name Wing
19 Aug 2014 17:59 - Sam Roberts: My sister had a school friend called Richard Dicks. I guess his parents were just bad people
19 Aug 2014 18:03 - Lorna: Two mathematicians I know: dong Wang and jumbo wang
19 Aug 2014 18:05 - Lorna: There should be a support group for people whose names mean penis
19 Aug 2014 18:07 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: You can't not succeed in life with a name like Jumbo Wang
19 Aug 2014 18:08 - Hannah Murphy: A lot of pressure on you in the bedroom I would expect
19 Aug 2014 18:08 - Hannah Murphy: Stressful
19 Aug 2014 18:09 - Sam Roberts: It's a big name to live up to
19 Aug 2014 18:23 - Alex Bunn: Now thats a name i couldnt restrain myself from laughing at

19 Aug 2014 19:08 - Angela: Thai has a letter in between d and t, which is used for tom yum soup. So it's a bit different
19 Aug 2014 19:32 - Owen: I teach a kid called dong hung. I bet he doesn't get picked on because he can always use the "dong hung by name dong hung by nature" comeback.

20 Aug 2014 16:33 - Phil: Does the ladies triathlon include mud wrestling instead of biking?
20 Aug 2014 16:44 - Tegan: Is that distance mud wrestling?
20 Aug 2014 16:56 - Sam Roberts: With a strict 2 items or less policy on clothing
20 Aug 2014 16:58 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: I would choose kigu
20 Aug 2014 16:58 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: And another kigu to go on top of that kigu

20 Aug 2014 17:00 - Sam Roberts: But that's why you'll never win the Seattle women's triathlon
20 Aug 2014 17:01 - Tegan: You could sell that kigu, no question
20 Aug 2014 17:01 - Tegan: Maybe big data ain't your game

1 Sep 2014 18:49 - Shaggy: If you like turkish cuisine I strongly recommend tas, it's pretty cheap and mighty tasty. If you want tapas then brindisa is really good, it's moderately priced. If you want a more pub-like atmosphere the George has excellent chefs too
1 Sep 2014 19:41 - Lora: Brindisa is expensive and always too crowded, long wait. I always love me a good vapiano!
1 Sep 2014 22:58 - Bongo: I thought you said it was Friday henners, or is that something else

5 Sep 2014 20:39 - Dan Sluckin: That's what SHE said.
5 Sep 2014 20:40 - Owen: I believe bongo was relaying the information that a fine gangsta named shorty is able to fire a shot gun proficiently but only if he is in less affluent neighbourhoods.
5 Sep 2014 20:41 - Dan Sluckin: (After the 'incident')
5 Sep 2014 20:50 - Tegan: Thank you Owen

5 Sep 2014 20:57 - Krizia: <Media omitted>
5 Sep 2014 21:25 - Owen: I am a slow loris
I live in a forest
Eating bugs makes my day
Detroit what'd ya say?
5 Sep 2014 21:26 - Owen: I pull out my gat
And with a ratatat tat
Five slugs in your belly
Makes tupac jelly.
5 Sep 2014 21:29 - Owen: When I left compton town
The crime rate went down
Like sam's mom on peter kay
Thats g life; O-K?
5 Sep 2014 21:30 - Shaggy: Not bad
5 Sep 2014 21:31 - Shaggy: For a five year old dive dwelling chive favouring slum child
5 Sep 2014 21:32 - Tegan: Lol

5 Sep 2014 21:32 - Tegan: Nice rhymes, o
5 Sep 2014 21:33 - Tegan: Where did V go?
5 Sep 2014 21:37 - Owen: Let's have a word for Mike swarbrick.
He wears the badge of a law dick.
Takes names: 'your nicked'
His mom takes the dicks of four tricks!
5 Sep 2014 21:38 - Tegan: Niiiiiice intro
5 Sep 2014 21:48 - Owen: Whatup tegan palmer
Voice like a farmer.
Herder of llama.
Wearer of armour.

Yeah I know, that's not so good.
But it ain't bad for a guy from the hood.
I'll stop and continue you should.
While I pause and eat my pud.
5 Sep 2014 21:52 - Dan Sluckin: O, your rhymes are so reckless,
We'll show you up as a ludicrous,
feckless, slow loris.
Less ability than Boris...
Johnson at rapping,
caught you napping, prattling
about other's mothers,
but yours ain't getting no thinner,
Time to shut up and eat your dinner.
5 Sep 2014 21:53 - Shaggy: I like your rhymes but they're not quite mature, think for a bit and then when you're sure hit back, with rhyme that ain't whack, rhyme that will make me take smack, rhyme that will me take crack, crack my back, whack the smack and all that, sure
5 Sep 2014 21:53 - Owen: Reckless and ludicrous rhyme in no way at all.

Other than that.  It was pretty good.
5 Sep 2014 21:55 - Shaggy: Dan your rhymes rule, you've studied the school of cool, they literally make drool. You ain't no fool! Like poor O
5 Sep 2014 22:04 - Dan Sluckin: I don't need no rhyming dictionary using critic,
The links and perfect timing, work when I just hit it.
If you read the flow like my man Shaggage
You'll find no space for baggage:
Ludicrous, said like the rapper, entrepreneur and actor
rhymes with reckless and is a determining factor,
In your freestyling downfall,
Your mind is so small,
I await your next reply, so
Alex Trofymenko,
Can just show
How its done yo.
5 Sep 2014 22:04 - Dan Sluckin: Or alternatively teegz
Because I just want to play leagues...
5 Sep 2014 22:14 - Owen: Ok I guess I have to play leagues now. That was excellent.
5 Sep 2014 22:15 - Shaggy added Adimina

12 Sep 2014 12:57 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: TIL: George Foreman has 5 sons called George, George, George, George and George
12 Sep 2014 12:57 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: And a daughter called Georgetta
12 Sep 2014 13:00 - Sam Roberts: That's nuts
12 Sep 2014 13:00 - Sam Roberts: And a great Wikipedia read
12 Sep 2014 13:01 - Joe Jarman: Must get confusing at Christmas
12 Sep 2014 13:01 - Joe Jarman: Do they have nicknames
12 Sep 2014 13:01 - Joe Jarman: I bet he just gets them all an updated version of his grill anyway
12 Sep 2014 13:09 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: Lol
12 Sep 2014 13:11 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: I like that he turned down Georgia, Georgie, Georgina for Georgetta!

12 Sep 2014 13:13 - Tegan: Roman numerals are always a stately option

12 Sep 2014 13:34 - Angela: Maybe he's just passing on his greatest legacy. The name of an amazing piece of kitchenware. Being called george Forman must open a lot of doors in life
12 Sep 2014 13:35 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: His sons should change the name to George Fiveman
12 Sep 2014 13:43 - Sam Roberts: Would you rather fight one George Fiveman sized George Foreman, or four George Foreman sized George Fivemans?

12 Sep 2014 14:32 - Joe Jarman: Does grandmaster flash have to be a page they've liked?
12 Sep 2014 14:33 - Hannah Murphy: Nah it's just started making any old suggestions closest to what you're writing
12 Sep 2014 14:33 - Hannah Murphy: Or perhaps old nana's just love the flashster

13 Sep 2014 19:22 - Tegan: Thanks for all the hard work, guys :)
13 Sep 2014 19:24 - Tegan: Wellcome is sweet, the exhibition is small, but the permanent exhibition is also worth a look
13 Sep 2014 19:24 - Tegan: In the vacinity of the cider tap aswell, which is a home away from home for a West Country man
13 Sep 2014 19:50 - Sam Roberts: Cider specific? The Roberts clan has never been too apple-centric
13 Sep 2014 19:50 - Sam Roberts: Top tip though, cheers
13 Sep 2014 19:51 - Dave: It's all cider but it has a beery brother over the road
13 Sep 2014 19:54 - Sam Roberts: Sounds like a winning recipe for a powerful hangover, can't wait
13 Sep 2014 19:58 - Tegan: The beer version is the Euston tap- it's much busier, with much more liklihood of having to stand on the pavement
13 Sep 2014 20:15 - Tegan: <Media omitted>
13 Sep 2014 20:15 - Tegan: Eric Cantona. 1987
13 Sep 2014 21:46 - Angela: Rocking a Burberry hat too, years ahead of the curve
13 Sep 2014 21:47 - Tegan: Looking every inch the hero
14 Sep 2014 05:56 - Adimina: <Media omitted>
14 Sep 2014 05:57 - Adimina: Fischmarkt
14 Sep 2014 10:01 - Vanessa: Sorry guys brunch is postponed today
14 Sep 2014 10:33 - Bongo: Lol that looks tasty
14 Sep 2014 10:47 - Adimina: At 6:30 it was amazeballs
14 Sep 2014 10:57 - Tegan: Mmmmm
14 Sep 2014 10:58 - Tegan: Shall we do something else instead of brunch?
14 Sep 2014 11:01 - Joe Jarman: Fry up
14 Sep 2014 14:09 - Tegan: The time for fry ups may have passed
14 Sep 2014 14:09 - Tegan: But if anyone fancies coming round for a beer and a board game you'd be more than welcome
14 Sep 2014 14:32 - Tegan: Or out for a roast later?
14 Sep 2014 14:32 - Tegan: Options
14 Sep 2014 14:34 - Joe Jarman: Flint knapping in stoke Newington is an option
14 Sep 2014 14:52 - Lorna: I was going to head to the old blue last later on, for some jazzy live music. Its free, and round the corner (from me at least)
14 Sep 2014 14:57 - Tegan: Both sound intriguing
14 Sep 2014 14:57 - Tegan: Will you be stripping out the copper as well, Joe?
14 Sep 2014 16:54 - Tegan: (Have since looked up what flint knapping is- looks like fun)
14 Sep 2014 18:24 - Joe Jarman: I know I'm gutted I didn't attend
15 Sep 2014 15:48 - Alex Bunn: <Media omitted>
15 Sep 2014 15:49 - Alex Bunn: <Media omitted>
15 Sep 2014 16:32 - Tegan: Where's the second one from?
15 Sep 2014 16:35 - Alex Bunn: Google extrafabulouscomics
15 Sep 2014 16:52 - Adimina: Yo c town. I'm back from Hamburg today to take Phil's bed. Who is home when?
15 Sep 2014 16:53 - Sam Roberts: Wooo! I'll be around about 6.30, we were just discussing making a pie, in?
15 Sep 2014 16:55 - Alex Bunn: Yeah back around 6.30ish
15 Sep 2014 16:55 - Alex Bunn: Bring wine
15 Sep 2014 16:55 - Adimina: It's meat-free Monday so if it's a veggie pie then yes
15 Sep 2014 16:56 - Adimina: I got y'all a postcard. Here's a sneak peek
15 Sep 2014 16:56 - Alex Bunn: Afraid it has several types of meat
15 Sep 2014 16:57 - Adimina: <Media omitted>
15 Sep 2014 16:57 - Sam Roberts: That's a man
15 Sep 2014 16:57 - Adimina: Hehehe
15 Sep 2014 16:58 - Alex Bunn: Manish ankles
15 Sep 2014 16:58 - Alex Bunn: Mankles
15 Sep 2014 16:58 - Adimina: I'll getting some set duty free booze
15 Sep 2014 16:58 - Adimina: *sweet
15 Sep 2014 17:08 - Adimina: And by "boarding soon" I mean "my plane is on another city and delayed an hour"
15 Sep 2014 20:55 - Adimina: ÓÄùÓÄéÓÑº
15 Sep 2014 21:20 - Alex Bunn: Have you got to London yet?
15 Sep 2014 21:20 - Adimina: On the train to blackfriars now
15 Sep 2014 22:43 - Adimina: Coming from star lane now. Get the shot glasses ready boys. Tuesday boozeday
16 Sep 2014 13:28 - Tegan: Anyone want to come try out the climbing wall at mile end this evening?
16 Sep 2014 13:29 - Sam Roberts: Hmm could do, they've got a great overhang room there
16 Sep 2014 13:29 - Sam Roberts: I think it gets busier though, let me see if dreas is up for it
16 Sep 2014 13:31 - Adimina: What time ya thinking?
16 Sep 2014 13:31 - Tegan: 7ish?
16 Sep 2014 13:32 - Adimina: Ah, gotta be in North London for 8 so I'll pass. But keen for a cling sometime
16 Sep 2014 17:27 - Sam Roberts: Going to the usual place just now, if you fancy a Bermondsey climb I'll be there in 30 mins or so
16 Sep 2014 19:18 - Adimina: Do I got a bit excited and tie dyed a dress... So of anyone needs to dye anything green our blue there is some outside... I'll be back later tonight to dispose of it if not
16 Sep 2014 20:17 - Sam Roberts: Let's tie dye all Bunns pants, he loves hippy stuff like that
16 Sep 2014 20:18 - Adimina: Or his work shirts?
16 Sep 2014 20:18 - Sam Roberts: Even better! He's in the green division, guaranteed promotion
16 Sep 2014 20:27 - Dave: Don't forget his hats...he hates that they're not all green
16 Sep 2014 20:32 - Adimina: Oh, and his undies
16 Sep 2014 20:33 - Dave: You always have to turn a serious conversation into something silly don't you...
16 Sep 2014 20:36 - Adimina: I am dead serious. If Bunn doesn't have all green undies then he's not a real man
16 Sep 2014 20:37 - Dave: Well as long as you're serious! Shame you don't have yellow dye, could get a teenage mutant teenage turtle theme going
16 Sep 2014 20:38 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: Wait, do you mean this?
16 Sep 2014 20:38 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: <Media omitted>

17 Sep 2014 13:51 - Krizia: ÓÑÖ
17 Sep 2014 13:52 - Sam Roberts: I've been lied to! The color run started as a holi thing, but this one isn't on holi which is always in spring
17 Sep 2014 13:52 - Sam Roberts: Good comparative religion Bunn
17 Sep 2014 13:53 - Alex Bunn: I remember holi was just after we left india in feb

17 Sep 2014 15:47 - Bongo: Also up for the colour run
17 Sep 2014 15:48 - Krizia: She is gorgeous!!! to not say one of the most beautiful people I know! !
17 Sep 2014 15:49 - Krizia: She is a musical actress so super fun to be around
17 Sep 2014 15:50 - Owen: Well I don't know  about anyone else but that was a  good sell. I'm in. Let  us all gaze upon this beauty.
17 Sep 2014 15:58 - Krizia: Hehe he well I'm just saying we should do something fun :)
17 Sep 2014 16:08 - Adimina: ÓÄé

17 Sep 2014 18:50 - Alex Bunn: Aight
17 Sep 2014 18:50 - Alex Bunn: How long?
17 Sep 2014 18:58 - Bongo: Not sure, I'm on fleet str
17 Sep 2014 18:58 - Bongo: I might have to take a bus
17 Sep 2014 19:01 - Alex Bunn: Hmm
17 Sep 2014 19:01 - Alex Bunn: Might bail then
17 Sep 2014 19:01 - Alex Bunn: Only wanted a quick one
17 Sep 2014 19:02 - Tegan: Won't be long
17 Sep 2014 19:02 - Tegan: I've had enough of this
17 Sep 2014 19:05 - Bongo: Eta tegs?
17 Sep 2014 19:05 - Bongo: Google says I'll be 15 mins
17 Sep 2014 19:08 - Alex Bunn: Bleh üò©üò§
17 Sep 2014 19:10 - Bongo: Go home then part timer =P
17 Sep 2014 19:11 - Alex Bunn: This guy was bored and finished at 6
17 Sep 2014 19:13 - Bongo: Lol I won't blame you if you leave, I'd rather be water boarded than bored
17 Sep 2014 19:15 - Tegan: 13 minute walk from here
17 Sep 2014 19:26 - Bongo: Just got here if anyone's around
17 Sep 2014 19:27 - Bongo: The pints are on me
17 Sep 2014 19:27 - Bongo: Just like an alcoholic milkybar kid
17 Sep 2014 19:32 - Tegan: I'm outside Bong- let's enjoy this mild evening
17 Sep 2014 19:48 - Alex Bunn: Yeah i went home
17 Sep 2014 19:56 - Sam Roberts: Just tubing from Euston, the anchor still aye?
17 Sep 2014 20:21 - Bongo: Aye
17 Sep 2014 22:27 - Tegan: Owen owen owen, what was the pretty building game for phones you talked about, with the building interaction and such?
17 Sep 2014 22:38 - Owen: ?
17 Sep 2014 22:39 - Tegan: I need a game
17 Sep 2014 22:39 - Tegan: You mentioned you were playing one
17 Sep 2014 22:39 - Tegan: A building game
17 Sep 2014 22:40 - Tegan: Where rabbits interact work blueberries and the like
17 Sep 2014 22:40 - Owen: Terrestial?
17 Sep 2014 22:40 - Owen: Ohhhh
17 Sep 2014 22:40 - Owen: That's not a phone game
17 Sep 2014 22:40 - Owen: Reus.
17 Sep 2014 22:40 - Tegan: Bum
17 Sep 2014 22:40 - Owen: It's really good.
17 Sep 2014 22:40 - Tegan: I only need a phone game
17 Sep 2014 22:41 - Owen: I am learning android to make a phone game with similar ideas.
17 Sep 2014 22:41 - Owen: What kind of phone game?
17 Sep 2014 22:43 - Tegan: A building game
17 Sep 2014 22:43 - Tegan: With pretty
17 Sep 2014 22:43 - Tegan: All crowd sourced suggestions welcome
17 Sep 2014 22:47 - Sam Roberts: Terraria. Best game ever
17 Sep 2014 23:09 - Owen: There aren't  many good phone  building  games.
17 Sep 2014 23:09 - Sam Roberts: Ooh xconstructor
17 Sep 2014 23:10 - Owen: Tiny tower was pretty addictive but it was one of those stupid wait  4 hours for something to  finish.
17 Sep 2014 23:10 - Sam Roberts: Not sure if it's on iPhone, but it's awesome
17 Sep 2014 23:10 - Owen: X constructor?
17 Sep 2014 23:10 - Owen: That sounds good. What is it?
17 Sep 2014 23:10 - Sam Roberts: I think that's it, where you build railway bridges and trains go over them
17 Sep 2014 23:11 - Sam Roberts: But if you build them badly, everyone dies
17 Sep 2014 23:18 - Owen: Nice
17 Sep 2014 23:34 - Joe Jarman: Hey Owen how good with android are you
17 Sep 2014 23:34 - Joe Jarman: I'm starting a coursesa course in a few days
17 Sep 2014 23:35 - Joe Jarman: Looking for others interested
17 Sep 2014 23:35 - Joe Jarman: Also I've been messing about with unity as well
18 Sep 2014 00:24 - Owen: I'm about 1/4 of the way through my book. I have got the basics and am now using fragments. It's a pretty neat setup. Very scalable, but that means that you have to do quite a lot for even the simplest app. Fortunately android released a development  kit pre bundled with eclipse which takes away loads of the legwork  that existed when android was first  released. I haven't  looked into unity, mainly because I don't have an apple. What's  it like?
18 Sep 2014 09:01 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: What's the predictions for Scotland vote then?
18 Sep 2014 09:01 - Angela: I think it'll be a no, what do you think?
18 Sep 2014 09:02 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: I reckon no too, morbidly curious to see a yes vote though...
18 Sep 2014 09:02 - Angela: I didn't think I was bothered but actually I would be a bit sad if they voted yes
18 Sep 2014 09:03 - Angela: Like being dumped by someone I completely took for granted all these years
18 Sep 2014 09:03 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: Lol
18 Sep 2014 09:03 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: And all those cyclists. Damn
18 Sep 2014 09:04 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: 55% no, that's my bet
18 Sep 2014 09:05 - Sam Roberts: Cyclists?
18 Sep 2014 09:06 - Martha: Reckon 52% no - a bit too close for comfort
18 Sep 2014 09:06 - Sam Roberts: I'm not sure I care about the really. The important thing is it sets the stage for Cornish independence, which is way overdue
18 Sep 2014 09:07 - Sam Roberts: *result
18 Sep 2014 09:07 - Sam Roberts: They actually have their own currency, take that Scotland
18 Sep 2014 09:08 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: Yeah think about all those gold medals we got in the cycling!
18 Sep 2014 09:08 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: I reckon no's are underreporting. I'd be surprised by a yes vote
18 Sep 2014 09:13 - Angela: I agree, I think 55% at least for no
18 Sep 2014 09:18 - Dave: I think I would be happy either way: excited for an independent Scotland, content to see an island united.
18 Sep 2014 09:20 - Dave: The underreporting point is true though the polls may not be very reliable. There was a chap from yougov on the radio the other day saying that polls are usually weighted to control for the way they are sampled however this process requires historical data
18 Sep 2014 09:20 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: There's no exit polls! Bullshit, where's the fun in that?
18 Sep 2014 09:20 - Dave: There isn't any such data for this referendum but the weighting process has been done anyway which can skew the results
18 Sep 2014 09:24 - Joe Jarman: Ungrateful Scots costing us a fortune yes or no, best just to cull the lot of em. Off to collect my dole money ÓêÖ
18 Sep 2014 09:25 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: You know betfair have already paid out on no? Thats pretty cocky...
18 Sep 2014 09:26 - Angela: While they weight the results for sampling, they can't weight them for people lying. All the polls in 1992 predicted a labour win but it turned out that voting conservative was so uncool that people just didn't want to admit to it
18 Sep 2014 09:26 - Dave: What happens if it's yes? Do they have to return the money?
18 Sep 2014 09:27 - Angela: Probably voting no is seen as boring but actually people do want the safer option?
18 Sep 2014 09:28 - Alex Bunn: I'm for a yes vote
18 Sep 2014 09:28 - Dave: Maybe, bit I wonder how many people, when in the ballot box, will let the excitement take over and change to yes
18 Sep 2014 09:28 - Alex Bunn: I bet they could have a more progressive country if they cut London loose
18 Sep 2014 09:31 - Alex Bunn: Great Britain is renamed, not-so-great-anymore Britain
18 Sep 2014 09:32 - Krizia: I think the contrary actually happens in the ballot box a lot of people take the safe option or they change right there!
18 Sep 2014 09:32 - Alex Bunn: Not-as-united as before Kindom
18 Sep 2014 09:33 - Krizia: I can't wait for this to be over! !! its boring at work all is Scott here there! ! Common
18 Sep 2014 09:43 - Sam Roberts: They'll all be deported tomorrow, it'll be a lonely Friday for you!
18 Sep 2014 09:49 - Krizia: Hehe well if I had a vote I would say yes!!! Let's start a revolution just for the sake of it!!
18 Sep 2014 09:54 - Alex Bunn: Thats the spirit!
18 Sep 2014 09:56 - Dave: Yay!
18 Sep 2014 09:57 - Adimina: If the Scots leave then soon enough we'll have Wales and the rest of Ireland jumping ship too
18 Sep 2014 09:57 - Adimina: Then well just be "Britain"
18 Sep 2014 09:57 - Alex Bunn: Wales and Ireland dont have any oil
18 Sep 2014 09:59 - Alex Bunn: But i would quite like to see Wales go it alone
18 Sep 2014 09:59 - Alex Bunn: They could export loveliness
18 Sep 2014 10:05 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: Let's have a London referendum! Fuck everyone else!
18 Sep 2014 10:05 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: Except Hatfield
18 Sep 2014 10:07 - Owen: I hope it is a yes. That would be an awesome experiment.
18 Sep 2014 10:08 - Owen: One that we can observe but that really doesn't  affect us much.
18 Sep 2014 10:08 - Sam Roberts: Whisky prices will go up
18 Sep 2014 10:08 - Sam Roberts: It's the only effect on my life I can think of
18 Sep 2014 10:10 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: Gold medals in cycling will plummet
18 Sep 2014 10:11 - Vanessa: England is starting to produce some good whiskey
18 Sep 2014 10:11 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: People keep ignoring the big issues
18 Sep 2014 10:11 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: Do we still get to claim someone from the uk won Wimbledon?
18 Sep 2014 10:12 - Owen: Will they? That depends on  a lot of factors: Import  and export tax between England and Scotland, whether the new scoring government  decides to subsidise whiskey, EU trade rules.
18 Sep 2014 10:14 - Sam Roberts: It won't go down
18 Sep 2014 10:14 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: It also depends on whether we decide to put Hadrian's wall back up
18 Sep 2014 10:14 - Sam Roberts: We're only losing Hoy, and without the superior british bikes and training, he'll dwindle to a hollowed has been
18 Sep 2014 10:21 - Alex Bunn: He'll dwindle to a hollowed has been anyway
18 Sep 2014 10:21 - Alex Bunn: Ha!
18 Sep 2014 10:21 - Alex Bunn: Ageing
18 Sep 2014 10:22 - Alex Bunn: I think claiming Andy Murray as our own has been a gigantic push for Scottish independence
18 Sep 2014 10:24 - Owen: It could go down sam. It is a big industry. Wouldn't be suprised if a Scotland in charge of thier own economy decide to subsidise it loads. That coupled with EU trade laws would mean no export tax to Britain.
18 Sep 2014 10:24 - Owen: France subsidise thier wine industry considerably.

24 Sep 2014 18:15 - Adimina: I just got this message now that I'm home... I think I'll go kickboxing instead. Btw I found a fourth team member for colour run
24 Sep 2014 19:13 - Dave: Is everyone still out?
24 Sep 2014 19:13 - Dave: I just finished a 4.5 hour interview and need a drink.

24 Sep 2014 21:44 - Sam Roberts: Trees!
24 Sep 2014 21:45 - Sam Roberts: Yees!

25 Sep 2014 06:45 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: <Media omitted>
25 Sep 2014 10:18 - Adimina: Hey c-towners. Where is this cheap racist hairdresser I can go to for a short back and sides
25 Sep 2014 10:19 - Shaggy: I think you should grow a mullet
25 Sep 2014 10:23 - Adimina: That is an option...
25 Sep 2014 10:48 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: Peter's. He may also be sexist in which case you'll have to pretend to be a guy
25 Sep 2014 10:50 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: He's really crap btw, I just go there out of habit now
25 Sep 2014 10:54 - Adimina: Haha... I do look a bit like a boy
25 Sep 2014 10:54 - Adimina: How can you mess up short back and sides though?
25 Sep 2014 10:56 - Owen: By doing long back and sides instead.
25 Sep 2014 10:56 - Owen: Like a monk.
25 Sep 2014 11:00 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: One time he forgot to cut one of the sides, and I had to remind him
25 Sep 2014 11:03 - Adimina: Hahaha
25 Sep 2014 11:03 - Tegan: Lol
25 Sep 2014 11:27 - Owen: A kid just dislocated his knee. On my break duty!
25 Sep 2014 11:38 - Vanessa: Just pop it in place
25 Sep 2014 11:38 - Owen: Instructions unclear. Now he has two dislocated knees.
25 Sep 2014 11:39 - Vanessa: Now you can call for an ambulance
25 Sep 2014 11:40 - Owen: Instructions unclear. Now he has an ambulance stuck under his kneecap.
25 Sep 2014 11:45 - Shaggy: Get off your phone and help the damn kid
25 Sep 2014 11:45 - Owen: Instructions unclear. Now my phone is duct taped to his forehead!
25 Sep 2014 12:43 - Bongo: Skirt size linked to breast cancer?!
25 Sep 2014 12:44 - Bongo: I've seriously had enough of bbc news
25 Sep 2014 12:48 - Owen: Wait shorter or longer?
25 Sep 2014 12:49 - Owen: Shorter skirt size linked to breast cancer - Christian union says.

Long skirt size linked to breast cancer - playboy magazine says.
25 Sep 2014 12:49 - Owen: One might begin to question thier motivations.
25 Sep 2014 12:50 - Tegan: Ha
25 Sep 2014 12:50 - Owen: Also if it's long skirts that cause breast cancer does that mean we can stop victim blaming when a woman in a short skirt gets raped because she was just trying to protect herself from cancer.
25 Sep 2014 12:51 - Tegan: I think they mean skirt size causes cancer.
25 Sep 2014 12:54 - Owen: It's like the people who do these studies have never heard of comorbidity.
25 Sep 2014 12:55 - Angela: So if I wear jeans? No cancer?
25 Sep 2014 12:55 - Tegan: Solved!
25 Sep 2014 12:55 - Angela: Wait... Jean skirts though
25 Sep 2014 12:55 - Angela: No jean skirts
25 Sep 2014 12:56 - Dave: Which way round is the correlation? Should I wear skirts?
25 Sep 2014 12:57 - Tegan: Perhaps you should do a pamphlet
25 Sep 2014 12:57 - Tegan: But not wearing skirts doesn't stop you have a skirt size
25 Sep 2014 12:57 - Tegan: So yes dave
25 Sep 2014 12:57 - Tegan: You should
25 Sep 2014 12:57 - Joe Jarman: Why isn't it bum size linked to breast cancer
25 Sep 2014 12:58 - Owen: The skirt doesn't even cover the breasts!  How the hell would it cause them to get cancer!
25 Sep 2014 12:58 - Joe Jarman: Although I imagine there is some seriously positive correlation with bum size and boob size
25 Sep 2014 13:00 - Bongo: I reckon we should all just go naked from the waist down to avoid looking stupid
25 Sep 2014 13:02 - Joe Jarman: Naaaah waist up, nobody wants to see that bongo, put it away!
25 Sep 2014 13:04 - Owen: Wait. So a size 8 is less likely to get cancer than a size 14. Why don't they just say people who are larger are generally less healthy. The skirt thing is irrelevant!!!
25 Sep 2014 13:09 - Vanessa: I'm not sure where they got the correlation of waist size for breast cancer. But there is a definite relation between waist size and heart disease, which is not a cancer
25 Sep 2014 13:09 - Vanessa: I just read the article and it's pretty poorly written
25 Sep 2014 13:48 - Alex Bunn: Pints in the george tonight?
25 Sep 2014 13:56 - Dave: Doig! Not sure. What's the occasion?
25 Sep 2014 14:13 - Shaggy: Going to that gig in angel tonight
25 Sep 2014 14:23 - Alex Bunn: Thursday is the occassion
25 Sep 2014 15:02 - Tegan: Can't celebrate Thursday this week
25 Sep 2014 15:02 - Tegan: Enjoy it though!
25 Sep 2014 16:10 - Shaggy: Who's going to metalworks? Drinks/food beforehand?
25 Sep 2014 16:55 - Vanessa: Me
25 Sep 2014 17:04 - Sam Roberts: I am! Got me n Addy on the app yesterday
25 Sep 2014 17:06 - Vanessa: Did you receive an email?
25 Sep 2014 17:12 - Shaggy: Just because you applied doesn't mean you have the tickets
25 Sep 2014 17:52 - Sam Roberts: Pretty sure I got a thing, let me check

25 Sep 2014 18:01 - Shaggy: Don't know if it does pizza but it definitely does beer
25 Sep 2014 18:02 - Sam Roberts: Pubs called the arc, good pizza, but expensive though, there's the spoons if one fancy turns up?
25 Sep 2014 18:02 - Vanessa: I'm making my way so just let me know which one you guys decide
25 Sep 2014 18:13 - Shaggy: I'll be there in 15
25 Sep 2014 18:27 - Shaggy: I'm by the arc, it's called brewhouse now
25 Sep 2014 18:27 - Vanessa: Should be there in about 10
25 Sep 2014 18:28 - Shaggy: Or rather will be, it's being refurbished, so spoons it is
25 Sep 2014 18:31 - Sam Roberts: 'Mazing, got caught up, be there in 10
25 Sep 2014 18:36 - Vanessa: They have kraken so all is good
25 Sep 2014 18:37 - Sam Roberts: Try and get an outdoors seat, I want to smoke and drink beer
25 Sep 2014 18:37 - Adimina: What time gig starting? Kickboxing note in Camden

25 Sep 2014 19:04 - Sam Roberts: Pen
25 Sep 2014 19:05 - Tegan: Nice one Cate.  Can I just buy a snow monkey through you?

26 Sep 2014 09:01 - Martha: Montage scene. GO CATE!
26 Sep 2014 09:32 - Owen: How much is the bonus? If it is more then 300 the rational choice would be to just buy yourself a monkey (or whatever percentage of a monkey is equal to 300).
26 Sep 2014 10:04 - Z cate fuchter: Haha. The bonus is 10%. Or five monkies (?) Not sure where this cost of monkey estimate has come from Owen!
26 Sep 2014 10:06 - Adimina: üôäÓàÅüôâÓÑïüôàÓîüüòÜ
26 Sep 2014 11:03 - Owen: 10% of everything over the bonus limit? Or 10% of all your sales for the month?
26 Sep 2014 12:11 - Adimina: So I just discovered that since 2011 LOL has been formally recognized in the Oxford dictionary
26 Sep 2014 12:37 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: I like lol
26 Sep 2014 12:37 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: Its the only one of those ones that you can actually say in your head

26 Sep 2014 12:39 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: They all sound naff in your head
26 Sep 2014 12:41 - Dave: Roffle sounds good
26 Sep 2014 12:44 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: Yeah actually roffle can stay
26 Sep 2014 12:50 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: Omguh I just got cherry flavoured Pepsi instead of Pepsi flavoured Pepsi. Fummle.
26 Sep 2014 12:54 - Sam Roberts: I started saying omg like an American schoolgirl to be edgy and ironic, after a week I was just talking like an American schoolgirl
26 Sep 2014 12:57 - Adimina: I'm the same with soz. Out started out ironically, but now I genuinely mean sorry
26 Sep 2014 12:57 - Adimina: I once said soz to a dog I bumped into

28 Sep 2014 16:54 - Sam Roberts: Addy's left us some homemade burgers if you fancy one
28 Sep 2014 16:57 - Tegan: Sorry to miss this momentous occasion
28 Sep 2014 16:57 - Tegan: Needs to be a Sunday of penitence though
28 Sep 2014 16:57 - Sam Roberts: You were in our hearts
28 Sep 2014 16:58 - Sam Roberts: What happened?
28 Sep 2014 16:58 - Tegan: My parents were staying
28 Sep 2014 16:59 - Tegan: Feel like if we can't get through a weekend of moderation with them then I'm pretty much genetically screwed
28 Sep 2014 16:59 - Tegan: And I will always have to have sunday hangovers
29 Sep 2014 08:33 - Sam Roberts: Sorry to do a Hannah guys but...
29 Sep 2014 08:34 - Sam Roberts: <Media omitted>

29 Sep 2014 09:31 - Shaggy: Lol!
29 Sep 2014 09:54 - Alex Bunn: To youtube!
29 Sep 2014 10:28 - Owen: Your like Ron Swanson sam.
29 Sep 2014 10:28 - Owen: You're*
29 Sep 2014 10:49 - Adimina: So it's almost October. Anyone keen to arrange a trip to Thorpe Park Fright Nights
29 Sep 2014 10:51 - Krizia: Sam!!!! He loves the rollercoasters ;)
29 Sep 2014 10:51 - Krizia: And me!! I haven't been in a park for ages!  I always faint though
29 Sep 2014 11:03 - Sam Roberts: I've never been on a roller coaster, feels a little strange to make it to 28 and then pop my cherry
29 Sep 2014 11:06 - Dave: It'll be even stranger of you make it to 29
29 Sep 2014 11:06 - Dave: if
29 Sep 2014 11:08 - Adimina: Haha true. Even numbers are best
29 Sep 2014 12:28 - Alex Bunn: Ive never been on one of those massive ones either
29 Sep 2014 12:29 - Shaggy: That's what she said
29 Sep 2014 12:32 - Alex Bunn: <Media omitted>
29 Sep 2014 12:36 - Owen: Sam. My pension counts as an untaxed allowance correct?
29 Sep 2014 12:37 - Owen: So my taxable income is my income minus my pension.
29 Sep 2014 12:37 - Owen: And minus NI?
29 Sep 2014 12:40 - Owen: Wait. The ¬£10,000 limit before you start having to pay tax counts as an allowance.
29 Sep 2014 12:41 - Owen: ?
29 Sep 2014 12:41 - Owen: Be on lunch break already. I want answers!!
29 Sep 2014 12:44 - Owen: Never mind. I figured it out.
29 Sep 2014 12:45 - Owen: By the way. If you earn less than 41k then tax on dividends is only 10% compared to the 20% on regular savings. If you earn more than that then dividend tax is 32.5%
29 Sep 2014 12:46 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: Banter
29 Sep 2014 12:47 - Owen: Lel
29 Sep 2014 12:47 - Owen: What I just said was wrong anyway.
29 Sep 2014 12:47 - Owen: There is a 10% tax credit.
29 Sep 2014 12:48 - Owen: So if you earn below 41k you pay no tax on dividends.
29 Sep 2014 12:48 - Owen: And 22.5% if you earn more than 41k.
29 Sep 2014 12:48 - Shaggy: Yawn
29 Sep 2014 12:49 - Owen: Fine. Go invest your money somewhere stupid like up your arse!
29 Sep 2014 12:50 - Shaggy: I invest my money into beer, and my fund, read stomach, has swollen enough to show that it's a good choice
29 Sep 2014 12:51 - Tegan: Plus investment in liver cirrhosis at this stage negates the need to think about retirement plans
29 Sep 2014 12:52 - Tegan: Morbid, yet simple
29 Sep 2014 12:53 - Owen: Ok well I'm going to choose companies with a high price to earnings ratio and..... who am I kidding I'll invest in booze as well.
29 Sep 2014 12:54 - Adimina: Woo boozevestment
29 Sep 2014 12:57 - Sam Roberts: Great bant-ccountancy Owen, thanks
29 Sep 2014 12:58 - Sam Roberts: And the 10% credit means you actually get money back for getting dividend income, it's to encourage poor people to invest in the market, which I find weird on a few levels
29 Sep 2014 12:58 - Adimina: In other news. I just watched three episodes of parks and rec back to back
29 Sep 2014 12:59 - Alex Bunn: Get a job
29 Sep 2014 13:00 - Adimina: I have a job. It's called couch tuner
29 Sep 2014 13:01 - Alex Bunn: Haha. Aw man i wish i was watching parks and rec!
29 Sep 2014 13:03 - Adimina: You could be. If you quit. He he he
29 Sep 2014 13:04 - Adimina: True fact: addiction to parks and rec us the heading cause of unemployment
29 Sep 2014 13:05 - Tegan: Neither true, nor a fact. But 'true fact' is a truism.
29 Sep 2014 13:05 - Tegan: So there's that
29 Sep 2014 13:06 - Tegan: Man, I'm in a monday mood. Sigh.
29 Sep 2014 13:06 - Alex Bunn: I just ate a lovely Gulash from EAT
29 Sep 2014 13:07 - Alex Bunn: That helped
29 Sep 2014 13:07 - Tegan: I decided to try itsu again. Bad decision.
29 Sep 2014 13:07 - Tegan: That shit is nasty.
29 Sep 2014 13:10 - Krizia: Hahahaha !   I'm in I won't work again mood, so I'll participate in any sort of conversa!!! it's been a very very slow day :$
29 Sep 2014 13:16 - Lorna: I leave my job tomorrow. So anything I do badly today is someone else's problem. Comforting. And in no way motivating.
29 Sep 2014 13:17 - Krizia: ÓåíÓåíÓåí congrats! !!
29 Sep 2014 13:37 - Tegan: Party cones!
29 Sep 2014 14:45 - Sam Roberts: I love itsu! The rare salmon steak is one of my all time favorite work lunches
29 Sep 2014 15:14 - Tegan: They leave a lot to be desired in the world of noodle soups
29 Sep 2014 15:15 - Tegan: Tomato soup isn't Japanese!
29 Sep 2014 15:15 - Tegan: They have taken 'fusion' to a terrible place
29 Sep 2014 15:23 - Hannah Murphy: Soup is poor but their sushi is the top
29 Sep 2014 15:27 - Tegan: They also don't do any veg sushi really
29 Sep 2014 15:27 - Tegan: Which makes wasabi my lunchtime fave
29 Sep 2014 15:33 - Angela: Itsu used to have some really nice veggie potsu but they have got rid of them and replaced them with chicken and duck. I was mighty disappointed and now all their veggie food sucks
29 Sep 2014 15:34 - Angela: Apart from "selected stores", lucky bastards.
29 Sep 2014 15:35 - Angela: Best veggie sushi is crushh. Crussh?
29 Sep 2014 15:35 - Angela: It all looks wrong!
30 Sep 2014 09:32 - Hannah Murphy: <Media omitted>
30 Sep 2014 09:32 - Hannah Murphy: Really hard to tell if my baby cousin loves or hates her mum
30 Sep 2014 09:32 - Hannah Murphy: I often misspell 'dear' tbh

30 Sep 2014 13:27 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: Is he in front of an oven? Nice touch.
30 Sep 2014 16:03 - Angela: I don't even know how to express how that comment made me feel
30 Sep 2014 16:03 - Angela: A cross between amusement and horror
30 Sep 2014 16:04 - Angela: üôÄüòøüòπ
30 Sep 2014 16:27 - Alex Bunn: Lol well noticed!
30 Sep 2014 17:55 - Sam Roberts: Sooo... my band's playing tonight

30 Sep 2014 20:51 - Vanessa: They didn't have tickets
30 Sep 2014 20:52 - Vanessa: They used their charm to get in
30 Sep 2014 21:04 - Alex Bunn: Gay
30 Sep 2014 21:22 - Sam Roberts: I changed the bouncer's perception of homoerotica
30 Sep 2014 21:22 - Sam Roberts: Nohomo
30 Sep 2014 21:23 - Bongo: Everything about that sentence was indeedhomo
30 Sep 2014 21:23 - Bongo: That's like saying "I hate Jews"

30 Sep 2014 21:25 - Alex Bunn: <Media omitted>
30 Sep 2014 22:06 - Owen: Whats the story sam?
30 Sep 2014 23:08 - Sam Roberts: That's about it really
30 Sep 2014 23:09 - Sam Roberts: Had no tickets, chatted with the bouncer, turns out he's a really nice guy who loves my milkshake
30 Sep 2014 23:09 - Sam Roberts: Free tickets for everyone
1 Oct 2014 07:56 - Owen: Sounds like he changed your perception then.
1 Oct 2014 20:07 - Vanessa: Is anybody interested in seeing the Nick Cave movie 20,000 days?
1 Oct 2014 20:17 - Tegan: I'd be up for that
1 Oct 2014 20:28 - Vanessa: They are showing it at the Prince Charles
1 Oct 2014 20:48 - Krizia: I'll be up for that as well! When?
1 Oct 2014 20:53 - Vanessa: I was thinking Sat during the day just because they predict it to be raining
1 Oct 2014 20:53 - Vanessa: But I'm flexible
1 Oct 2014 20:54 - Tegan: Could do....
1 Oct 2014 20:54 - Tegan: I don't have plans
1 Oct 2014 20:54 - Tegan: I don't think

1 Oct 2014 20:55 - Krizia: Mmmm let me check!!! I have tickets to a thing I just need to know at what time it starts!
1 Oct 2014 20:55 - Tegan: That is very inconsiderate of them
1 Oct 2014 21:38 - Hannah Murphy: If anybody free tomorrow, em Pearce and I are going to a free gig at the shoreditch town hall - sexy French accordion player and gypsy band if you're into that

6 Oct 2014 13:26 - Angela: The cat is slightly high maintenance - the one time we ever left her alone overnight she brought a revenge pigeon into the house (her only ever kill), so as long as you can be in the house at least at some point overnight she should be fine!
6 Oct 2014 13:27 - Angela: I live in streatham btw if that's ok for you?
6 Oct 2014 14:32 - Owen: Angela you could train your cat to go to the loo like the cat in meet the parents.

14 Oct 2014 10:57 - Krizia: Hoho no I really don't know!! Joe?
14 Oct 2014 10:59 - Owen: Why do you want to learn spanish dave. Are you planning on eloping with kritzia, much to sam's dismay?
14 Oct 2014 11:00 - Dave: Erm.....no?
14 Oct 2014 11:00 - Owen: Sounds suspicious.
14 Oct 2014 11:00 - Krizia: Why won't you learn Spanish??
14 Oct 2014 11:01 - Krizia: It's a beaaauuuttiiful language
14 Oct 2014 11:05 - Hannah Murphy: Go on international house
14 Oct 2014 11:06 - Hannah Murphy: They do semi -intensive courses (twice a week) for only 25¬£ - if you do a special option where you're being taught by trainee teachers (rather than qualified ones)
14 Oct 2014 11:09 - Dave: I saw that it was cheap - is the teaching good?
14 Oct 2014 11:49 - Joe Jarman: What do you want, start from basics book style learning, conversation practice or wat?
14 Oct 2014 11:50 - Joe Jarman: I've never had a spanish lesson üòê
14 Oct 2014 11:56 - Dave: I'll need to start from the very beginning. I like the idea of some lessons to get the conversational side and it's nice to have a teacher.
14 Oct 2014 11:56 - Dave: What did you do before going travelling?
14 Oct 2014 11:57 - Sam Roberts: I'd be interested in joining if you find something Dave, I've always wondered what Kriz is saying
14 Oct 2014 11:59 - Krizia: Hahahhaha!!! You don't want to know ;)
14 Oct 2014 11:59 - Joe Jarman: I watched a lot of tv and had a spanish lady friend aaaand did an audio course a while ago. Went to Espa√±a a few times, did duolingo which is great but you can't beat conversation practice with local people
14 Oct 2014 11:59 - Joe Jarman: Because that's your end goal right
14 Oct 2014 12:00 - Joe Jarman: So check out italki and verbling web sites
14 Oct 2014 12:00 - Joe Jarman: There's butcket loads of spics to Make friends with in London too ÓêÖ
14 Oct 2014 12:02 - Joe Jarman: I think I'm shit now because of a lack of conversation practice but I still understand a lot
14 Oct 2014 12:03 - Sam Roberts: I got on really well with duolingo, really fun way to learn some basics, I feel like a commitment now would help a lot though
14 Oct 2014 12:05 - Owen: Just shout loads and say everything is beuuutiiifullll. Thats spanish isn't it?
14 Oct 2014 12:18 - Joe Jarman: That's what krizea does definitely Óêâ

14 Oct 2014 13:08 - Sam Roberts: She's a bit molesty as a teacher, you probably want to study somewhere public

22 Oct 2014 10:17 - Alex Bunn: A woman is out playing golf and she gets stung by a bee. It's annoying, but she finishes her game. Afterwards, she's having a drink in the clubhouse and mentions to one of the golf pros hanging out there what happened.
"Oh that's too bad," he says. "Where did you get stung?"
"Right between the first and second hole," she tells him.
"Hmmm," he says, "Sounds like your stance is too wide."

22 Oct 2014 18:35 - Sam Roberts: Relay is better than whatsapp

23 Oct 2014 11:54 - Owen: That is the kind of sweet shit I'm talking about shaggy. Who wants a cure for malaria when we could have ninja turtles. Once you have ninja turtles the cure for malaria inevitably follows.

23 Oct 2014 18:07 - Adimina: Do we win a live Simpson?
23 Oct 2014 18:07 - Dave: Yeah but any self respecting Simpsons quiz would write most of them off.
23 Oct 2014 18:16 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: I bet it will be crazily hard
23 Oct 2014 18:17 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: Like "who took over as head writer in 1996?"

23 Oct 2014 19:08 - Tegan: Does that pub exist? Or would you just like to go to a pub of that name?

30 Oct 2014 12:13 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: What the fuck did you just fucking say about me, you little bitch? I‚Äôll have you know I graduated top of my class in the Navy Seals, and I‚Äôve been involved in numerous secret raids on Al-Quaeda, and I have over 300 confirmed kills. I am trained in gorilla warfare and I‚Äôm the top sniper in the entire US armed forces. You are nothing to me but just another target. I will wipe you the fuck out with precision the likes of which has never been seen before on this Earth, mark my fucking words. You think you can get away with saying that shit to me over the Internet? Think again, fucker. As we speak I am contacting my secret network of spies across the¬†USAand your IP is being traced right now so you better prepare for the storm, maggot. The storm that wipes out the pathetic little thing you call your life. You‚Äôre fucking dead, kid. I can be anywhere, anytime, and I can kill you in over seven hundred ways, and that‚Äôs just with my bare hands. Not only am I extensively trained in unarmed combat, but I have access to the entire arsenal of the United States Marine Corps and I will use it to its full extent to wipe your miserable ass off the face of the continent, you little shit. If only you could have known what unholy retribution your little ‚Äúclever‚Äù comment was about to bring down upon you, maybe you would have held your fucking tongue. But you couldn‚Äôt, you didn‚Äôt, and now you‚Äôre paying the price, you goddamn idiot. I will shit fury all over you and you will drown in it. You‚Äôre fucking dead, kiddo.

4 Nov 2014 12:09 - Joe Jarman: Failing that, ben thanh market
4 Nov 2014 12:09 - Adimina: Haha
4 Nov 2014 12:56 - Owen: For a while i was trying to understand that as some racist joke. "Are black people often homeless or something?!"

Then i realised you meant the camping shop.
4 Nov 2014 12:59 - Owen: Maybe they are avid campers. Thats not a sterotype I have heard though.
4 Nov 2014 13:05 - Adimina: Racist Owen
4 Nov 2014 13:08 - Joe Jarman: Black people hate camping, thus more.likely to give up sleeping bags?! Óêâ

4 Nov 2014 17:08 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: 4 MORE YEARS! 4 MORE YEARS!
4 Nov 2014 19:01 - Lorna: Maybe you could afford a deposit and buy the house if you all club together...
4 Nov 2014 19:04 - Owen: You clearly haven't seen how much money that house spends on beer lorna üòÉ
4 Nov 2014 19:05 - Owen: They could probably get the deposit by saving up a week's worth of empties and selling the aluminum.
4 Nov 2014 19:11 - Bongo: Yea but then the cleaner wouldn't have anything to pick up
4 Nov 2014 19:26 - Sam Roberts: Can't believe she's lasted so long
4 Nov 2014 19:26 - Sam Roberts: Even through bin-gate, and this Saturday's binge fest
4 Nov 2014 19:28 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: Didn't the landlord get it for like 50k?
4 Nov 2014 21:26 - Sam Roberts: ¬£50 and a bag full of nails
4 Nov 2014 21:55 - Bongo: Lol bin-gate
4 Nov 2014 21:57 - Bongo: Some witch was like "have this house on yonder but beware! mould grows everywhere, ye shall be plagued by rats and forever there will be the foulest stench enflicted upon man"
4 Nov 2014 21:57 - Bongo: But lucky for him he found you guys
4 Nov 2014 22:13 - Owen: I think the foul stench will clear itself right up when phil goes abroad for a bit.
4 Nov 2014 22:21 - Sam Roberts: That's the only thing keeping the mould at bay

5 Nov 2014 12:57 - Owen: A conversation i just overheard between two kids: "do you think scorpion from mortal kombat could overcome the combined might of the chaos gods on battle?"... I teach such nerds!
5 Nov 2014 12:57 - Owen: They are literally like comic book guy from the simpsons.
5 Nov 2014 12:58 - Sam Roberts: .... well could he?
5 Nov 2014 13:01 - Adimina: <Media omitted>
5 Nov 2014 13:01 - Adimina: Look who's come to say hello
5 Nov 2014 13:03 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: Scorpion ain't all that
5 Nov 2014 13:33 - Phil: Shut your dirty mouth mike you sub human sub zero fanboy. Obviously scorpion can't battle all the chaos gods but he'd do better than pretty much anyone else.
5 Nov 2014 14:07 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: People just like scorpion cause of the stupid sob story. He's like those contestants on X factor who are on there cause their dad died even though everyone knows they won't win
5 Nov 2014 14:14 - Alex Bunn: üëèüëè
5 Nov 2014 14:29 - Phil: The sob story came later when the drooling masses couldn't handle that a bad ass ninja had no back story beyond being a bad ass ninja.
5 Nov 2014 14:48 - Shaggy: Yellow is a pretty awesome colour
5 Nov 2014 14:50 - Owen: Scorpion is a pretty awesome animal.
5 Nov 2014 15:26 - Dave: Skulls are cool
5 Nov 2014 15:43 - Shaggy: And so is fire
5 Nov 2014 16:00 - Phil: Also, harpoons.
5 Nov 2014 16:13 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: These are dumb arguments
5 Nov 2014 16:16 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: He's a cheap-ass teleporting bitch
5 Nov 2014 16:19 - Phil: Someone got his ass beat by scorpion to many times. He was just the vessel man.

9 Nov 2014 20:14 - Martha: Yes. Have to buy them in advance since it usually sells out. There may not be many left next to each other though. Would people prefer to be loners sitting on their own or should we go for Tuesday?
9 Nov 2014 20:15 - Sam Roberts: I'm totally climbing Tuesday, well in for tomorrow though

9 Nov 2014 21:07 - Sam Roberts: The horde, always
9 Nov 2014 21:08 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: I prefer Tues at the Barbican

11 Nov 2014 09:42 - Dave: Can you imagine?
11 Nov 2014 10:48 - Sam Roberts: Thought it was a super racist headline in first glance, I'm much happier at the thought of ninja terrorist Mike
11 Nov 2014 12:46 - Phil: I think that is the closest anyone can reasonably come to being called a teenage mutant ninja turtle by a newspaper. Congrats mike.

11 Nov 2014 19:51 - Lorna: I'm super close
11 Nov 2014 20:12 - Shaggy: We're in the barbican centre, need to go to level -2
12 Nov 2014 10:32 - Alex Bunn: I think interstellar is worth a second watch
12 Nov 2014 10:33 - Alex Bunn: With lowered expectations
12 Nov 2014 10:33 - Alex Bunn: There was a lot to be appreciated in that film
12 Nov 2014 10:33 - Alex Bunn: But there was also a lot that was lame
12 Nov 2014 10:34 - Owen: Phil needs to see it again definitely. Because he spent half the film in the loo
12 Nov 2014 10:34 - Alex Bunn: Shit. Probably not worth a convo here cos theres peeps that havnt seen it
12 Nov 2014 10:34 - Henry Dranks: I absolutely loved it. beautiful homage to some of my fav scifi
12 Nov 2014 10:34 - Sam Roberts: It's weird, I really enjoyed maybe 9/10 of it, but felt cheated by the end
12 Nov 2014 10:34 - Owen: The last 15 minutes just shouldn't have been in the film
12 Nov 2014 10:35 - Tegan: Lots of Sci Fi films s have that quality though
12 Nov 2014 10:36 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: Yeah like Source Code
12 Nov 2014 10:37 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: Interstellar was pretty daft, can't say I wasn't entertained though
12 Nov 2014 10:37 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: Low marks for the Barbican cinema though
12 Nov 2014 10:37 - Shaggy: I think Matthew mcconaghey had a speech impediment, did he have a stroke?
12 Nov 2014 10:37 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: I think its more that the sound was shit
12 Nov 2014 10:38 - Owen: Yeah barbican cinema was rubbish
12 Nov 2014 10:38 - Owen: Barbican't  more like! Amiright?!
12 Nov 2014 10:38 - Alex Bunn: Yeah i think we might have had a better experience somewhere else
12 Nov 2014 10:38 - Alex Bunn: My fave was the sarcastic robot
12 Nov 2014 10:38 - Shaggy: IMAX
12 Nov 2014 10:49 - Martha: Meh, I agree the screen was pretty weeny, but it was nice to go somewhere close to me for once. Thank you folks for coming to my neck of the woods! That wins you 3 times I don't complain about going east :)
12 Nov 2014 10:49 - Martha: Sarcastic robot wins it.
12 Nov 2014 10:50 - Owen: Marthican't more like! Amiright folks!?
12 Nov 2014 10:50 - Owen: üêõ
12 Nov 2014 10:51 - Sam Roberts: Could've done with subtitles
12 Nov 2014 10:51 - Martha: I just realised: you know that film 'contact' I said it was quite like? Matthew mcconnorghdkdkd was in that too.
12 Nov 2014 10:52 - Sam Roberts: I liked the barbican centre though, felt like we were running through a Kafka novel to get there
12 Nov 2014 10:52 - Martha: Yes to subtitles, then we might have been able to understand over bun's rustling.
12 Nov 2014 10:54 - Sam Roberts: Hahaha I'd forgotten that! Full points for rustling bunny!
12 Nov 2014 11:30 - Alex Bunn: Shouldve munched during re-entry
12 Nov 2014 11:31 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: Or during one of those organ solos
12 Nov 2014 11:33 - Joe Jarman: Anyone left who hasn't seen it?
12 Nov 2014 11:33 - Joe Jarman: I want to go today üòÑ
12 Nov 2014 12:04 - Phil: I went for one perfectly timed piss. I missed a few minutes of crying and "daddy please don't go".

14 Nov 2014 11:14 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: <Media omitted>
14 Nov 2014 11:14 - Tegan: I think Mike also counts each consecutive Newgate from one person as one message
14 Nov 2014 11:15 - Tegan: So you need to be more strategic

14 Nov 2014 11:24 - Owen: OP will deliver....?
14 Nov 2014 11:33 - Sam Roberts: *did. I wonder if text typos are improving humanity's lateral thinking. It's like every fifth message is a little logic puzzle

14 Nov 2014 12:18 - Owen: Sam better be careful because someone likes italians too much.
14 Nov 2014 12:19 - Tegan: (The idea that that is shaggy's problem is more than gently misogynistic)
14 Nov 2014 12:20 - Owen: Dave! Get your woman back in line. She is talking out of turn!
14 Nov 2014 12:22 - Tegan: Looking for an emoji to express my feminist vitriol...

5 Dec 2014 14:14 - Martha: Not much to be honest! It looks a bit richer here and there (fancy tv screens, scary automatic video capture in all of the lecture rooms) but it's still a nostalgia bonanza.
5 Dec 2014 14:22 - Tegan: Nice
5 Dec 2014 15:55 - Dave: How did your talk go?
5 Dec 2014 16:00 - Martha: Went well, thanks!!

7 Dec 2014 02:48 - Alex Bunn: And then i had to get the super cool nightbus home

8 Dec 2014 18:22 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: <Media omitted>
8 Dec 2014 19:27 - Vinay: Lol
8 Dec 2014 19:28 - Vinay: I'm up for skating on Wednesday... Hopefully it won't be raining
9 Dec 2014 13:36 - Dave: Would anyone like to take my place kayaking from Limehouse to the Victoria park winter wonderland thing? It clashes with my work Xmas meal. Happy to offer the ticket at a good discount. X
9 Dec 2014 13:46 - Shaggy: Lol you have to pay money to do it?!
9 Dec 2014 14:18 - Joe Jarman: Yeah it sounds pretty brutal kayaking in this weather
9 Dec 2014 14:19 - Tegan: We didn't remember what cold was like when we signed up
9 Dec 2014 14:19 - Tegan: I'm probably going to end up in tears
9 Dec 2014 14:20 - Tegan: Good group though- Petia etc
9 Dec 2014 14:21 - Phil: Is petia a group or a person?
9 Dec 2014 14:22 - Joe Jarman: I like those guys
9 Dec 2014 14:22 - Joe Jarman: Petias not a big joe jarman fan
9 Dec 2014 14:22 - Joe Jarman: I think I consumed something naughty off her macbook

9 Dec 2014 14:23 - Tegan: You should come to winter wonderland for the aftermath
9 Dec 2014 14:23 - Joe Jarman: But I have my work party tomorrow
9 Dec 2014 14:23 - Tegan: Il have stopped crying by then
9 Dec 2014 14:23 - Tegan: Ah well
9 Dec 2014 14:45 - Sam Roberts: Who's organising? Well there be wet suits?
9 Dec 2014 14:46 - Tegan: BYO :(
9 Dec 2014 14:47 - Sam Roberts: Winter wonderland would be an excellent meet up and skate place
9 Dec 2014 14:47 - +44 7944 609055 left
9 Dec 2014 14:52 - Shaggy: I would cut your losses right now and bail, like em just now
9 Dec 2014 14:57 - Sam Roberts: That'd be awesome with a proper suit+ gloves
9 Dec 2014 15:08 - Tegan: Nah,  I'm gon' do it.  Join us after for mulled wine? Is there an ice rink at the Victoria Park winterthingaling?
9 Dec 2014 15:08 - Sam Roberts: I'll give you 40% survival without
9 Dec 2014 15:21 - Alex Bunn: In victoria park yes there is obe
9 Dec 2014 19:30 - Dave: Sam, sounds like you'd like my ticket...
9 Dec 2014 19:33 - Sam Roberts: Gimme a wetsuit and I'm there!
9 Dec 2014 19:33 - Sam Roberts: How much are the tickets?
9 Dec 2014 19:34 - Phil: Surely you can't kayak in this weather without a wetsuit. This is a country where they barely trust people near ankle deep water without a 2m railing and some barbed wire
9 Dec 2014 19:36 - Dave: I'm loathed to say how much the tickets were but for you, ¬£15.
9 Dec 2014 19:41 - Tegan: Brown wooded butttocks

9 Dec 2014 19:49 - Sam Roberts: That all worked out nicely! Need anything from the shop Phil?
9 Dec 2014 19:50 - Phil: Depends if you want stir fry. If yes, read house bants.
9 Dec 2014 20:21 - Tegan: Hope I didn't put you out of your way with my Wolf boy beer cry
9 Dec 2014 20:24 - Sam Roberts: Made me leave the office as it happens, I'm cook with that woolfie

10 Dec 2014 12:12 - Sam Roberts: Victoria park for winter wonderland + seeing if Teeg survives
10 Dec 2014 12:13 - Sam Roberts: The guys can skate and the ladies can drink mulled wine and watch
10 Dec 2014 13:29 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: Apparently we're going to WW after the office Xmas party on Friday
10 Dec 2014 13:30 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: What could go wrong
10 Dec 2014 13:31 - Shaggy: What's that?

10 Dec 2014 13:54 - Dave: Looks like I'm gonna be kayaking too. The more warm hugs the better at vikkie park
10 Dec 2014 16:38 - Sam Roberts: Sooo I've got a heap still to do, looks like I might be stuck here for the night :(
10 Dec 2014 16:39 - Sam Roberts: You got to love having a nice relaxing morning , then finding a shitstorm when you get back
10 Dec 2014 16:52 - Owen: What time and where are people going to be?

10 Dec 2014 18:10 - Alex Bunn: Pub in London Bridge?
10 Dec 2014 18:11 - Sam Roberts: No word from teeg and Dave, I think they've succumbed to hypothermia already
10 Dec 2014 18:12 - Sam Roberts: I'm going to be stuck here couple of hours at least, might come join if you're out though
10 Dec 2014 18:13 - Alex Bunn: Thats what i was hoping for. Need to organise something due to my lack of phone network and dependency on wifi
10 Dec 2014 18:13 - Alex Bunn: Phil if we decide will you come?
10 Dec 2014 18:24 - Alex Bunn: Ok i'm going home
10 Dec 2014 18:24 - Alex Bunn: Bye
10 Dec 2014 18:29 - Phil: Guess not
10 Dec 2014 18:29 - Phil: üêí

10 Dec 2014 22:30 - Tegan: Yup, kayaking is also pretty toasty it turns out :)
10 Dec 2014 22:31 - Lorna: How was the winterville thing?

11 Dec 2014 16:12 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: Rice + laxative?
11 Dec 2014 16:13 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: Favourite business terms at qubit seem to be 'deep-dive (into)' and 'verticals'
11 Dec 2014 16:16 - Phil: Urban dictionary word of the day: a crapella
11 Dec 2014 16:30 - Tegan: We're always deep diving into verticals
11 Dec 2014 16:30 - Tegan: Do you do much silo-ing?
11 Dec 2014 17:43 - Bongo: My favourite business term is haircut
11 Dec 2014 17:43 - Bongo: Although it's only a financial one

14 Dec 2014 11:20 - Owen: Why was she removed instead of leaving? Bit rude, no?
14 Dec 2014 11:20 - Alex Bunn: Pipe down
14 Dec 2014 11:42 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: I think you can get removed for inactivity, or not paying the 67p charge
14 Dec 2014 13:19 - Owen: That answers my question much better than "pipe down."
14 Dec 2014 13:22 - Owen: Phil said there was something going on today. Is that the case? Shall we bring beer?

28 Dec 2014 22:06 - Phil left
28 Dec 2014 22:07 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: <Media omitted>
28 Dec 2014 22:07 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: NOOOO
28 Dec 2014 23:10 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: Well, I for one am shocked, saddened, and quite drunk by the lack of uproar at this loss.  People leave this group all the time. Usually if I have any reaction at all, it's a positive one. Good riddance says I, for a herd of buffulo can only move as fast as its slowest, and least comical member.  But tonight, we have lost a true The Horde titan. He never contributed a lot, but everything he did was hilariously accurate, terse, and withering in execution. He will be sorely missed.

29 Dec 2014 18:14 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: Deal.
29 Dec 2014 18:33 - Owen: That explains why the beer would be better.
29 Dec 2014 18:37 - Sam Roberts: The other Brown's
29 Dec 2014 18:45 - Owen: I like how bongo knows all the strip clubs.

6 Jan 16:34 - Shaggy: Well not documentary but whatever
6 Jan 16:39 - Alex Bunn: Wtf is that movie?
6 Jan 16:40 - Owen: Maybe. However i can imagine the film being about motor neuron disease instead of black hole mathematics like it should be!
6 Jan 16:42 - Joe Jarman: Can't ya just come round and make pie already
6 Jan 16:46 - Tegan: I think it's mainly about stevesy. With some black hole mathematics.
6 Jan 16:46 - Tegan: It is named erroneously
6 Jan 16:46 - Tegan: S' meant to be aiight though
6 Jan 16:47 - Tegan: No pie

7 Jan 08:44 - Sam Roberts: We're going tonight... Friday drinks to break it down?
7 Jan 09:19 - Joe Jarman: Aww my god, that was the most racist haircut ever

7 Jan 09:25 - Joe Jarman: My haircut is normal it was just delivered in a racist way
7 Jan 09:26 - Joe Jarman: Peter's hairdresser at the end of our road
7 Jan 09:36 - Tegan: I don't know if you guys should be financially spring racists
7 Jan 09:36 - Tegan: Supporting
7 Jan 09:36 - Tegan: Do you have to ask him race related questions to hear it,  or does the hate just come pouring out?
7 Jan 09:37 - Owen: "So what kind of negro haircut do you want today. Also i think the pakis shouldn't be allowed the vote."
7 Jan 09:37 - Owen: That kind of racist?
7 Jan 09:58 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: In my experience, most of his hate is at eastern Europeans
7 Jan 09:58 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: And immigrants in general
7 Jan 09:58 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: Which is weird because he's Italian
7 Jan 10:01 - Owen: Well all those poles come over here and eat our pasta.
7 Jan 10:15 - Joe Jarman: He is italian
7 Jan 10:16 - Joe Jarman: But he was here before we were even born apparently
7 Jan 10:16 - Joe Jarman: Which is amazing coz his english is really poor

7 Jan 12:00 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: We went there last time, how about the spoons?
7 Jan 12:02 - Owen: Wherever we go I will sit in a corner crying about the lack of booze.
7 Jan 12:03 - Owen: Can i smell your beer please mike?
7 Jan 12:06 - Tegan: Mike's on the white wine
7 Jan 12:06 - Tegan: Spritzeritzeritzers

7 Jan 12:08 - Owen: Can i smell your wine then. Just a whiff, thats all I need!
7 Jan 12:09 - Lorna: Yay beer and film! I'm sold.
7 Jan 12:10 - Tegan: Is anyone on orange?
7 Jan 12:13 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: My Dad, I got one
7 Jan 12:13 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: This may be why they're stopping it
7 Jan 12:50 - Owen: Eliza is with ee. I think they do it as well.
7 Jan 12:52 - Lorna: Same thing, ee is a merge of orange and t mobile. Maybe t mobile wear the trousers which is why orange Wednesdays is finishing
7 Jan 12:57 - Shaggy: They are same thing but if you were with t mobile you don't get orange Wednesday now
7 Jan 14:12 - Alex Bunn: <Media omitted>
7 Jan 14:12 - Alex Bunn: Simpsons gags are the best!
7 Jan 14:17 - Shaggy: I don't get it. Is that a deliberate misspelling?
7 Jan 14:18 - Alex Bunn: Itchy and scrathy land episode. Do your homework
7 Jan 14:18 - Alex Bunn: I'm disappointed
7 Jan 14:19 - Tegan: The gag is weakened by the fact that you can get a bart mug right next to it
7 Jan 14:20 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: omg Shaggy, like seriously

7 Jan 15:03 - Tegan: Who do I call? ?
7 Jan 15:09 - Alex Bunn: Infiltrate their circle of trust
7 Jan 15:14 - Tegan: Probable false alarm.  I think they're just idiots.
7 Jan 15:14 - Tegan: Probably rich idiots.
7 Jan 15:22 - Shaggy: She sells Seychelles
7 Jan 15:27 - Tegan: But where?
7 Jan 15:31 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: On the East African real estate market
7 Jan 15:46 - Owen: Tell them you can help them. Then steal all thier money. Stealings not wrong if you do it to rich idiots... like Kevin Bacon

7 Jan 16:04 - Tegan: Wisdom
7 Jan 16:38 - Sam Roberts: Never knew that! Most awesome!
7 Jan 16:38 - Sam Roberts: Just when you thought spoons couldn't get cheaper or more cheerful
7 Jan 16:39 - Sam Roberts: Everyone aiming for 7 then? I might be a touch early
7 Jan 16:41 - Tegan: Early sounds good
7 Jan 16:42 - Tegan: I still can't quite engender what my job is or why it's important
7 Jan 16:42 - Tegan: Remember,  dammit
7 Jan 16:42 - Tegan: This swipe business is getting worse and worse
7 Jan 16:47 - Lorna: I'll be a bit early. Is it 20% off drinks too?
7 Jan 16:55 - Tegan: I dunnoo
7 Jan 16:56 - Dave: Nah, but this is spoons so drinks are reasonable, even on the wharf.
7 Jan 17:03 - Alex Bunn: Cheapskates
7 Jan 17:04 - Tegan: Such a long time til payday...

9 Jan 08:40 - Pete Morey: <Media omitted>
9 Jan 08:43 - Tegan: Government is a dirty perv
9 Jan 08:43 - Tegan: But the individual loves it
9 Jan 08:48 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: Apparently if you have Android, whatsapp is super secure
9 Jan 08:48 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: Like not even WhatsApp can read your messages, only the other persons exact phone
9 Jan 08:49 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: So we can finally make that terrorist cell group we've been talking about
9 Jan 08:49 - Shaggy: Unless of course you then email yourself the whole thread so that you can analyze who is most worthy in the eyes of Muhammad
9 Jan 08:53 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: Lol
9 Jan 09:00 - Pete Morey: Oops...
9 Jan 09:17 - Owen: Suprisingly Sam won Muhammad's favour.

9 Jan 13:34 - Hannah Murphy: Now there's two hostage situations in France  at the same time that are linked
9 Jan 13:38 - Bongo: Stay safe
9 Jan 13:39 - Bongo: Hide up the eifel tower until it's all over

19 Jan 21:01 - Owen: Yeah what the hell?! Did you hire your years supply of cleaners all at once?
19 Jan 21:01 - Owen: Or maybe it was shaggy causing all the mess all along.
19 Jan 21:03 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: Man you should see the projector room

22 Jan 14:14 - Sam Roberts: Pretty sure it isn't dude...
22 Jan 14:14 - Sam Roberts: You having that thing where you hear a word for the first time, then it's everywhere all of a sudden?
22 Jan 14:14 - Sam Roberts: I'm sure there'a a conspiracy around that
22 Jan 14:22 - Angela: There's a theory that says when you learn another language, you hear a word regularly without taking it in it for ages, and then one day when your ability gets good enough you suddenly 'notice' it and either understand it through context or you look it up or whatever. Then after that, you notice it every time it's said because you know it's there. Which is spooky if it's also true in English, cos it means you're just deaf to this word for years but it's actually been there all along.......
22 Jan 14:23 - Alex Bunn: Good fact!
22 Jan 14:23 - Sam Roberts: Oh god, have you all being talking about jingoistic braggadocio all this time!? I've been dead to it until now!

24 Jan 10:48 - Shaggy: Life without beer is like beer without alcohol
24 Jan 12:35 - Martha: I have some work but would enjoy a microbrew later

24 Jan 16:03 - Alex Bunn: Gonna cook dinner instead üòã
24 Jan 16:37 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: There's this demented airport up a mountain in courchevel
24 Jan 16:37 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: <Media omitted>
24 Jan 16:37 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: Youtube it, its crazy
24 Jan 17:01 - Lorna: <Media omitted>
24 Jan 17:03 - Alex Bunn: My uncle has flown his plane into that airport
24 Jan 17:05 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: Your uncle is mental
24 Jan 17:22 - Vanessa: How come I've never heard about this uncle
24 Jan 17:23 - Alex Bunn: Well unfortunately he's not with us anymore üòì
24 Jan 17:25 - Shaggy: Heaven is halfpipe
24 Jan 17:29 - Joe Jarman: Hey shagz gonna restart your thing
24 Jan 17:30 - Joe Jarman: Thin it's almost done
24 Jan 17:45 - Shaggy: I thought it was done
24 Jan 18:28 - Sam Roberts: Home brew!
24 Jan 18:28 - Sam Roberts: Hey, don't put it on yet
24 Jan 18:29 - Sam Roberts: We'll be done with this keg in a week, then we can have a brew off
24 Jan 18:29 - Alex Bunn: Hows the micro breweries?
24 Jan 18:29 - Alex Bunn: (Shags and V)
24 Jan 18:37 - Shaggy: Exquisite flavour of hops makes you really question the totalitarian rule of major corporate beer companies enthral lung their rule of blandness on out temporary existence
24 Jan 18:43 - Alex Bunn: And who says beer kills brain cells
24 Jan 20:01 - Tegan: Bastards
24 Jan 20:02 - Vinay: Jon snow
24 Jan 20:12 - Lorna: Too late Sam- beer's a brewin'. But we're gonna bottle it so it'll keep for a brew off.
24 Jan 23:34 - Sam Roberts: It's ON!
24 Jan 23:34 - Sam Roberts: I'm going to find out how to brew for high percentage, make some home brew special brew
25 Jan 01:01 - Lorna: If you brew with 1/10th of the water, then it'll make beer 10 times as strong right?...
25 Jan 01:09 - Sam Roberts: Sounds legit
25 Jan 01:09 - Sam Roberts: Or with 10x the sugar
25 Jan 01:10 - Sam Roberts: I hear the alcohol is just a calculation on the sugar
25 Jan 05:47 - Shaggy: Really? Sweet
25 Jan 09:15 - Owen: Alcohol content is sugar and yeast strain. Beer yeast will die at a lower abv than wine yeast.
25 Jan 10:09 - Lorna: So... Add wine yeast instead! This syrupy, sweet wine special brew will definitely give you the shits. üí©
25 Jan 12:21 - Dave: Mix in a load of vodka too.
25 Jan 12:21 - Dave: (Pro tip)
25 Jan 15:45 - Sam Roberts: Enjoying all of these, keep them coming
25 Jan 15:45 - Sam Roberts: Combined, I should be able to get beer over 30%
25 Jan 15:45 - Sam Roberts: I shall call it Tombstone
25 Jan 15:46 - Shaggy: You can freeze it and separate alcohol, there's one you can get in brewdog that's 52%
25 Jan 15:48 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: I think at some point you can't call it beer anymore haha
25 Jan 15:48 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: Sorites pissed paradox
27 Jan 07:31 - Tegan: Whiplash tonight at the wharf?
27 Jan 07:42 - Lorna: Yes to whiplash. Can I suggest a more central cinema?
27 Jan 07:46 - Tegan: We'll probably wharf as Dave has to work late
27 Jan 07:47 - Tegan: If he finishes wallet we could maybe get elsewhere
27 Jan 07:47 - Tegan: Had to be a cineworld for half price Tuesday
27 Jan 08:01 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: Down for whiplash,
27 Jan 08:02 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: Wherever, as long as you decide by like 6
27 Jan 12:11 - Lorna: Tuesday deal is good. Were you thinking 6:10 or 8:50 for the film?
27 Jan 13:16 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: Will have to be 8.50 for me
27 Jan 14:11 - Tegan: 8.50 sounds aiight
27 Jan 18:06 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: What time to meet?
27 Jan 18:15 - Hannah Murphy: <Media omitted>
27 Jan 18:16 - Hannah Murphy: <Media omitted>
27 Jan 18:20 - Hannah Murphy: I'm guessing number 16 bus shelter may be referring to a place of conception?
27 Jan 18:20 - Lorna: I'm bailing on the cinema guys
27 Jan 18:23 - Alex Bunn: Lol that bus stop kid is a born winner!
27 Jan 18:41 - Vanessa: I was told that in Germany you have to ask permission on the name you want to give your child
27 Jan 18:41 - Tegan: Mike, are you still up for the wharf?
27 Jan 18:47 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: Sure

27 Jan 21:05 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: <Media omitted>

27 Jan 23:26 - Owen: Good then.
27 Jan 23:26 - Owen: ?
27 Jan 23:37 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: Well I don't want to overhype it
27 Jan 23:37 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: But I have already, so yeah its amazing, see it at the cinema
27 Jan 23:41 - Tegan: Hype hype hype!
27 Jan 23:41 - Tegan: Made me angry
27 Jan 23:41 - Tegan: But was good
27 Jan 23:43 - Dave: Was pretty great. Visceral, exhausting cinema. In a good way.
28 Jan 06:42 - Angela: Why did it make you angry teegs?
28 Jan 07:41 - Tegan: Either because it celebrated a sad cycle of dependency, or because I'll never be that good at anything
28 Jan 07:41 - Tegan: Probably the latter
28 Jan 07:48 - Angela: Getting old to the point where that becomes apparent is rubbish! No longer do I have potential üò¢
28 Jan 07:49 - Angela: I had so much potential!
28 Jan 07:51 - Sam Roberts: I've switched from aiming at rock climbing legend to sexy pensioner
28 Jan 07:56 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: I don't agree that it celebrated it Teegs, it was pretty neutral
28 Jan 08:05 - Alex Bunn: Lol Sam
28 Jan 08:06 - Owen: I'll just aim for pensioner
28 Jan 08:18 - Tegan: That's why I did probably the later
28 Jan 08:18 - Tegan: Latter
28 Jan 08:19 - Tegan: I expect
28 Jan 08:19 - Tegan: Also lol, sam
28 Jan 08:41 - Sam Roberts: Talking of becoming a pensioner, it's m' birthday next Friday (6th), save the date for some drinking fun
28 Jan 08:49 - Adam Wills: Saved! What are we gonna do?
28 Jan 09:10 - Sam Roberts: Working on it just at the mo, suggestions welcome
28 Jan 09:11 - Sam Roberts: The only certainty is that there will be beers

28 Jan 09:33 - Shaggy: Oh right
28 Jan 09:33 - Alex Bunn: Too early
28 Jan 09:35 - Tegan: Sorry y'all
28 Jan 09:35 - Tegan: The sound you can probably hear is me cursing the day
28 Jan 12:48 - Sam Roberts: <Media omitted>

29 Jan 15:59 - Joe Jarman: What time you there sam
29 Jan 15:59 - Joe Jarman: I'm celebrating dodging a bankruptcy bullet
29 Jan 16:00 - Alex Bunn: Did you get redundancy?
29 Jan 16:02 - Joe Jarman: Not yet haha
29 Jan 16:02 - Joe Jarman: I'm just thankful for my student overdraft

29 Jan 17:30 - Bongo: Sweet I'm in
29 Jan 17:31 - Bongo: Like beef shin
29 Jan 17:31 - Bongo: <Media omitted>
29 Jan 17:31 - Bongo: Rubbed in garlic, parsley salt and balsal, left to cook for 8 hours
29 Jan 17:32 - Owen: Stab holes in it and push the garlic into the holes. It caramalises and infuses the meat when it cooks.
29 Jan 17:33 - Joe Jarman: See you at dlr?
29 Jan 17:33 - Owen: Trust me. Its a may zing!
29 Jan 17:33 - Dave: I'll be there in a min
29 Jan 17:34 - Shaggy: Garlic caramelises?
29 Jan 17:35 - Joe Jarman: When
29 Jan 17:35 - Joe Jarman: I'm there
29 Jan 17:35 - Joe Jarman: Smoking
29 Jan 17:36 - Dave: Now
29 Jan 17:37 - Joe Jarman: Canne c u jimmee
29 Jan 17:47 - Owen: Yeah garlic caramalises. If you deprive it of oxygen.
29 Jan 17:48 - Owen: Try wrapping a bulb of garlic in foil and sticking it in the oven at 180 for an hour. It comes out sticky and sweet but still as garlicy.
29 Jan 17:49 - Shaggy: Sweet
29 Jan 17:51 - Tegan: Mmmmmm
29 Jan 17:51 - Tegan: I'm going for a leaving drink, will join y'all afters

29 Jan 19:50 - Sam Roberts: Opposite the fellow, but they don't have a pin so I used the fellow one
29 Jan 19:50 - Sam Roberts: To be fair, happy hours over, and they don't have any Nintendo do we should probs move on
29 Jan 19:51 - Sam Roberts: Here for now though
29 Jan 20:44 - Tegan: Whattupp y'all?
29 Jan 20:45 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: We're in the same place
29 Jan 20:49 - Tegan: Surely the appeal wears off at 7?

29 Jan 20:50 - Tegan: On my wat5
29 Jan 20:50 - Joe Jarman: It's still cheap!
29 Jan 20:50 - Tegan: Sright

29 Jan 20:58 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: Where there's a will there's a wat5
29 Jan 21:13 - Tegan: WAT5 MOTHERLICKERS
29 Jan 21:14 - Tegan: It's snowing
29 Jan 21:16 - Vinay: Where? Its dry as a baboons backside here
29 Jan 21:16 - Tegan: Kx
29 Jan 21:16 - Vinay: I got all excited
29 Jan 21:16 - Owen: Damn you teegs you made me look out the window.
29 Jan 21:16 - Owen: I was disappointed
29 Jan 21:17 - Vinay: Same
29 Jan 21:17 - Tegan: It won't settle
29 Jan 21:17 - Tegan: It's mainly damp
29 Jan 21:17 - Owen: Watch "Hercules - DISAPPOINTED" on YouTube - Hercules - DISAPPOINTED: http://youtu.be/_O1hM-k3aUY
29 Jan 21:17 - Tegan: Definite snowfall here though
30 Jan 09:32 - Martha: What plans for tonight? I'm in need of a chilled one - I'm thinking good food and films/episodes and a comfy couch. Shabong? Canning t? What say you?
30 Jan 09:35 - Shaggy: Team bonding exercise with work, meaning team bonds with alcohol, somewhere near work
30 Jan 09:35 - Owen: Whatever you do don't be hungover tomorrow Marth
30 Jan 09:36 - Alex Bunn: I'm going to a medieval banquet in st katherines docks
30 Jan 09:36 - Alex Bunn: Its gonna be ossum
30 Jan 09:41 - Tegan: I'm up for an episode of something Marth
30 Jan 09:41 - Tegan: I'm in c town
30 Jan 09:54 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: Someone told me a good comedy film called Chef came out last year, anyone up for that?
30 Jan 11:00 - Martha: Sure, awesome! Teegs - are you heading to Sutton on Saturday morning too? It will make the epic trek from canning t infinitely more enjoyable.
30 Jan 11:07 - Dave: I'd like to see chef - it's downloaded already
30 Jan 11:15 - Owen: 1 hour an epic trek does not make.
30 Jan 11:33 - Martha: Indeed, but 1h27 is getting there.
30 Jan 11:33 - Martha: <Media omitted>
30 Jan 11:34 - Sam Roberts: Uber
30 Jan 11:41 - Tegan: I think I'll have to wend my way home tonight as my laundry situation is pretty dire
30 Jan 11:41 - Tegan: But we can meet at lb or wherever the train goes from
30 Jan 11:52 - Owen: Thats a stupid way to go.
30 Jan 11:52 - Owen: Jubilee to Canada water. Overground to west croydon. Mainline to sutton.
30 Jan 11:53 - Owen: That is the best way. Takes about 1hour if you get the right train.
30 Jan 12:53 - Martha: Aw rats, I thought you and Dave were coming. Owen is there a critical number of people below which we might be forced to drink, eat cake and play Catan?
30 Jan 12:54 - Owen: Teegs is coming. Dave is not
30 Jan 12:55 - Owen: At the moment the list is: marth, teegs, steve, alice, lara, jim, eliza.
30 Jan 12:55 - Owen: So quite a few
30 Jan 13:41 - Lorna: By the way guys, chef is awesome! Comedy that gives you a warm gooey heartwarming feel. With shit loads of food porn. Eat before or line up and epic meat/cheese snack for afters.
30 Jan 14:07 - Alex Bunn: <Media omitted>
30 Jan 18:35 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: OK, so what do you think is the biggest animal by mass that you could have in a fight?
30 Jan 18:36 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: It is trying to kill you
30 Jan 18:36 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: No weapons, MMA octagon stylee
30 Jan 18:36 - Tegan: Could definitely take a cat
30 Jan 18:36 - Tegan: Or cat sized dog
30 Jan 18:36 - Owen: Blue whale.
30 Jan 18:37 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: Land animal
30 Jan 18:37 - Tegan: Probably not a Badger
30 Jan 18:37 - Owen: It's own weight would kill it in an mma octagon
30 Jan 18:39 - Lorna: Could definitely take a giant tortoise. Though its unlikely to ever try and kill me.
30 Jan 18:39 - Martha: Sloth
30 Jan 18:39 - Tegan: Good thinking lorna
30 Jan 18:39 - Tegan: Heavy but slow animals
30 Jan 18:40 - Owen: Maybe a crocodile. They can't open thier jaws if you apply a little force to them. I am not sure how I would kill it though. Maybe finger through the eye to the brain.
30 Jan 18:40 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: You could not even hope to hurt a tortoise though
30 Jan 18:41 - Owen: Kick it in the balls!
30 Jan 18:41 - Owen: No animal can cope with that.
30 Jan 18:41 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: Unless you flip it over and they're well heavy
30 Jan 18:42 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: I feel I could take a giraffe somehow
30 Jan 18:42 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: Would need a good strategy
30 Jan 18:42 - Owen: No way!
30 Jan 18:42 - Martha: I feel that you would find you cant
30 Jan 18:42 - Owen: Have you seen those fuckers fight?
30 Jan 18:43 - Owen: They neck whip each other.
30 Jan 18:43 - Owen: Giraffes are BAD ASS!
30 Jan 18:43 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: You got to trip it over somehow
30 Jan 18:43 - Shaggy: <Media omitted>
30 Jan 18:44 - Lorna: I'd flip that tortoise and elbow drop it. WWF style
30 Jan 18:46 - Tegan: Dang
30 Jan 18:47 - Lorna: Or a panda. Anyone could take a panda
30 Jan 18:49 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: Again, I think it would be tough to harm a panda
30 Jan 18:50 - Tegan: Are you allowed a rope?
30 Jan 18:50 - Alex Bunn: Yeah pandas suck
30 Jan 18:50 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: You'd have to hurt its feelings somehow
30 Jan 18:50 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: No ropes
30 Jan 18:50 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: I reckon a cow is doable
30 Jan 18:51 - Owen: A cow is basically a bull without horns though
30 Jan 18:51 - Tegan: Cows ares pretty solid
30 Jan 18:52 - Tegan: I reckon you could kick a sheep to death
30 Jan 18:52 - Owen: I don't really know how to kill any animal
30 Jan 18:52 - Owen: Except a chicken.
30 Jan 18:52 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: Giraffe you can strangle I reckon
30 Jan 18:52 - Martha: Guys this is pretty dark.
30 Jan 18:52 - Martha: Who started this?
30 Jan 18:52 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: Dave
30 Jan 18:53 - Martha: Mmm really?
30 Jan 18:53 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: Actually I'm continuing a convo from lunch
30 Jan 18:53 - Martha: My bets are on you for some reason
30 Jan 18:53 - Owen: I think you underestimate how big a giraffe's neck is.
30 Jan 18:53 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: It was much darker than this...
30 Jan 18:57 - Tegan: Mike, are you heading back to watch chef tonight?
30 Jan 18:57 - Bongo: A massive capybara
30 Jan 18:58 - Bongo: <Media omitted>
30 Jan 18:58 - Bongo: They're pretty much punching bags
30 Jan 18:59 - Bongo: They weigh a tonne and I bet they're so chilled they'd just let you punch them until they die
30 Jan 19:04 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: Yeah I'm at pub, leaving in 10
30 Jan 19:05 - Tegan: Aiight
30 Jan 19:37 - Dave: I could take an ostrich
30 Jan 19:38 - Martha: There in 30 xxx
30 Jan 19:38 - Dave: Whoop
30 Jan 19:38 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: Roman numeral bants
30 Jan 19:40 - Tegan: Niiice
30 Jan 19:47 - Bongo: I'm bored and ill, anyone want to come entertain me?
30 Jan 19:47 - Bongo: Probably one of the least tempting offers I've ever made but that just shows how extremely ill I am
30 Jan 20:15 - Tegan: Sorry dude - I'm being bored and ill over here
30 Jan 20:16 - Tegan: I would recommend the David Attenborough on the beeb about birds of paradise
30 Jan 20:16 - Tegan: The voice is medicine, and the birds are silly
30 Jan 20:29 - Tegan: Mike
30 Jan 20:29 - Tegan: Bring more wine
30 Jan 20:29 - Tegan: And Yorkshire puddings
30 Jan 20:30 - Tegan: Loads of Yorkshire puddings
30 Jan 20:30 - Dave: Plz
30 Jan 20:39 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: Yorkshire puddings?
30 Jan 20:39 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: Also Dave, are you nuts, an ostrich would kick your face off
30 Jan 20:40 - Dave: Yup x many
30 Jan 20:40 - Dave: Nah mate, I'd dodge it's kick and punch it in the beak
30 Jan 20:40 - Dave: BAM!
30 Jan 20:40 - Joe Jarman: Bongo
30 Jan 20:40 - Joe Jarman: Come here
30 Jan 20:40 - Joe Jarman: And we will look after you
30 Jan 20:40 - Joe Jarman: Ill send an uber
30 Jan 20:41 - Joe Jarman: Got some free credits
30 Jan 20:41 - Dave: Or maybe wrestle it
30 Jan 20:41 - Owen: Dave you can't dodge a balcony how are you gonna dodge an ostrich!?

6 Feb 18:21 - Bongo: On the bus, be there in 5 hours
6 Feb 18:21 - Bongo: Because that's how bloody long it takes to get anywhere on a bus in London
6 Feb 18:22 - Sam Roberts: Bus? You mean the peasant wagon
6 Feb 18:22 - Bongo: Amen
6 Feb 18:23 - Bongo: I bet none of these herberts have even ever tried gold-flecked champagne with their cereal before

7 Feb 08:23 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: Ow my brain üòñ
7 Feb 09:06 - Bongo: Lol I literally saw you passed out on the couch, did you wake up to text that?
7 Feb 09:14 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: Passed out from the overexertion of texting that
7 Feb 09:54 - Bongo: Children of the third world have to walk for 2 hours each day to get fresh water
7 Feb 09:54 - Bongo: But that's nothing compared to the harsh climates that some people live in the uk
7 Feb 09:54 - Bongo: Donate ¬£2 a month to provide mike with a monkey butler so that he doesn't have to waste energy texting
7 Feb 09:56 - Tegan: Can I have a monkey butler for ¬£2 a month?
7 Feb 09:56 - Tegan: I'm not after charity, I'll fund my own
7 Feb 10:02 - Bongo: Hmm yea I want one too
7 Feb 10:03 - Bongo: Screw mike, I'm getting a fleet of monkey butlers
7 Feb 10:03 - Bongo: Fleet is the collective noun for monkey butlers right?

7 Feb 21:40 - Sam Roberts: Looks like a dnd wet dream
7 Feb 21:49 - Pete Morey: Basically
10 Feb 14:13 - Bongo: That Strauss Khan sex party story is hilarious
10 Feb 14:13 - Bongo: "Okay I pimped girls at sex parties, but that was only like 12 times"
10 Feb 14:14 - Bongo: And someone else who regularly attended is all like "I was there for professional reasons" lol
10 Feb 15:57 - Owen: Give the guy a break he only had 12 sex parties over the course of 3 years. Thats a 3 month wait between sex parties. I have to wait less time between holidays!
10 Feb 15:58 - Owen: Also he, and I quote: "did it for fun." We can all sympathise with that nobel aim.
10 Feb 15:59 - Tegan: Classy
10 Feb 16:00 - Tegan: He was going to be the head of the IMF a few years ago
10 Feb 16:00 - Tegan: The IMF could use more sex patios
10 Feb 16:00 - Tegan: Parties dammit
10 Feb 16:03 - Owen: They face charges of "aggravated pimping." I know aggravated probably has a legal definition but i cannot stop picturing him as some kind of super pimp with mega chains and a massive furry hat.
10 Feb 16:04 - Owen: Sex patios also sound good teegs
10 Feb 16:11 - Hannah Murphy: Bongo give him some slack - it was 12 parties across three years, so only four a year
10 Feb 16:12 - Owen: Repost!!!
10 Feb 16:40 - Tegan: Who doesn't throw quarterly sex parties?
10 Feb 16:41 - Owen: They sink up with tax day
10 Feb 16:46 - Vanessa: Here's my rant, I can't believe after so many years with the 100ml rule at airport security you STILL get people completely dumbfounded when their shampoo gets taken away
10 Feb 16:47 - Owen: But I am special so surely the rules don't apply to me.
10 Feb 16:48 - Vanessa: Yes, I forgot, it's in the small print
10 Feb 17:08 - Shaggy: Oh I thought it's 100ml only for explosive liquids
10 Feb 17:27 - Tegan: Yup. Only solid explosives in larger quantities.
10 Feb 17:27 - Tegan: Or in they have to be in your checked luggage
10 Feb 18:32 - Bongo: And definitely no alan keys right Sam?
10 Feb 18:33 - Bongo: You terrorist
10 Feb 18:39 - Bongo: 1) who brings an alan key with them on holiday
10 Feb 18:40 - Bongo: 2) why does it get banned from taken on the flight
10 Feb 18:57 - Shaggy: I had bike tools taken away from me as well
10 Feb 20:29 - Sam Roberts: Fascists with their ridiculous rules on bike gear
10 Feb 20:30 - Sam Roberts: Must be to limit bike thefts in India
12 Feb 13:09 - Tegan: <Media omitted>

12 Feb 13:25 - Tegan: All Sri Lanka lacks is a big group of lads

12 Feb 13:43 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: Hitting the big Jesus this eve I think
12 Feb 13:44 - Tegan: Don't hit him
12 Feb 13:44 - Tegan: He had enough stick when he was alive
12 Feb 13:45 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: Yeah and you wouldn't like big Jesus when he's angry
12 Feb 13:46 - Tegan: Damn right
12 Feb 13:46 - Tegan: He is of second coming prop proportions
12 Feb 15:35 - Owen: I live!
12 Feb 15:53 - Owen: I thought I had killed my phone by rooting it. But i hadn't
12 Feb 15:59 - Tegan: Owen!
12 Feb 16:15 - Sam Roberts: Can it do awesome stuff now it's rooted?
12 Feb 16:17 - Owen: I can delete apps that were locked by the OS

12 Feb 16:17 - Owen: I will look into giving it a whole new look as well
12 Feb 16:18 - Sam Roberts: Ah fuck, how easy was it?

12 Feb 18:05 - Henry Dranks: congratulations joeee!
12 Feb 18:05 - Henry Dranks: Did it work owen?
12 Feb 18:33 - Owen: Nah it was too much effort keeping track of everything. It also became a bit distracting because kids would argue for xp.
12 Feb 18:33 - Owen: This looks like it will remove those problems.
12 Feb 19:23 - Bongo: Cool pic, I can forgive it even though it's in paradise
12 Feb 19:23 - Bongo: I might have to lead this group when everyone whips out the carnival pics
12 Feb 19:24 - Owen: Congratulations Joe!!!

12 Feb 20:27 - Joe Jarman: Obviously I didnt
12 Feb 20:32 - Vanessa: I know a couple who actually made up their last name
12 Feb 20:32 - Vanessa: I thought that was pretty original
12 Feb 20:34 - Shaggy: Did they randomly put their names together with a hyphen in between?
12 Feb 20:34 - Vanessa: Nope they actually made a new name using their old names as guidance
12 Feb 20:34 - Vanessa: Gordan and Leech to make Leedon
12 Feb 20:35 - Vanessa: Her husband's mother was not too pleased
12 Feb 20:35 - Shaggy: Anagram contest!

12 Feb 20:39 - Shaggy: Dong is good too
12 Feb 20:39 - Shaggy: Omg, it can be Horde
12 Feb 20:39 - Shaggy: They missed out
12 Feb 20:40 - Shaggy: If I was her husband's mother I would be unhappy too
12 Feb 20:45 - Vanessa: Why? Because they should have gone with Horde?
12 Feb 21:45 - Owen: Bomes or Jott would be ours
13 Feb 01:51 - Tegan: Obvs you should both have taken Liza's name

17 Feb 13:12 - Tegan: Let us know what you neeeed

17 Feb 15:04 - Tegan: Roger on the ricotta etc
17 Feb 15:17 - Adam Wills: Just came back to Bangalore from Kashmir... FYI for all snowboarders - Go to gulmarg in Kashmir for a once in a lifetime snowboarding experience... I would be so up for doing that again (sewing a little seed for next season - Feb is the time to do it)
17 Feb 15:17 - Adam Wills: But seriously can you do pancakes again next week??
17 Feb 15:18 - Shaggy: We can definitely have more pancakes, what kind of question is that?

17 Feb 18:46 - Martha: Me + teegs + Lorna + shaggy + bongo = 5+...
17 Feb 18:48 - Shaggy: Vinay. Angie made a noise earlier

17 Feb 18:49 - Angela: Is there free parking near yours? Feeling lazy
17 Feb 18:49 - Angela: And what can I bring?
17 Feb 18:53 - Tegan: My only request is lemons
17 Feb 18:53 - Angela: All my trains to elephant are cancelled! What treachery is this!
17 Feb 18:54 - Shaggy: There is but I suspect not free, I will be home shortly and check
17 Feb 18:56 - Angela: Cool thanks, trains are all cancelled til 7.40 and then it says bulletin on the service, whatever that means
17 Feb 19:03 - Shaggy: Yup you can park downstairs
17 Feb 19:04 - Angela: Woohoo! I'll be there in about 30 then, with lemons!
17 Feb 19:11 - Tegan: If anyone is with Dave, could you tell him I plan to leave his key in the gas lockers? Or find out if he had the spares?

17 Feb 19:22 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: Dave has the spares

17 Feb 19:29 - Lorna: Passed him. I'm outside
17 Feb 23:04 - Tegan: Sooooo pancaked

18 Feb 10:37 - Shaggy: Matt Berry: Wildlove
18 Feb 11:44 - Tegan: Research confirms there is no such thing as a carpet pigeon. .. so what was that funky bird?
18 Feb 11:59 - Hannah Murphy: WHAT THE FUCK WAS THAT
18 Feb 18:42 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: Man its really weird to feel cold again

18 Feb 18:54 - Sam Roberts: It's nice being back in England in all its drizzly glory
18 Feb 18:55 - Sam Roberts: Well jealous of the pancake chat
18 Feb 19:35 - Bongo: We'll probs have another one next week
18 Feb 19:36 - Bongo: It's a little known fact that there was a second, more popular Saint of pancakes who's favourite topping was beer
18 Feb 19:36 - Bongo: His day is next week
18 Feb 19:39 - Sam Roberts: Ah, the festival of St Beercakes, how could I forget?
18 Feb 19:42 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: He drove all the teetotallers out of Ireland
18 Feb 22:26 - Tegan: Yo, Dave's heading over in the AM to collect his bizniz from C town- he should be there for 8.30
18 Feb 22:27 - Tegan: Can someone let him in?
18 Feb 22:39 - Sam Roberts: Lemme check with Ferenc, else might have to be a smidge earlier

18 Feb 22:45 - Sam Roberts: His number's just coming, if he doesn't answer just give him a call
18 Feb 22:46 - Sam Roberts: One of us will probably be around anyway, swearing about having to leave the house
18 Feb 22:46 - Sam Roberts: Ferenc Fernando.vcf (file attached)
19 Feb 07:31 - Tegan: Dave's phone is bezonked, so he won't be able to phone anyone
19 Feb 07:32 - Tegan: But he is on his way eta 8.25

20 Feb 00:01 - Bongo: "Sometimes people write novels and they just be so wordy and self-absorbed. I am not a fan of books. I would never want a book's autograph. I am a proud non-reader of books" - actual quote of Kanye west
20 Feb 07:56 - Tegan: Books can be wordy

20 Feb 18:42 - Lorna: Not sensing much enthusiasm for drinking tonight...
20 Feb 18:43 - Tegan: Everyone else is lame
20 Feb 18:43 - Tegan: Come boogying!
20 Feb 18:46 - Lorna: Where're you going to be? And when?
20 Feb 18:47 - Tegan: Do you fancy dinner at ours?  I'm around kx now having a beer but we probably don't want to go out til later

20 Feb 23:07 - Dave: What time?

20 Feb 23:11 - Owen: So we will be in London from 10/11ish
20 Feb 23:13 - Dave: In the morning I assume
20 Feb 23:13 - Owen: Yeah
20 Feb 23:13 - Owen: 6:30am
20 Feb 23:13 - Owen: But if we stay home we will just sleep and that will fuck me up for work
20 Feb 23:14 - Krizia: Ahhhhh mexxiiico!  ‚ù§üòçüòçüòç
20 Feb 23:14 - Dave: K - my parents may be down but if not then maybe
20 Feb 23:14 - Krizia: It's it amazing or wwhhhaaaaattttt? ??
20 Feb 23:14 - Krizia: Say Hi to Phil!
20 Feb 23:15 - Krizia: Pretty though to stay awake!!
20 Feb 23:18 - Owen: Phil says hi too
20 Feb 23:19 - Owen: Chinese new year in London is one of the simultaneously best and worst things ever
20 Feb 23:19 - Owen: Its like watching a movie that's so bad it's good.
20 Feb 23:45 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: Hey that new breaking bad show has started!
20 Feb 23:45 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: Better call Saul... Has anyone watched it?
21 Feb 00:00 - Bongo: Yep
21 Feb 00:00 - Bongo: Pretty good
21 Feb 00:00 - Bongo: Not nearly as good as breaking bad
21 Feb 10:12 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: Yeah it's not bad so far
21 Feb 10:12 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: Less funny madcaps than I was expecting
21 Feb 11:20 - Pete Morey: I like it,  s'good...  Basically pre-bb Saul is pre cancer Walt
21 Feb 11:21 - Pete Morey: Same premise + arc,  but it's a good one so worth repeating
21 Feb 11:23 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: I dunno, slip and fall Saul?
21 Feb 11:24 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: He's pretty devious from the start
21 Feb 12:02 - Pete Morey: Yeah true
21 Feb 12:03 - Pete Morey: Slippin Jimmy
21 Feb 12:04 - Pete Morey: I'm shutting up about it now, in case spoilers etc
21 Feb 12:06 - Pete Morey: Random pc question for anyone who might be able to help:
21 Feb 12:09 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: Turn it off and on again
21 Feb 12:11 - Pete Morey: I just bought pc and ssd - I wanna put the os on the ssd but it has come pre loaded on the hdd. No installation disk and any legit online source for installation is an 'update' rather than original install.  Anywhere I can get a windows 8 installation?  Any other suggestions about how to proceed??
21 Feb 12:11 - Pete Morey: Sorry:I tried bashing with a rock already
21 Feb 12:17 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: Are you sure you want windows 8?
21 Feb 12:17 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: I've heard it's weird
21 Feb 12:18 - Pete Morey: Yeah it's weird... Too late now I got it
21 Feb 12:19 - Pete Morey: It tries to turn windows into an app system or smt
21 Feb 12:20 - Pete Morey: It's my cheapest option cos I got a product key with the pc
21 Feb 12:22 - Sam Roberts: We've got a Windows 7 bit usb with a crack somewhere, can use that
21 Feb 12:23 - Sam Roberts: If you're on 8, get the 8.1 update and you can run a proper desktop. All the panel stuff is weak unless you're using it as a touch screen
21 Feb 12:23 - Pete Morey: Yeah?
21 Feb 12:23 - Pete Morey: Or maybe I could transfer 7 from my old laptop
21 Feb 12:23 - Pete Morey: I'm checking that out now
21 Feb 12:24 - Pete Morey: How do I get the 7 windows of ye Sam?
21 Feb 12:28 - Pete Morey: Oh yeah I have 8.1 sorry yeah
21 Feb 12:32 - Sam Roberts: I've got to do mine sometime, Windows party Monday night?
21 Feb 12:34 - Pete Morey: Haha sounds fun.  I might have a solution from my housemate by then,  but YES in principle.  How does a windows party work then?
21 Feb 12:38 - Sam Roberts: You come round about 8, we celebrate everything Windows
21 Feb 12:38 - Sam Roberts: Looking out of them, opening, closing, the LOT
21 Feb 12:39 - Pete Morey: .. Maybe we could put our pc s together in a room/pit and encourage them to kiss
21 Feb 12:39 - Pete Morey: ... And/or fight...
21 Feb 12:40 - Pete Morey: We could take bets
21 Feb 12:40 - Pete Morey: On outcomes etc
21 Feb 12:41 - Pete Morey: Godammit this isn't helping with my OS/Ssd problem at all...
21 Feb 12:43 - Pete Morey: (it takes me two hours to get to canning town btw.  We'd best have the windows party at a decent mid point.  Or mine.)
21 Feb 12:47 - Sam Roberts: <Media omitted>
21 Feb 12:48 - Pete Morey: <Media omitted>
21 Feb 12:49 - Bongo: For some reason I read that as visual communication helps thinking
21 Feb 12:49 - Pete Morey: It does!
21 Feb 12:51 - Pete Morey: .. But maybe not when trying to plan a windows party w sam
21 Feb 12:51 - Pete Morey: Especially in negotiating a venue that isn't Sam's place...
21 Feb 12:57 - Bongo: Yea that sucks just go with 7
21 Feb 13:29 - Shaggy: Sam I think mentioned about some utility that moves windows over? Did you try it last time you messed with your PC? Clean install would be best anyways, your PC probably comes with a bunch of preinstalled bullshit anyway. How big is the ssd?
21 Feb 13:42 - Pete Morey: Oh hey.  Yeah ideally I want clean install but my pc didn't come with install disk
21 Feb 13:43 - Pete Morey: So I got the product key from the pc and am looking for a standard install iso online
21 Feb 13:43 - Pete Morey: Actually,  I would prefer a USB install
21 Feb 13:44 - Pete Morey: Cos I don't have did drive
21 Feb 13:44 - Shaggy: You need to pirate that shit, you won't find one to download
21 Feb 13:44 - Pete Morey: The ssd is 120gigs
21 Feb 13:44 - Shaggy: Ok that's enough for windows
21 Feb 13:44 - Pete Morey: *DVD
21 Feb 13:45 - Pete Morey: Yeah I thought so.  Windows plus Adobe and office programs I hope
21 Feb 13:46 - Pete Morey: Can I not just use a standard install cd as long as I have the product key?
21 Feb 13:46 - Pete Morey: (which is downloadable)
21 Feb 13:47 - Pete Morey: (or I thought it would be)
21 Feb 13:47 - Shaggy: It's not
21 Feb 13:47 - Pete Morey: Wow that's shit
21 Feb 13:47 - Shaggy: Yup
21 Feb 13:48 - Pete Morey: Can I not just use someone else's install cd then?  No crack needed cos I have legit cd key
21 Feb 13:52 - Shaggy: Don't have windows 8, 'm afraid
21 Feb 13:54 - Pete Morey: 8.1?
21 Feb 13:54 - Shaggy: Same thing
21 Feb 13:55 - Pete Morey: Bum bum
21 Feb 13:55 - Pete Morey: What about transfer from hdd to ssd?
21 Feb 13:55 - Pete Morey: I'll go away do some research now...
21 Feb 13:57 - Dave: Take it to nerdgasm people
21 Feb 14:04 - Pete Morey: Nerdgasm?
21 Feb 14:14 - Dave: It's a dark world where discussions on computers take place
21 Feb 14:28 - Pete Morey: Oh OK.  I could join that if I wasn't immediately 'noobed'  or smt
21 Feb 14:28 - Pete Morey: 'hazed'
21 Feb 14:28 - Pete Morey: 'bummed'

21 Feb 19:54 - Alex Bunn: Did you get football pie all over your face?
21 Feb 19:56 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: Yes... and the pie in this case, was a goal

25 Feb 11:45 - Shaggy: Visio is for making diagrams not presentations
25 Feb 11:46 - Pete Morey: Presi?
25 Feb 11:46 - Shaggy: I use google docs for everything these days, it has docs, spreadsheets, presentation and diagram shit
25 Feb 11:55 - Pete Morey: Or you could pay some  chancer to make a video scribe?  (see y draw and video scribe dot com)

26 Feb 15:29 - Alex Bunn: Dayum that was good eats
26 Feb 16:34 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: I had a five guys burger for lunch and I'm still feeling drowsy now
26 Feb 16:34 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: Those things are ridiculous
26 Feb 16:54 - Alex Bunn: Mmm so good
26 Feb 17:08 - Owen: Five guys. I thought they were exclusively American.
26 Feb 17:10 - Angela: Loads of people in my office were eating those for lunch, even though it took them 20 mins on the bus to get there
26 Feb 17:25 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: I kind of wanted to die when I finished it

27 Feb 11:37 - Alex Bunn: Donuts
27 Feb 11:40 - Alex Bunn: <Media omitted>
27 Feb 12:15 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: <Media omitted>
27 Feb 12:15 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: White and gold, or blue and black?
27 Feb 12:15 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: http://gizmodo.com/what-the-fuck-is-wrong-with-your-eyes-a-dress-explaine-1688364883
27 Feb 12:16 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: Fucking weird, loads of people at work see it as white and gold üò¶
27 Feb 12:23 - Alex Bunn: Depends on the photo
27 Feb 12:23 - Alex Bunn: And the camera exposure
27 Feb 12:28 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: Unless you think it has a blue filter on it, I don't know how you can see that as white
27 Feb 12:30 - Alex Bunn: Its not
27 Feb 12:30 - Alex Bunn: But iv seen other photos where its def white
27 Feb 12:32 - Krizia: White
27 Feb 12:32 - Vanessa: Yea it depends which phone you're looking at
27 Feb 12:33 - Vanessa: I've seen it both
27 Feb 12:33 - Krizia: <Media omitted>
27 Feb 12:34 - Krizia: That's from my mexi friends
27 Feb 12:34 - Krizia: It says I saw it blue and black and then white and gold hahahah
27 Feb 12:41 - Sam Roberts: I can see why Phil likes it over there now ;)
27 Feb 12:42 - Sam Roberts: Everyone seeing it as blue now? I got it from someone at work earlier, on the pc I could make it change by concentrating
27 Feb 12:42 - Sam Roberts: It really messed me up for ten minutes
27 Feb 12:44 - Shaggy: What? It totally white and gold
27 Feb 12:45 - Pete Morey: I'm gettin b+b
27 Feb 12:51 - Dave: Blue and black (the dress, right?)
27 Feb 12:56 - Eliza: So I saw this online, and I know the dress is blue and black and I know this isn't a weird conspiracy or practical joke. But goddamn I can't for the life of me see it as anything other than a white and gold dress in shadow.
27 Feb 12:57 - Owen: Wow!
27 Feb 12:58 - Pete Morey: Freaky...  So it's a screen thing?
27 Feb 12:58 - Owen: Does the white in shadow look at all blue to you?
27 Feb 12:58 - Sam Roberts: Not a screen thing
27 Feb 12:59 - Sam Roberts: It's a mind thing
27 Feb 12:59 - Owen: It's a colour perception thing
27 Feb 12:59 - Sam Roberts: What even are eyes?
27 Feb 12:59 - Eliza: Yes, it looks like blueish shadow. But it looks like the dress should be white (and gold) in proper lighting.
27 Feb 13:00 - Owen: What colour do the highlights on the blue look like?
27 Feb 13:00 - Owen: Also come open the door!
27 Feb 13:01 - Pete Morey: Wow
27 Feb 13:02 - Pete Morey: But the screen doesn't contribute at all??
27 Feb 13:12 - Sam Roberts: This one looks a lot more blue than on the computer. Unless I put them next to each other...
27 Feb 13:15 - Vanessa: On the left side there is a two tone clothing behind the dress, what colours do people see and is it the same as the main dress?
27 Feb 13:20 - Shaggy: <Media omitted>
27 Feb 13:24 - Pete Morey: So is it to do with colour blindness or is a more nuanced aspect of,  for eg,  complementary colour perception? (within an ordinary range)
27 Feb 13:26 - Hannah Murphy: Eyes: what are?
27 Feb 13:31 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: The one I posted is the original and there are a lot of people who see white and gold even if you mess about with the brightness etc.
27 Feb 13:31 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: It's probly something to do with rods and cones in the eye
27 Feb 13:32 - Owen: Possibly people with fewer blue cones see white and gold.
27 Feb 13:34 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: <Media omitted>
27 Feb 13:37 - Owen: The dress is the same blue in both examples.
27 Feb 13:45 - Alex Bunn: Just went back to the photo. Its changed colour
27 Feb 13:46 - Sam Roberts: I read a thing saying it's not in the eye ie rods and cones, apparently there's a massive range of proportions naturally that has almost no impact on colour perception
27 Feb 13:46 - Sam Roberts: I call Kant
27 Feb 13:48 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: This is like the biggest thing on the internet in a long time üò¶
27 Feb 13:48 - Vanessa: I think this is basically an experiment to prove the point that nobody sees things the same way
27 Feb 13:54 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: I don't think it was an experiment, someone just posted the picture on Facebook and it's completely exploded
27 Feb 14:12 - Sam Roberts: Everyone going to this comedy tonight? Where is it?
27 Feb 14:22 - Pete Morey: <Media omitted>
27 Feb 14:22 - Pete Morey: Hey its near where I'm working on this animation project :)
27 Feb 14:23 - Pete Morey: It's called schadenfreude cabaret

27 Feb 15:16 - Dave: I'm aimimg to be there. Got work drinks but ahould be able to do both
27 Feb 16:43 - Vanessa: What time are people heading there?

1 Mar 17:39 - Alex Bunn: I was gonna cycle home after the rugby and it's absolutely pissing it down now ‚òîÔ∏è‚òîÔ∏èüò≠üò≠
1 Mar 17:41 - Shaggy: It's pissing cars and dogs
1 Mar 20:30 - Owen: Ok i just found out that netflix has all the GOOD classic godzilla movies on it. Except rodan.

1 Mar 23:24 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: <Media omitted>
2 Mar 00:18 - Alex Bunn: Lol
2 Mar 07:23 - Owen: Mike you have lost the plot. Why wouldn't you want to watch a three headed space lizard fight a radioactive earth lizard?
2 Mar 07:32 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: I watched Godzilla vs Mothra recently
2 Mar 07:33 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: It's like watching power rangers when they get all big
2 Mar 07:44 - Sam Roberts: That was always the best bit of power rangers
2 Mar 07:45 - Sam Roberts: The only point of that show was to teach kids good things happen if you wait
2 Mar 07:46 - Eliza: I'm thinking Power Rangers marathon, anyone else?
2 Mar 07:54 - Shaggy: Hella no. I made a mistake of watching it again when I was 16, I was bitterly disappointed
2 Mar 07:54 - Sam Roberts: You probably didn't have costumes and themed food though
2 Mar 08:09 - Owen: That show was hella racist!
2 Mar 08:09 - Owen: The yellow ranger was chinese and the black ranger was black.
2 Mar 08:13 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: I think you'll find they were blue and white owen
2 Mar 08:30 - Eliza: Wait, wasn't there also a white power ranger?! A WHITE POWER ranger?
2 Mar 08:39 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: Yo guys, I made this last night, I think it's quite fun, The Horde over time in one image : http://uppix.com/f-big_file54f421020018708d.png

2 Mar 09:46 - Tegan: Word of the tech event so far: softwarization
2 Mar 10:09 - Owen: Nice work mike.
2 Mar 10:09 - Owen: I love that godzilla was the biggest word last may!
2 Mar 10:09 - Owen: I must have really be looking forward to that film
2 Mar 10:09 - Hannah Murphy: Hahahaj we were certainly rowdy in November:
2 Mar 10:09 - Owen: Been*
2 Mar 10:09 - Hannah Murphy: Lads lads shots girls
2 Mar 10:10 - Owen: I also like the progression from beers to shots as winter progresses
2 Mar 10:10 - Hannah Murphy: Oh yeah jan 2k14 when I posed the important "would you rather have teeth for pubes or pubes for teeth" question
2 Mar 10:11 - Hannah Murphy: Ah sweet memories
2 Mar 10:11 - Alex Bunn: Lol good times!
2 Mar 10:11 - Alex Bunn: I forgot about that one!
2 Mar 11:18 - Bongo: Lol that's awesome mike, is it really a frequency thing? Cus some of those don't sound like stuff we'd say a lot
2 Mar 11:18 - Bongo: Like "didn realise" unless that typo has been made a lot
2 Mar 11:38 - Vanessa: That's pretty cool
2 Mar 11:46 - Shaggy: Vanessa is not impressed

2 Mar 12:33 - Alex Bunn: You're on their a lot dude!
2 Mar 12:33 - Alex Bunn: There*
2 Mar 12:33 - Alex Bunn: eurgh
2 Mar 12:37 - Owen: I seem to always come in pairs as does sam. Any ideas why mike?
2 Mar 12:53 - Hannah Murphy: Bad news for the ladies:
2 Mar 12:54 - Hannah Murphy: <Media omitted>
2 Mar 12:54 - Pete Morey: Wow!
2 Mar 12:55 - Pete Morey: The Christian far right has been reading the profanisaurus
2 Mar 12:55 - Pete Morey: Or at least Viz
2 Mar 13:02 - Owen: @mike. Phil thanks you and Phil asks if you going to do individual word clouds over time as well.
2 Mar 13:02 - Alex Bunn: Lol. Save your soul, dont touch your hole!
2 Mar 13:06 - Hannah Murphy: The clitoris is the devil's doorbell!! If ya ring it he will answer
2 Mar 13:06 - Angela: Wow god is really micromanaging these days
2 Mar 13:07 - Hannah Murphy: But men - apparently you shouldn't touch you 'sin stick' either
2 Mar 13:18 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: Lol
2 Mar 13:20 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: My methodology was pretty careless, so there'll be lots of weird stuff there
2 Mar 13:21 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: Its based on relative frequency of words in each month, I'm trying to do it for all reddit comments, I'll redo it if I can be bothered to iron out the weirdness
2 Mar 13:23 - Alex Bunn: Reddit comments??
2 Mar 13:25 - Owen: ALL reddit comments?
2 Mar 13:25 - Owen: Thats some seriously big data!
2 Mar 14:05 - Pete Morey: http://viz.co.uk/rogers-profanisaurus-deansgate-tornado/
2 Mar 14:06 - Pete Morey: I couldn't find devil's doorbell on the online one,  but I know it's there somewhere....
2 Mar 14:07 - Pete Morey: ...  Cue extended jokes about finding the devil's doorbell:
2 Mar 14:10 - Sam Roberts: Redtube
2 Mar 17:29 - Alex Bunn: This isnt google Sam
2 Mar 18:28 - Bongo: I like to think of it as a salvation pillar rather than a sin stick
2 Mar 18:29 - Shaggy: I like to think of  it as a sin log
2 Mar 19:29 - Pete Morey: http://viz.co.uk/rogers-profanisaurus-the-elephant/
2 Mar 22:48 - Shaggy: Right gang table booked for tomorrow for 7:30pm http://www.sushicafe.co.uk/
2 Mar 22:48 - Bongo: Whoever can fit 30 sushi rolls in their mouth at once doesn't have to pick up the bill
2 Mar 22:51 - Krizia: Bring it on!!! :p
3 Mar 07:54 - Sam Roberts: Something something practice  *dirty grin*
3 Mar 07:55 - Shaggy: Something something something...you wish
3 Mar 11:17 - Owen: <Media omitted>
3 Mar 11:28 - Alex Bunn: Lol
3 Mar 11:28 - Alex Bunn: I wish hivernation was socially acceptable
3 Mar 11:31 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: Lol, I saw a bear comic today
3 Mar 11:32 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: <Media omitted>
3 Mar 11:33 - Shaggy: Haha
3 Mar 12:43 - Owen: <Media omitted>
3 Mar 12:51 - Tegan: Sweet thing O
3 Mar 12:52 - Tegan: Looks like the 9 sided dive in a futuristic rpg to me
3 Mar 12:52 - Tegan: Die
3 Mar 12:52 - Tegan: Dice
3 Mar 12:55 - Owen: Its actually a d6
3 Mar 12:58 - Tegan: There you go then
3 Mar 12:58 - Tegan: Could go to 9 though couldn't it
3 Mar 12:58 - Tegan: If you applied yourself
3 Mar 13:09 - Owen: Yeah. There are three variables that set max, min, and spins.
3 Mar 14:30 - Sam Roberts: So you can have a 3 sided die
3 Mar 14:30 - Sam Roberts: ?
3 Mar 14:40 - Shaggy: Which basically a 6 sided die with any two numbers for the three options
3 Mar 15:36 - Owen: I can
3 Mar 15:38 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: Or get a 3 sided dreidel!
3 Mar 15:38 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: #notjewish
3 Mar 16:40 - Owen: Are there any regular 3 sided 3D shapes?
3 Mar 16:40 - Owen: With flat plane surfaces?
3 Mar 16:40 - Owen: What about irregular?
3 Mar 16:43 - Shaggy: Cylinder is 3 sided
3 Mar 16:44 - Dave: üëè
3 Mar 16:44 - Owen: Nice
3 Mar 16:46 - Shaggy: I'm guessing it should be possible to design it so that it's equally likely to land any side up?
3 Mar 17:23 - Owen: Well a massive curved face will be landed on way more often than 1/3. A really thin curved face (like a coin) will almost never be landed on. So somewhere in between must be a size of face which is landed on 1/3rd of the time.

12 Mar 09:23 - Lorna: People of the horde: does anyone want to watch inherent vice at prince Charles cinema tonight? Or play some pool? I want to do one of those things tonight.
12 Mar 10:12 - Joe Jarman: Bongo can I have your mouse outfit ticket?
12 Mar 10:20 - Joe Jarman: New album is up on spotify üëç

12 Mar 10:26 - Joe Jarman: Gash
12 Mar 10:28 - Joe Jarman: How much is it
12 Mar 10:28 - Shaggy: 20 I think
12 Mar 10:29 - Joe Jarman: Ok I'll just buy one then, easy
12 Mar 10:31 - Dave: When's the gig? (And why was it not announced on gigs and giggles - you know the rules)
12 Mar 10:38 - Joe Jarman: Yeah I know I've just been searching for mouse on whatsapp everywhere and no hits!!

12 Mar 10:46 - Dave: I'm in leeds
12 Mar 11:13 - Pete Morey: <Media omitted>
12 Mar 11:21 - Owen: I am ashamed but I had to google non sequitur
12 Mar 11:22 - Owen: It's one of those words I understand when it is used but didn't know the definition of.
12 Mar 11:26 - Pete Morey: But is it 'non seck-wit-terrrr'  or 'non seckwitter'?
12 Mar 12:20 - Jimena: Why be ashamed? In some circles i know 'knowlege' of that sort is just another accessory people flaunt to raise themselves above others
12 Mar 12:21 - Jimena: Fuck the pretentiousness. The important things in life can be understood and discussed in simple words.
12 Mar 12:27 - Jimena: Of course i love words. And choosing the best one. But they are just the clothes that dress our ideas.
12 Mar 12:27 - Jimena: But thats just me ranting. So what DOES non sequitur mean üòÅ
12 Mar 12:43 - Pete Morey: It means 'random non related thing in sequence',  unconnected thing etc etc
12 Mar 12:43 - Pete Morey: It's a roof made of owls...
12 Mar 12:55 - Jimena: Ah like the 2 penguins are in the shower and one drops the soap joke
12 Mar 12:57 - Jimena: And then other penguin looks at him and says... "What do you think i am?! A shoe?!"
12 Mar 13:08 - Pete Morey: Yeah zackly
12 Mar 13:09 - Pete Morey: ...  Wait I don't geddit :p
12 Mar 13:10 - Pete Morey: ...  You know there's a no fly zone in Antarctica where loads of penguins live
12 Mar 13:10 - Pete Morey: ...  They kept looking up to see the planes,  following them with their heads and then falling on their backs
12 Mar 13:11 - Pete Morey: ...  Apparently penguins can't get up
12 Mar 13:11 - Pete Morey: So if your one picked up the soap he'd probably die
12 Mar 13:11 - Pete Morey: After being buggered
12 Mar 13:12 - Pete Morey: ....  So what's black and white and clean and red all over?
12 Mar 13:19 - Shaggy: That's the dumbest thing I've heard
12 Mar 13:20 - Shaggy: Penguins fall over all the time, they are clumsier than pandas
12 Mar 13:24 - Pete Morey: Wha?!  No way!!  -  pandas fall out of TREES.
12 Mar 13:25 - Shaggy: That's because trees are tricker than just standing on flat ground, believe it or not
12 Mar 13:26 - Pete Morey: And they're nearly extinct,  cos the male panda can't coordinate his winky into the fu-fu
12 Mar 13:26 - Shaggy: No man can do that
12 Mar 13:26 - Pete Morey: I bet penguins could
12 Mar 13:28 - Pete Morey: ..  Ask the one who picked up the soap
12 Mar 14:33 - Jimena: Fu-fu? Really? That's a new one for me
12 Mar 14:35 - Jimena: And i've heard it called a bunch of things: chichino, punani, mushy and the ever so crude 'beefcurtains' among others
12 Mar 14:38 - Jimena: Also how does picking up the soap equal falling over? Can they not pick things up either? Cause i cant fathom how a being that cant get up or pick up soap like things survives
12 Mar 14:40 - Tegan: I bet they could pick up the soap underwater
12 Mar 14:41 - Tegan: Maybe a creature more suited to baths...
12 Mar 15:25 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: Aw, Terry Pratchett
12 Mar 15:25 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: That sucks
12 Mar 15:52 - Tegan: That is sad
12 Mar 15:52 - Tegan: Only 66... But he's looked about 150 forever...
12 Mar 16:09 - Sam Roberts: Great books, Great man
12 Mar 16:13 - Jimena: Noooooo

12 Mar 20:22 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: In good news, Bill Watterson released his first book in like 15 years today!
12 Mar 20:22 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: <Media omitted>
12 Mar 20:38 - Bongo: No way!
12 Mar 20:38 - Bongo: That front cover looks suspiciously like one of his other ones though
12 Mar 21:01 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: It's not exactly a new anthology, more a retrospective
12 Mar 21:01 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: Only like ¬£10 on Amazon
12 Mar 21:02 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: Also the new mouse outfit album was awesome, bring on Saturday!
13 Mar 08:18 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: Don't forget Mother's day
13 Mar 08:51 - Shaggy: Your mother asked me to remind you, but looks like you're a good boy
13 Mar 09:11 - Mike Joyce: I actually forgot. ..i am terrible! !
13 Mar 09:14 - Dave: I made a scary card for my mum. She'll be so proud
13 Mar 09:30 - Joe Jarman: You can still make it if you post today!!!
13 Mar 10:22 - Pete Morey: Shit!
13 Mar 11:04 - Owen: A horse walks into a bar. The bartender asks the horse if it's an alcoholic considering all the bars he frequents, to which the horse replies "I don't think I am." POOF! The horse disappears. 

This is the point in time when all the philosophy students in the audience begin to giggle, as they are familiar with the philosophical proposition of Cogito ergo sum, or I think, therefore, I am.

But to explain the concept aforehand would be putting Descartes before the horse.
13 Mar 11:14 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: There was a really old askreddit thread about a guy who was genuinely in the same philosophy class as a porn star. Someone made a comment about not putting Descartes before the whores
13 Mar 11:15 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: It was the best reddit comment of all time
13 Mar 11:38 - Tegan: Right place right time, I guess
13 Mar 11:38 - Tegan: You can't plan for that shiz
13 Mar 19:08 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: Wooooo

13 Mar 19:50 - Tegan: By woodpecker
13 Mar 19:50 - Tegan: <Media omitted>
13 Mar 19:52 - Vinay: That is an amazing picture
13 Mar 19:53 - Tegan: It is one of the best things that had ever happened
13 Mar 19:54 - Tegan: Although apparently the baby critter is not trying to whimsically travel aboard the woodpecker, but to maim and kill it
13 Mar 19:54 - Vinay: I don't know the rodent / mammal that's on the bird
13 Mar 20:04 - Tegan: Internet says it's a weasel
13 Mar 20:04 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: Lol I was gona post that one
13 Mar 20:04 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: Woodpecker lived apparently
13 Mar 20:06 - Shaggy: It did live, I watched the interview with the guy that filmed it
13 Mar 20:06 - Shaggy: Or took a picture anyway
13 Mar 20:08 - Tegan: I watched an interview with the woodpecker
13 Mar 20:08 - Tegan: He was like, woooooaaaaah
13 Mar 20:09 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: The woodpecker?
13 Mar 20:09 - Shaggy: The weasel
13 Mar 20:11 - Vinay: Haha I thought you were going to say the same thing too, interview with the woodpecker
13 Mar 20:11 - Bongo: I wonder how many jokes have been made about riding a woodpecker after that picture was taken
13 Mar 20:13 - Vinay: http://cdn-test.healthunlocked.com/misc/sadie-breakfast-2015-03-13.gif

16 Mar 21:36 - Pete Morey: Imagine it being applied to warlords and dictators...
16 Mar 21:37 - Pete Morey: ... Or Republicans
16 Mar 21:38 - Pete Morey: 'another smelly poo has been voted in to the White house.'

20 Mar 09:36 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: Massive disappointment
20 Mar 09:37 - Krizia: Hahahahah nahhh a friend send that to me, nobody could see anything apparently. I missed it!
20 Mar 09:42 - Tegan: It's right now, I think
20 Mar 09:43 - Tegan: Main result is that it seems like a really shitty day
20 Mar 09:46 - Shaggy: It's on for another hour
20 Mar 09:46 - Shaggy: Looks no different to most other mornings
20 Mar 09:47 - Tegan: At least we won't go blind :)

20 Mar 09:48 - Shaggy: So shall we get tickets to the spring fest?

20 Mar 09:49 - Tegan: Sell it to me!
20 Mar 09:50 - Henry Dranks: What this eclipse has taught me is that cloudy days are much darker than I thought
20 Mar 09:50 - Henry Dranks: For this to not seem that dark

20 Mar 10:19 - Tegan: Beer
20 Mar 10:20 - Mike Joyce: I always drink bet on the pave....costs allot because i lose
20 Mar 10:22 - Tegan: Well exactly
20 Mar 10:22 - Tegan: But why pave extra for the pave to drink the costly bet?
20 Mar 10:22 - Tegan: That's what I'm asking
20 Mar 10:24 - Mike Joyce: I see your point but its all about the thrill of coins on concrete
20 Mar 10:24 - Shaggy: Beerfest to a pub is like a pub to a home.
20 Mar 10:25 - Tegan: Good start...
20 Mar 10:25 - Mike Joyce: Essential?

20 Mar 17:51 - Tegan: By which time bankers week likely to more of an issue than sunlight
20 Mar 17:51 - Tegan: Or at least, a more addressable issue
20 Mar 17:54 - Mike Joyce: How do you adress banker. ...sir or madam?    Crown and shuttle looks good but could that getting busy. Could head there. 40 mins is fine for me
20 Mar 17:55 - Mike Joyce: Everything descent will be busy anyway so no point worrying.

21 Mar 10:48 - Tegan: Does anyone want to read Development as Freedom with us? We're planning a wee reading group
21 Mar 10:57 - Angela: I will!
21 Mar 11:01 - Angela: Not sure I can keep up with you though teegs, when are you reading it by?
21 Mar 11:03 - Tegan: Hoorah!

24 Mar 15:21 - Mike Joyce: I haven't even seen game of throwns but the "explain" cartoon made me laugh. It reminds me of something shaggy would say in real life
24 Mar 16:30 - Jimena: Its the stories of the lives and (mostly) deaths of the members of different clans in a medieval type fantasy world as they prepare for winter to come where winter lasts for years and years and brings with it deadly monsters and their ever growing army of undead.
24 Mar 16:32 - Jimena: And there's 3 dragons but they are kids and everyone is also waiting for them to grow and multiply.
24 Mar 16:32 - Mike Joyce: Sounds just like where i grew up

24 Mar 16:47 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: Apparently he lives in London as well, you should meet up!
24 Mar 16:48 - Krizia: Nooooo he is not that handsome as Sam!!!
24 Mar 16:48 - Krizia: üòçüòçüòçüòç
24 Mar 16:48 - Pete Morey: He certainly takes your breath away...
24 Mar 16:50 - Owen: He looks less like sam in that second photo and more like a young Robert deniro
24 Mar 16:53 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: <Media omitted>
24 Mar 17:08 - Sam Roberts: Too old
24 Mar 17:08 - Alex Bunn: Are you stalking him now Mike?
24 Mar 17:12 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: Any distraction will do today
24 Mar 17:13 - Mike Joyce: Definite love child
24 Mar 17:16 - Tegan: That was also my conclusion
24 Mar 17:16 - Tegan: Who is this lovechild and why do you have so many candid snaps of him?
24 Mar 17:17 - Sam Roberts: Cheers for clearing it up though, I spent ages trying to remember when I took that first one!
24 Mar 17:31 - Jimena: As someone who hasn't seen Sam in 7 years, the selfies made me think he wasn't aging so well üòÅ
24 Mar 17:43 - Mike Joyce: Ha ha
24 Mar 17:45 - Mike Joyce: Samad (Sam and Ahmad's love child) would be sadened by your comments

25 Mar 12:18 - Vanessa: Are they trying to do a world record on how many movies they can make on the same story?
25 Mar 12:19 - Alex Bunn: Fast and furious 6 was actually really good
25 Mar 12:19 - Alex Bunn: TIL there's a sharknado 3 and possibly a sharknado 4
25 Mar 12:24 - Vanessa: I don't even know what sharknado is
25 Mar 12:25 - Alex Bunn: Can you make a guess?
25 Mar 12:30 - Vanessa: I've just googled
25 Mar 12:30 - Vanessa: Seriously?! And it's 82% on rotten tomato
25 Mar 12:32 - Joe Jarman: I can't believe you had to google that to work out what it was about
25 Mar 12:32 - Joe Jarman: The title sharknado... Nuff said!!!!
25 Mar 12:36 - Joe Jarman: Whatsapp call feature is now working
25 Mar 12:45 - Tegan: It's just a cam through your carrier though
25 Mar 12:45 - Tegan: Call
25 Mar 12:45 - Tegan: Not over the Internet
25 Mar 12:49 - Joe Jarman: It's over the internet
25 Mar 12:49 - Joe Jarman: Not through your carrier
25 Mar 12:49 - Tegan: Must be an upgrade
25 Mar 12:50 - Joe Jarman: Yes

25 Mar 12:50 - Joe Jarman: I called you from it
25 Mar 12:50 - Tegan: Got it :)
25 Mar 12:51 - Tegan: Poor old mobile network operators
25 Mar 12:52 - Joe Jarman: Next thing to get banned left right and centre...
25 Mar 12:52 - Joe Jarman: I can't see a reason to have minutes now on my ‚òé
25 Mar 12:53 - Tegan: But skype does this
25 Mar 12:53 - Tegan: And I still use minutes
25 Mar 12:55 - Joe Jarman: Skype doesn't have your entire phonebook loaded in with everyone constantly online
25 Mar 12:56 - Joe Jarman: You have to arrange a skype generally...
25 Mar 13:59 - Alex Bunn: Furure
25 Mar 13:59 - Alex Bunn: Future*
25 Mar 13:59 - Alex Bunn: Lol
25 Mar 15:02 - Alex Bunn: Mmm just got given a free donut from a random dude in the office
25 Mar 15:02 - Alex Bunn: He was walking round with a box of krispie kremes and was just handing them out
25 Mar 15:02 - Alex Bunn: Nom

25 Mar 15:03 - Henry Dranks: Haha yea its gotta be at least 20 miles long
25 Mar 15:03 - Henry Dranks: And that jump off the tank made me piss myself laughing
25 Mar 15:04 - Alex Bunn: Now watch sharknado 3
25 Mar 15:04 - Henry Dranks: Good plan
25 Mar 15:05 - Alex Bunn: And backdoor sluts 9
25 Mar 15:06 - Henry Dranks: Ill have to watch 1-8 first
25 Mar 15:08 - Alex Bunn: You dont have to
25 Mar 15:08 - Alex Bunn: But you can if you want
25 Mar 15:09 - Henry Dranks: What about sharknado 1-2
25 Mar 15:09 - Henry Dranks: Do I need them for plot points
25 Mar 15:09 - Henry Dranks: These are all important considerations
25 Mar 15:09 - Alex Bunn: Well you survived fast and furious 6 without fast and furious tokyo drift didnt you?
25 Mar 15:10 - Henry Dranks: Nah ive seen that!
25 Mar 15:10 - Alex Bunn: Lol of course!
25 Mar 15:10 - Henry Dranks: Was terrible tho
25 Mar 15:10 - Alex Bunn: Cos it didnt have the rock
25 Mar 15:11 - Henry Dranks: Yea pretty much
25 Mar 15:11 - Henry Dranks: His eyebrow acting is amazing
25 Mar 15:12 - Alex Bunn: <Media omitted>
25 Mar 15:13 - Alex Bunn: Damn straight
25 Mar 15:39 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: Jump off the tank was one of the greatest moments in cinema history
25 Mar 15:47 - Alex Bunn: I want to rewatch that film now
25 Mar 16:04 - Sam Roberts: I'm in, haven't seen any of them since the first one
25 Mar 16:04 - Sam Roberts: I hate to miss out on high culture!
25 Mar 16:36 - Alex Bunn: Sweeet
25 Mar 19:08 - Vanessa: I wish there was an emoticon that does eye roll
25 Mar 19:10 - Alex Bunn: üò±
25 Mar 19:57 - Mike Joyce: üé•=üöΩ?
25 Mar 19:59 - Mike Joyce: Actually I did not understand these films untill I was massively hung over...then they made pefect sence
25 Mar 20:00 - Shaggy: Woo my phone decided it can charge now
25 Mar 20:01 - Shaggy: Love the fat pics, bongo looks uncanny
26 Mar 08:51 - Shaggy: "Welcome back, Shaggy!"
26 Mar 08:51 - Shaggy: "Yay! he's back!"
26 Mar 08:51 - Shaggy: Aww so nice of you guys
26 Mar 08:57 - Tegan: I missed you Shaggy
26 Mar 09:29 - Joe Jarman: üéäüòâ
26 Mar 09:43 - Alex Bunn: Back to kill the convo flow
26 Mar 09:43 - Alex Bunn: üòâ
26 Mar 09:45 - Owen: I can't believe anyone is standing up for Clarkson. You don't get to punch a coworker over a cold steak just because you are famous for being a knob.
26 Mar 09:47 - Alex Bunn: I havnt heard anyone stand up for him
26 Mar 09:48 - Dave: I might stand up to piss on his car
26 Mar 09:48 - Dave: But i could do it sitting down
26 Mar 09:51 - Joe Jarman: Over one million people have signed his petition
26 Mar 09:52 - Joe Jarman: And his dinner was cold
26 Mar 09:52 - Joe Jarman: And the nobody producer was being an ass!!
26 Mar 10:10 - Shaggy: I like how James May put it - "much as I think he's a knob I quite like working with Jeremy"
26 Mar 10:12 - Sam Roberts: I can't believe you can be employed for being an entertaining prick for so long, then get suspended for being a prick
26 Mar 10:24 - Joe Jarman: It will ruin the show and itv will pick it up and it wil be really bad news for the bbc. One of the only shows left that anyone gives a fuck about overseas
26 Mar 10:34 - Owen: Doesn't mean you should be immune.
26 Mar 10:34 - Joe Jarman: But that's the reality
26 Mar 10:35 - Owen: The bbc still own the name. They will just find some new presenters.
26 Mar 10:35 - Joe Jarman: Top gear is nothing without Clarkson
26 Mar 10:36 - Owen: Jeremy Clarkson doesn't shit gold. He is just a balding middle aged white posh man with outdated opinions. It's not like Britain doesn't have loads of them lying about.
26 Mar 10:36 - Owen: You could get Nigel Farage to host the show and I wouldn't be able to tell the difference.
26 Mar 10:40 - Alex Bunn: Get rid
26 Mar 10:40 - Alex Bunn: He's a cunt
26 Mar 10:42 - Owen: Watch "Stewart Lee and Top Gear" on YouTube - Stewart Lee and Top Gear: https://youtu.be/K7CnMQ4L9Pc
26 Mar 10:42 - Joe Jarman: Well he has gone
26 Mar 10:42 - Shaggy: Top gear is dead
26 Mar 10:42 - Alex Bunn: They should replace top gear with a nice show about electric cars
26 Mar 10:42 - Joe Jarman: And top gear is dead
26 Mar 10:42 - Owen: I think stuart lee should take over
26 Mar 10:43 - Shaggy: Stuart lee is not funny
26 Mar 10:43 - Alex Bunn: Thats the point
26 Mar 10:44 - Joe Jarman: A show about electric cars mixed with a nice dose of political correctness
26 Mar 10:45 - Alex Bunn: Yep.
26 Mar 10:47 - Owen: Stuart lee is hilarious shaggy.
26 Mar 10:47 - Owen: Watch that video i just posted.
26 Mar 10:50 - Shaggy: Watched it yesterday. Not funny
26 Mar 10:50 - Alex Bunn: I dont see shaggy liking stewart lee
26 Mar 10:50 - Henry Dranks: I hate that video
26 Mar 10:50 - Alex Bunn: You have to be a miserable englishman to get him i think
26 Mar 10:50 - Owen: Do you think Jeremy Clarkson is funny then shags?
26 Mar 10:50 - Henry Dranks: And I agree that clarksons a cunt
26 Mar 10:51 - Henry Dranks: But that lee video is unfunny and ridiculously far off the mark about top gear
26 Mar 10:51 - Henry Dranks: And every one posts it everywhere like its some heavenly takedown of top gear
26 Mar 10:51 - Henry Dranks: Its fucking not!
26 Mar 10:51 - Alex Bunn: Is it the one about the playground bully?
26 Mar 10:52 - Owen: No its the one about wishing Hammond had died in that crash. But its only a joke, you know, like on top gear.
26 Mar 10:53 - Alex Bunn: Oh i get it
26 Mar 10:53 - Alex Bunn: I get jokes
26 Mar 10:53 - Shaggy: I think clarkson is funny, on the show. I don't think he is a nice person irl and his being fired is the correct thing to do, but it still ruins the show
26 Mar 10:53 - Alex Bunn: The show was a parody of itself by now
26 Mar 10:54 - Alex Bunn: I honestly couldnt tell if it was a new one or a rerun now
26 Mar 10:54 - Alex Bunn: The same shit again and again
26 Mar 10:56 - Angela: Alan partridge should be the new presenter
26 Mar 10:56 - Shaggy: It would be a different show entirely, but I c
26 Mar 10:56 - Shaggy: Condone this
26 Mar 10:58 - Owen: I just don't get why anyone finds an ignorant old man who should know better funny. His "jokes" literally consist of asian peoples eyes are slanted and post colonial Britain has a derogatory term for that; the term "slope." You know what else has slopes? Bridges do. Oh look a bridge with an Asian person on it. Wow! Slope on a slope! Hahahahahahahaha! Slope! Slopey slope slope slop! Hahahahaha, nudge nudge wink wink, were all thinking it aren't we middle Britain. Slope. Ha! 


Well no Jeremy, I'm not thinking that. All you have done is said "there is a person on a bridge" but somehow you have managed to do so in the most casually racist way possible.
26 Mar 10:58 - Alex Bunn: Yeah Alan Partridge!
26 Mar 10:59 - Alex Bunn: Its almost the same as clarkson but we can laugh at it
26 Mar 10:59 - Owen: Yeah because its a character. Not just a racist guy.
26 Mar 11:00 - Alex Bunn: Clarkson should have made an alter ego for the show and then he wouldnt be in half as much shit
26 Mar 11:00 - Owen: Totally.
26 Mar 11:00 - Shaggy: I think old racist people a funny because they are so clueless. In juxtaposition to him you had calm and collected may, and adorable hamster.
26 Mar 11:00 - Alex Bunn: That'd be using the ol noodle
26 Mar 11:01 - Owen: Problem is that Clarkson isn't clueless.
26 Mar 11:01 - Owen: A 90 yr old granma from rotherham is funny because she is clueless.
26 Mar 11:01 - Henry Dranks: Not clueless but he is a fossil
26 Mar 11:02 - Henry Dranks: My mums bf is like him
26 Mar 11:02 - Henry Dranks: Its not cluelessness they just dint understand modern views
26 Mar 11:02 - Henry Dranks: Or why its a problem
26 Mar 11:02 - Alex Bunn: They should get a 'toad of toad hall' charcter from wind in the willows to present
26 Mar 11:02 - Owen: Clarkson is 50 something, went to private school and probably has family money from colonialism knocking about.  His views don't come from cluelessness, his view
26 Mar 11:02 - Owen: Views come from a much more insidious place.
26 Mar 11:03 - Alex Bunn: Tim nice but dim. But with cars
26 Mar 11:03 - Alex Bunn: I'd watch that
26 Mar 11:03 - Alex Bunn: For a bit
26 Mar 11:03 - Alex Bunn: Boris! Haha
26 Mar 11:04 - Alex Bunn: Keeps him away from politics
26 Mar 11:04 - Owen: Steve coogan and rob brydon would be a good combo.
26 Mar 11:04 - Alex Bunn: Oooh yeah
26 Mar 11:04 - Owen: Also i think coogan is actually really into cars
26 Mar 11:05 - Alex Bunn: And brydon clearly isnt. It'd be hilarious
26 Mar 11:05 - Owen: Yeah. And they already have great chemistry. Have you seen the trip?
26 Mar 11:06 - Alex Bunn: Yeah of course. Thats why i'm so behind this idea
26 Mar 11:06 - Owen: Does there need to be a third?
26 Mar 11:06 - Eliza: And they'd spend half the time trying to do the best clarkson impression anyway!
26 Mar 11:06 - Owen: Hahahahha
26 Mar 11:06 - Angela: Hammond isn't a hamster he's a sheep. With his head far up clarksons arse
26 Mar 11:07 - Owen: Which would allow them to keep the casual racism that has made top gear so popular
26 Mar 11:11 - Alex Bunn: I thought it was about cars? Haha
26 Mar 11:11 - Alex Bunn: Ohohohohoho
26 Mar 11:13 - Owen: Nope. Otherwise fith gear would be popular
26 Mar 11:13 - Alex Bunn: Yeah or any other car show!
26 Mar 11:13 - Alex Bunn: How about cars and....
26 Mar 11:13 - Alex Bunn: Wait for it
26 Mar 11:14 - Alex Bunn: .... Guns
26 Mar 11:14 - Alex Bunn: I'm talking fast and furious 6
26 Mar 11:14 - Alex Bunn: With the rock
26 Mar 11:14 - Alex Bunn: Yes i watched it again last night
26 Mar 11:15 - Owen: Ok its settled. The new top gear cast is: steve coogan, rob brydon and dwayne "the rock" johnson
26 Mar 11:15 - Alex Bunn: We have a winner
26 Mar 11:16 - Henry Dranks: Haha good work bunn
26 Mar 11:17 - Henry Dranks: That film was instant classic
26 Mar 11:18 - Alex Bunn: Thanks üëç
26 Mar 11:18 - Alex Bunn: How was the sharknado trilogy?
26 Mar 11:19 - Henry Dranks: I didnt get onto it my internet died :(
26 Mar 11:20 - Alex Bunn: How terrible!
26 Mar 11:20 - Henry Dranks: Truly it was the darkest of times
26 Mar 11:22 - Alex Bunn: Are you still ill?
26 Mar 11:22 - Alex Bunn: Or have you managed to go to work?
26 Mar 11:22 - Alex Bunn: Where, conveniently, the internet works
26 Mar 11:26 - Henry Dranks: Haha

26 Mar 11:28 - Henry Dranks: Yes!

26 Mar 11:33 - Owen: <Media omitted>
26 Mar 11:33 - Owen: Worst mark scheme ever!
26 Mar 11:33 - Owen: They might as well write "pupil has put the correct answer down"
26 Mar 11:35 - Henry Dranks: #teacherproblems
26 Mar 11:36 - Owen: This is a proper exam. It affects these pupil's GCSE results. And they give me this vague bullshit markscheme. #fuckAQA
26 Mar 11:36 - Henry Dranks: What was the question?
26 Mar 11:36 - Alex Bunn: Be a nice teacher and give them all their GCES
26 Mar 11:37 - Owen: It gets moderated. Otherwise i would, the mark scheme is vague enough that it wouldn't even feel unprofessional to do so.
26 Mar 11:38 - Owen: @henry: the question was "why might someone else not get the same results as you"
26 Mar 11:39 - Henry Dranks: Doesnt sound like a particularly well set question
26 Mar 11:45 - Owen: It's a crock of shit, the whole paper is!
26 Mar 11:46 - Alex Bunn: OWEN RAMPAGE
26 Mar 11:49 - Owen: The paper doesn't test the kids. It tests the teacher's understanding of game theory . So much is left up to my discretion, but thats the same accross the country. So I have to mark bearing in mind that other teachers across the country will probably be lenient because they can be and because they are probably basing their marking on the idea that other teachers will be lenient. But I have to balance that with the fact that the papers get moderated. It's a fucking nightmare, just give me a mark scheme that says: "this is right, this is wrong"
26 Mar 11:51 - Dave: Mark it zero dude
26 Mar 11:52 - Alex Bunn: Lol
26 Mar 12:16 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: '156 messages from 2 conversations'

26 Mar 12:19 - Henry Dranks: Is it a parody?
26 Mar 12:59 - Shaggy: Teachers aren't what they used to be, they want answers given on a plate to them these days
26 Mar 13:01 - Owen: On marks schemes. Yes
26 Mar 18:40 - Owen: Henry:

"The Bible clearly states that the sky is a solid dome, a "firmament," which was firm enough to separate waters above it from those below on the Earth. By Noah's time it was still solid enough to have windows in it that had to be opened to let the rain through. I think that false-Christians that spite on God's face by calling it "poetic metaphor" have given in to the godless materialists! The Bible really is literal, in the true sense of the word. The sky was a hard firmament with windows in it-and anybody who says different is a mealy-mouthed evolution-sympathizer. "

Almost certainly a  parody.
26 Mar 18:40 - Owen: Also:

"Evolutionists want to call those piddlin' changes "evolution"--which just shows that they don't even know what the term means. So we creationists have to tell them that "evolution" means apes popping out human babies. You'd think them evil-utionists'd have that straight by now."
26 Mar 18:40 - Henry Dranks: But...read the replies
26 Mar 18:40 - Owen: A parody. But a hilarious one.
26 Mar 18:40 - Henry Dranks: Its a very well done parody
26 Mar 18:40 - Owen: Oooo. There's replies. I haven't get there yet
26 Mar 18:41 - Henry Dranks: I thought it was a parody
26 Mar 18:41 - Henry Dranks: Then I read the replies
26 Mar 18:41 - Henry Dranks: And now I think it might be real
26 Mar 18:41 - Henry Dranks: I just dont know what to believe anymore :(
26 Mar 18:41 - Shaggy: Can you believe it's not butter?

26 Mar 18:43 - Henry Dranks: What would god butter even entail?
26 Mar 18:43 - Shaggy: Gutter
26 Mar 18:44 - Mike Joyce: Just apppy liberally to life form
26 Mar 18:44 - Shaggy: Intellectual gutter anyhow

26 Mar 18:45 - Mike Joyce: I always fins it most amusing that thses bloggers are using a computer
26 Mar 18:47 - Mike Joyce: The same disaplin of logical deduction goes into the design of a computer is simply applied to fossel records
26 Mar 18:47 - Shaggy: Yes. At least Amish keep it real
26 Mar 18:47 - Mike Joyce: Respect the aimish
26 Mar 18:47 - Mike Joyce: But then its like...now your pretending the modern world dosnt exist

26 Mar 18:50 - Mike Joyce: im talking in general terms
26 Mar 18:51 - Shaggy: Speaking of trolls, here's an interesting article http://www.rferl.mobi/a/how-to-guide-russian-trolling-trolls/26919999.html
26 Mar 18:53 - Mike Joyce: Holly shit
26 Mar 18:53 - Mike Joyce: Unsuprised but saddened
26 Mar 18:56 - Owen: Wow. I wonder if that happens at all in britain or America
26 Mar 18:57 - Mike Joyce: Probably. ..Certainly the latter
26 Mar 18:57 - Mike Joyce: I bet private companies
26 Mar 18:58 - Shaggy: I was wondering the same, but I think it's less likely to happen politically, at least in such a way
26 Mar 18:58 - Shaggy: I mean Fox News is pretty much that, but it's more official
26 Mar 19:00 - Mike Joyce: Yes i guess russia only really has one party of strength
26 Mar 19:01 - Mike Joyce: It would be like fox news if all democrats were gone
26 Mar 19:02 - Owen: Whelp, looks like I'm having nightmares tonight.
26 Mar 19:14 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: Tl;dr for today's Horde chat?

2 Apr 14:20 - Dave: How about 7 pigs?
2 Apr 14:20 - Alex Bunn: I lol'd
2 Apr 14:21 - Bongo: 7 is probably crossing the line
2 Apr 14:21 - Bongo: I can't stand they way they talk during debates though
2 Apr 14:22 - Bongo: They need to figure things out battle royale style
2 Apr 14:27 - Dave: That would make voting simpler
2 Apr 14:27 - Dave: If the opposition are all dead

2 Apr 18:54 - Alex Bunn: 8
2 Apr 18:54 - Alex Bunn: Maybe 9
2 Apr 18:54 - Alex Bunn: #drinking
2 Apr 19:53 - Sam Roberts: Fishing's one of the great British past times of yore, like cricket
2 Apr 19:54 - Sam Roberts: They both don't make a lot of sense until you realise that holding a beer doesn't get in the way of either
2 Apr 19:54 - Sam Roberts: Can't wait
2 Apr 19:55 - Shaggy: Cricket is a lot more boring
2 Apr 20:01 - Joe Jarman: Daaaave

2 Apr 21:00 - Hannah Murphy: Especially Ukrainians
2 Apr 21:02 - Shaggy: üòî
2 Apr 21:04 - Hannah Murphy: Ugh he is the worst
2 Apr 21:34 - Sam Roberts: I caught about five seconds of Farage talking and it made my skin crawl
2 Apr 21:34 - Sam Roberts: I'm saying it, televised debates are bad for democracy
2 Apr 21:35 - Sam Roberts: They accentuate everything bad with the system while giving no accurate information to the people that need or want it
2 Apr 21:36 - Dave: I like nicola sturgeon. Damn not being scotish
2 Apr 21:38 - Alex Bunn: Mud wrestling round next
2 Apr 21:39 - Hannah Murphy: This really reminds me of the weakest link
2 Apr 21:39 - Hannah Murphy: That presenter woman as Ann Robinson

2 Apr 21:42 - Hannah Murphy: Also when the camera pans back to the girl who asked the question, check out the moustache on the guy two seats to the left
2 Apr 21:43 - Dave: It's amazing
2 Apr 21:43 - Dave: Hope he has a question
2 Apr 22:14 - Hannah Murphy: <Media omitted>
2 Apr 22:14 - Shaggy: Wow that's impressive
2 Apr 23:23 - Owen: I wish fact checking happened in real time.
2 Apr 23:23 - Owen: That would change everything
2 Apr 23:24 - Dave: Yeah, and there was a claxon every time someone was inaccurate
2 Apr 23:24 - Dave: It would just be a constant alarm for 2 hours
2 Apr 23:24 - Joe Jarman: <Media omitted>
2 Apr 23:24 - Owen: And a dong everytime someone made a promise they couldn't keep.
2 Apr 23:25 - Owen: Oh wait that already exists.... Cameron.
2 Apr 23:31 - Dave: Milliband's performance has made me wonder abour voting labour.
2 Apr 23:31 - Dave: He couldn't stand up to the real points about past labour
2 Apr 23:32 - Dave: As in, PFI in the NHS, not the whole labour recked the economy crap
2 Apr 23:33 - Dave: The nationalists (not inc UKIP) had the strongest message for me but it's useless for an English voter
2 Apr 23:33 - Dave: Doh
2 Apr 23:36 - Dave: There endeth the bantz
2 Apr 23:52 - Dave: Turns out the aids thing wasn't a new low for farage
2 Apr 23:52 - Dave: http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/oct/10/nigel-farage-keep-hiv-positive-migrants-out-britain

3 Apr 17:36 - Vanessa: When are you going to be at ctown?
3 Apr 17:40 - Tegan: Setting off now. ..
3 Apr 17:40 - Tegan: Maybe 40 mins?
3 Apr 17:40 - Vanessa: Cool
3 Apr 17:40 - Vanessa: It's all ready to hit play
3 Apr 17:45 - Tegan: Whoop!
3 Apr 18:53 - Bongo: I've just been getting into Stewart lee
3 Apr 18:53 - Bongo: That guy is funny
3 Apr 19:11 - Shaggy: That means you're getting old
3 Apr 19:19 - Owen: No. It means he has a sense of humour that doesn't revolve around farting in a cockney accent.
3 Apr 19:29 - Bongo: He has this ridiculously long but about ukip that's hilarious
3 Apr 19:30 - Tegan: He is great at ridiculously long bits
3 Apr 19:30 - Tegan: Shaggy doesn't get it for some reason
3 Apr 19:43 - Owen: Coz shaggy only understands the humour of long russian winters; not long british rants.
3 Apr 19:43 - Alex Bunn: Yeah i think thats it
3 Apr 19:45 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: He does less protracted rants now to be fair
3 Apr 19:45 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: I was never really that into them
3 Apr 19:53 - Owen: I love him. He is the kind of funny i wish i could be. Silly and dry at the same time is so hard to pull of.
3 Apr 19:53 - Owen: Off*
3 Apr 19:54 - Tegan: Theatre, innit
3 Apr 19:54 - Owen: Down by the corn exchange.
3 Apr 19:54 - Tegan: Right
3 Apr 20:06 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: I like him a lot, but I've always thought his repetition comedy was weak
3 Apr 20:07 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: Like the one where he's talking about the taxi driver who says you'll get locked in prison for saying you're english
3 Apr 20:07 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: It doesn't make me laugh
3 Apr 20:07 - Tegan: It goes through being weak into being funny again
3 Apr 20:08 - Tegan: That's the joy
3 Apr 20:08 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: But it's kind of cheap, you know?
3 Apr 20:09 - Tegan: After reading that book I feel like he's just messing with people
3 Apr 20:10 - Tegan: I can understand why you wouldn't enjoy it
3 Apr 20:10 - Alex Bunn: Shouldnt you be drunk mike?
3 Apr 20:11 - Alex Bunn: Get back to drinking! üçª
3 Apr 20:48 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: <Media omitted>
3 Apr 21:26 - Bongo: Good Viking look shags
3 Apr 21:50 - Vanessa: What's the singers name in Nickelback?
3 Apr 21:53 - Shaggy: Bongo
3 Apr 23:15 - Joe Jarman: Chad Kroeger
3 Apr 23:15 - Joe Jarman: Or something
3 Apr 23:17 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: Adolf Hitler I think
4 Apr 09:31 - Shaggy: My problem with Stewart lee is that his humour is just really drawn out. He says something remotely funny and then clings to it for half an hour, I find it tedious. He is the exact opposite of Mitch hedberg, who was all about punchlines. He is just a really clever guy who slightly misinterpreted humour and made a career out of it. Or is making fun out of humour.
4 Apr 09:37 - Tegan: Makes me chuckle.  Mitch Hedberg is all about words, but Stewart Lee does a lot more than that - he uses patterns and devices a lot more.
4 Apr 09:37 - Tegan: I think it's much more interesting than what a lot of comedians do
4 Apr 09:38 - Shaggy: I can see why people find him funny, I think he would be excellent beer comrade, I'm just not into his monologues
4 Apr 09:40 - Alex Bunn: I have grown into it
4 Apr 09:41 - Shaggy: And I got used to living with mould in my room.
4 Apr 10:15 - Bongo: Dogs are always in the push-up position
4 Apr 10:16 - Bongo: Classic
4 Apr 10:17 - Bongo: Agree with tegs though Stewart lee is specifically coming from a different angle
4 Apr 12:37 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: Shaggy check out Dan Mintz on youtube
4 Apr 12:37 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: He voices Tina on Bob's Burgers, quite Mitch Hedburgish
4 Apr 12:38 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: Partly it's just funny seeing that voice come out of that face
4 Apr 13:03 - Alex Bunn: Whatup gang. Meeting craig and hayley and otherss for drinks in angel later
4 Apr 13:03 - Alex Bunn: Consider initation extended
4 Apr 13:03 - Alex Bunn: Invitation*
4 Apr 13:05 - Bongo: Awesome, I might join you guys
4 Apr 13:07 - Tegan: Sounds good
4 Apr 13:07 - Tegan: Important but unrelated question:

4 Apr 13:08 - Tegan: What should they call it?
4 Apr 13:09 - Bongo: Pornotron
4 Apr 13:10 - Shaggy: PornHAL

4 Apr 13:35 - Alex Bunn: Pornop

4 Apr 13:58 - Owen: Just thought i would add my sub par one to the mix
4 Apr 14:02 - Tegan: Thanks all- some good thoughts
4 Apr 14:03 - Shaggy: I can't believe there aren't better things to work on
4 Apr 14:04 - Owen: But a kid might see a woman urinate shaggy. Think of the children. Is no one thinking of the children
4 Apr 14:04 - Shaggy: This country is teeming with immigrants and they want to deny us basic human rights
4 Apr 14:05 - Owen: I think shaggy might be voting UKIP guys...
4 Apr 14:05 - Bongo: Yea they looking at it all wrong, they need to integrate education into it
4 Apr 14:05 - Owen: Shotgun teaching that lesson!
4 Apr 14:06 - Bongo: If 3 swingers and 4 couples go to an orgy, how many people were having sex?
4 Apr 14:06 - Owen: I'm perfect for the job. Not only have i had 5 years teaching experience, I also have an encyclopedic knowledge of porn.
4 Apr 14:06 - Owen: 11!
4 Apr 14:06 - Owen: Boom see!
4 Apr 14:07 - Owen: Perfect for the job.
4 Apr 14:07 - Shaggy: For the blow job
4 Apr 14:07 - Bongo: Ahh but I didn't say how many people just wanted to go to watch
4 Apr 14:07 - Bongo: Or how many animals there were
4 Apr 14:09 - Owen: It's a swingers party not a United kingdom independence party.
4 Apr 14:10 - Shaggy: Are they british animals?
4 Apr 15:09 - Jimena: And does sex with oneself count?
4 Apr 15:10 - Jimena: If so, at which point does it count as sex? What are the requirements?
4 Apr 15:11 - Jimena: In fact what are the running sex criteria? A teacher must anticipate such questions
4 Apr 15:20 - Jimena: <Media omitted>
4 Apr 15:20 - Jimena: Frankenplughole
4 Apr 15:29 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: That sounds like a gross sex position

5 Apr 12:14 - Tegan: I'm going to eat too much chocolate
5 Apr 12:15 - Tegan: Up for popping round for movies later though
5 Apr 12:18 - Bongo: Shags your pc is massively freaking me out
5 Apr 12:18 - Bongo: It's doing this weird word replace
5 Apr 12:19 - Bongo: All instances of the word force are being replaced with horse
5 Apr 12:19 - Bongo: Election debate is being replaced by "eating contest"
5 Apr 12:19 - Bongo: I'm too hungover to deal with this!!
5 Apr 12:25 - Tegan: Lol
5 Apr 12:26 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: Haha
5 Apr 12:34 - Shaggy: Oh my god it took you two months to realise!
5 Apr 15:37 - Tegan: <Media omitted>
5 Apr 15:37 - Tegan: Y'all should come and drink beer in the meantime brewery
5 Apr 15:37 - Tegan: If you'd like

5 Apr 16:21 - Shaggy: Hehe yes
5 Apr 16:23 - Shaggy: If you're attempting to summon me though, this time you were unsuccessful

6 Apr 13:50 - Hannah Murphy: Bahahahah
6 Apr 14:04 - Joe Jarman: Lol
6 Apr 14:17 - Owen: Just watched the debates. Right. Thats it. I'm voting UKIP. Can't have these foreign homos coming over here with all their super AIDS! Spreading all their super AIDS on all the surfaces. Foreign homos, with thier super AIDS get 'em out. Send 'em back to homoland with their super AIDS  let them rot in homoland! If they have the audacity to be born in a country without a good healthcare system and an AIDS epidemic let them homo rot in their homo super AIDS. The frogman has spoken.

6 Apr 19:21 - Tegan: I didn't leave my phone in c town
6 Apr 19:21 - Tegan: I left it in my coat pocket
6 Apr 19:23 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: üëç
7 Apr 18:37 - Mike Joyce: Phone broken for a few days....384 messages from the hoard.....your slipping guys....bongo had twice that!!
7 Apr 19:25 - Shaggy: His was broken for over a week to be fair. And if anything it just shows much you're a part of this
7 Apr 20:54 - Mike Joyce: Ok good. Will read back when i have a free few hours. :
7 Apr 21:02 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: <Media omitted>
7 Apr 21:03 - Mike Joyce: Looks like a fusion bbq
7 Apr 21:21 - Sam Roberts: Big meat is coming
7 Apr 21:24 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: <Media omitted>
7 Apr 22:33 - Martha: Wait, when?? Have I missed it?
7 Apr 22:34 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: Just a dress rehearsal
8 Apr 10:06 - Jimena: Is sam wearing a onesie in that picture?
8 Apr 10:07 - Jimena: Or a robe? And by robe i really mean dress.
8 Apr 10:09 - Dave: I think you got in the first time. It's a onesie loving house
8 Apr 10:10 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: He's probably wearing it as we speak
8 Apr 10:22 - Sam Roberts: You caught my bad side
8 Apr 10:22 - Sam Roberts: The one without a tail
8 Apr 10:22 - Sam Roberts: Great bbq everyone who came
8 Apr 10:23 - Sam Roberts: Everyone who didn't, that was just the warm up for big meat Monday
8 Apr 10:23 - Sam Roberts: All welcome, bring meat!!!
8 Apr 10:48 - Pete Morey: Wha?!  When does it commence?!
8 Apr 10:48 - Pete Morey: I'll bring mead of honey dew and a fine hock
8 Apr 10:48 - Pete Morey: Plus bacon,  black.
8 Apr 14:07 - Jimena: Lol. I didnt know onesies were back. Although i know they are very popular in australia
8 Apr 14:11 - Jimena: <Media omitted>
8 Apr 14:11 - Jimena: Good friend of mine went through a onesie modelling phase
8 Apr 14:12 - Shaggy: Australia's climate is not great for onesies
8 Apr 14:12 - Jimena: <Media omitted>
8 Apr 14:13 - Jimena: Maybe they are in a different material..
8 Apr 14:15 - Jimena: http://www.onesiestore.com.au/shop/animal-onesies
8 Apr 14:22 - Shaggy: Nah they is the same what we have http://www.kigu.co.uk
8 Apr 14:25 - Krizia: I really don't get the popularity of kigus!! Why would you want to dress up as a fat and big animal?
8 Apr 14:25 - Krizia: Specially in Australia!  Whyyyyy would you use one in the beach! !!üò©
8 Apr 14:26 - Krizia: Whyyyyy! !!!
8 Apr 14:26 - Krizia: :p
8 Apr 14:46 - Shaggy: Fat is the new black
8 Apr 14:46 - Shaggy: And animals were always sexy
8 Apr 14:48 - Krizia: Mmmmmmm no
8 Apr 14:53 - Vanessa: I agree with Krizia
8 Apr 14:55 - Shaggy: <Media omitted>
8 Apr 15:04 - Jimena: Are you ladies not familiar with 'fat pants'?
8 Apr 15:05 - Jimena: I.e. Stretchy loose clothes you can comfortably binge in?
8 Apr 15:07 - Jimena: Two: a onesie is much like a blankie that hugs all your body at once.
8 Apr 15:11 - Sam Roberts: Great points Jimena
8 Apr 15:11 - Sam Roberts: it's also impossible to be unhappy in a onesie
8 Apr 15:20 - Tegan: I think that is probably true
8 Apr 15:20 - Tegan: I am remembering how happy Shaggy was as the marshmallow dude from ghostbusters
8 Apr 15:23 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: <Media omitted>
8 Apr 15:24 - Shaggy: Cananabananalism
8 Apr 15:41 - Tegan: Yaaaaaay!!
8 Apr 16:53 - Krizia: Jajajajajajjsjs
8 Apr 16:53 - Krizia: Better to be gigant fruits
8 Apr 16:53 - Krizia: Jhjajajajjajaja
8 Apr 17:01 - Krizia: Than animals
8 Apr 17:01 - Krizia: Ajjajaj
8 Apr 17:27 - Shaggy: Like a giant butternut squash
8 Apr 17:27 - Shaggy: Or a cashew
9 Apr 00:00 - Jimena: <Media omitted>
9 Apr 08:30 - Shaggy: They're not wrong
9 Apr 08:32 - Tegan: no, they are wrong
9 Apr 08:33 - Tegan: It's more like the answer to 'what ended at the onset of 1896?'
9 Apr 08:38 - Hannah Murphy: Harsh Tegan, harsh
9 Apr 08:59 - Shaggy: Pedant
9 Apr 09:02 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: Lol I was gona say that too Tegan, but didn't want to be the smartass
9 Apr 09:03 - Dave: Half marks
9 Apr 09:03 - Shaggy: Sounds like you have the grumps again. Get some coffee
9 Apr 09:05 - Sam Roberts: Shaggy calling Tegan a pedant? What is this, opposite day?
9 Apr 09:05 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: To be fair, that kid was trying to be a smartass, gotta get it right
9 Apr 09:05 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: Like Muphries law
9 Apr 09:05 - Shaggy: Muffries
9 Apr 09:10 - Henry Dranks: Surely it can end in 1896 because it doesnt end simultaneously around the world
9 Apr 09:10 - Henry Dranks: Some bits of the world are un 1896 while others still in 1895
9 Apr 09:22 - Tegan: I'm with Mike
9 Apr 09:22 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: True, but you can't say we're 'in' Wednesday because it is in Hawaii
9 Apr 09:23 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: Its mutually exclusive for each time zone
9 Apr 09:24 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: I can see this being one of those "oh my god, 136 messages from the Horde, wtf" arguments, so I'm going to take a step back now
9 Apr 10:01 - Henry Dranks: Haha wheres the fun in that
9 Apr 10:10 - Alex Bunn: Boring!
9 Apr 10:17 - Krizia: <Media omitted>
9 Apr 10:17 - Krizia: Hawaiii
9 Apr 10:17 - Krizia: Sorry guys that's the only thing I got from the conversation
9 Apr 10:17 - Krizia: :)
9 Apr 11:22 - Jimena: I personally think that any valid answer should be accepted as its the person writing the exams job to word thinks clearly. Teacher might also want to give a lesson on deducing what kind of answer is expected given a context.
9 Apr 11:24 - Jimena: Finally i agree w tegan and mike that as the answer given was actually not valid that should be pointed out to the kid. Whether kid wants to be a smartass or not he should make sure his answer is valid.
9 Apr 11:26 - Jimena: I have been humbled a few times by little kids outsmarting me. For example one time kids were really noisy and i yelled and asked if they could hear me. A little 4 year old said to me:
9 Apr 11:26 - Jimena: Of course i can hear you. I have ears.
9 Apr 11:27 - Jimena: So i never asked things in that way again.
9 Apr 11:30 - Jimena: Another time i told kids off for telling each other off. I said 'I'M the police'. And a 6 or 7 year old said 'no, the POLICE is the police.' So i had to rephrase things differently
9 Apr 11:31 - Jimena: Btw the example before came from an Indian friend
9 Apr 11:31 - Jimena: (The one in the photo)
9 Apr 11:32 - Vanessa: Not everyone with ears can hear
9 Apr 11:32 - Vanessa: That's what I would have told the kid
9 Apr 11:32 - Jimena: Lol. She was 4. But touch√©.
9 Apr 11:33 - Jimena: <Media omitted>
9 Apr 11:33 - Shaggy: Lol
9 Apr 11:34 - Shaggy: Freddie, johny, ...
9 Apr 11:34 - Tegan: Now that's some quality wisecracking
9 Apr 11:38 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: <Media omitted>
9 Apr 12:25 - Sam Roberts: I'm just signing up to do a mud run with a chap from work anyone fancy it?
9 Apr 12:25 - Sam Roberts: 12k jog with a few obstacles and stuff
9 Apr 12:26 - Alex Bunn: I bet its one of those tough mudder things!
9 Apr 12:27 - Alex Bunn: I'm keen depending in dates

9 Apr 12:28 - Sam Roberts: http://www.back2thetrenches.co.uk/events.php#.VQKwc0Jcfds
9 Apr 12:29 - Sam Roberts: I'm signing up for the June run just now
9 Apr 12:33 - Vanessa: I'd be in but can't do June, perhaps the Sept one
9 Apr 12:55 - Bongo: How much is it?
9 Apr 12:55 - Bongo: I love the sound of everything except the jogging
9 Apr 12:56 - Bongo: If there's a shop mobility lane inbetween obstacles I'm in
9 Apr 13:01 - Joe Jarman: <Media omitted>
9 Apr 13:02 - Bongo: Sigkt?
9 Apr 13:02 - Tegan: First, master the use of basic grammar
9 Apr 13:03 - Tegan: Then discuss human rights
9 Apr 13:03 - Tegan: 's Maslow, innit
9 Apr 13:07 - Joe Jarman: Fight!
9 Apr 13:48 - Alex Bunn: Harry has some beef
9 Apr 14:07 - Owen: I am not sure anyone has the right to fight anyone else. Harry seems to think girls have fighting rights, i am pretty sure they don't; unless there is some blasted EU regulation, get Britain out so boys can punch girls again.
9 Apr 14:20 - Tegan: agreed
9 Apr 14:20 - Tegan: no
9 Apr 14:20 - Tegan: wait..
9 Apr 15:15 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: Do you have the right to fight for your right to party?
9 Apr 15:50 - Bongo: Let's just agree to party
9 Apr 17:13 - Vanessa: Is someone going to be in ctown around 6:30pmish?

9 Apr 17:42 - Angela: Is the paperclip club some kind of biker gang?
9 Apr 17:56 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: Its his old graffiti moniker for reasons long forgotten
9 Apr 17:57 - Sam Roberts: Get me a wings one pls
9 Apr 17:57 - Sam Roberts: I'm good for it, I swear
9 Apr 17:58 - Tegan: are they soft?

9 Apr 18:09 - Joe Jarman: Yeah I could go for a beer
9 Apr 18:09 - Joe Jarman: I'm in the wharf atm. Just about to leave
9 Apr 18:10 - Shaggy: Hmm I guess cat and canary has a nice outside bit
9 Apr 18:10 - Joe Jarman: Are you far?
9 Apr 18:10 - Shaggy: At work
9 Apr 18:11 - Joe Jarman: You wanna come here then?
9 Apr 18:11 - Shaggy: I haven't quite finish, I could aim for 7
9 Apr 18:18 - Joe Jarman: I wonder if Dave is here
9 Apr 18:22 - Joe Jarman: I could come towards you mate tbh
9 Apr 18:22 - Joe Jarman: I could do with getting out of east London
9 Apr 18:24 - Shaggy: Huge
9 Apr 18:24 - Shaggy: Hehe
9 Apr 18:24 - Shaggy: In that case the George is nice and near the station
9 Apr 18:25 - Joe Jarman: London bridge?
9 Apr 18:25 - Shaggy: Yup
9 Apr 18:26 - Joe Jarman: Ok
9 Apr 18:28 - Shaggy: Sweet
9 Apr 18:28 - Shaggy: I'll be waiting with a beer for you
9 Apr 18:38 - Joe Jarman: Sounds like a good deal üëç
9 Apr 18:42 - Joe Jarman: You here yet?
9 Apr 18:44 - Shaggy: Locking up at work
9 Apr 18:51 - Joe Jarman: What do you want
9 Apr 18:53 - Mateusz: George?

9 Apr 19:16 - Lorna: Faltering fullback?...
10 Apr 14:38 - Bongo: Anyone know a good organiser app
10 Apr 14:38 - Bongo: Like outlook does with meetings
10 Apr 14:39 - Tegan: Google?
10 Apr 14:41 - Bongo: Yea cool
10 Apr 14:41 - Bongo: I should always answer questions with "Google" it's almost always the right answer
10 Apr 14:41 - Bongo: Cheers tegs!
10 Apr 14:42 - Tegan: I don't think Google calendars is as good as outlook somehow
10 Apr 14:43 - Tegan: Maybe it's because I don't check my Google account as often
10 Apr 14:43 - Tegan: Are you coming out tonight, Bongo?
10 Apr 14:47 - Bongo: Nah going down to redhill to see a mate about a job

10 Apr 19:54 - Dave: 5 mins
10 Apr 20:00 - Sam Roberts: George was full, hope to katzenjammer instead. Big beer!
11 Apr 12:41 - Tegan: How's Jules getting on?
11 Apr 12:48 - Sam Roberts: Yeah good, still on the mocktail sales trail
11 Apr 12:48 - Sam Roberts: He's gone from running a stall to distribution though
11 Apr 12:48 - Sam Roberts: Sounds hella hard work at the mo, could grow pretty quickly with a bit of luck though
11 Apr 12:48 - Tegan: I have no idea what that means :)
11 Apr 13:01 - Sam Roberts: Ah he has this little company selling alcohol free cocktails
11 Apr 13:01 - Sam Roberts: Or mocktails, for the cool kids
11 Apr 13:06 - Shaggy: Cocktail without alcohol is like anything without beer
11 Apr 15:07 - Steven: I can think of nothing that cannot he improved by alcohol.
11 Apr 15:10 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: Cycling lol
11 Apr 15:11 - Shaggy: It gives +10 to cycling but -100 to balance
11 Apr 15:14 - Sam Roberts: 3 beers gives you the best cycling skills
11 Apr 15:17 - Shaggy: But also remove any ability to resist drinking more beers
11 Apr 15:18 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: I agree, I think 3 beers Mike is better than me at a lot of things
11 Apr 15:18 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: At least 3 beers Mike thinks that
11 Apr 15:36 - Sam Roberts: 3 beers Mike is a real swell guy
11 Apr 15:37 - Sam Roberts: Speaking of, we're having a beer in Bermondsey if anyone wants some sun and fun
11 Apr 15:38 - Vanessa: Are you at the local breweries under the arches?
11 Apr 15:39 - Shaggy: Oh sweet I'll join ya

11 Apr 16:40 - Hannah Murphy: Ru Paul!!!
11 Apr 17:53 - Shaggy: <Media omitted>
11 Apr 20:14 - Mateusz: What's happening people?
11 Apr 22:11 - Shaggy: Ah sorry dude just saw
11 Apr 22:12 - Shaggy: Just got out at e&c. What you up to?
12 Apr 10:19 - Sam Roberts: <Media omitted>
12 Apr 10:24 - Vinay: Just heard that news...
12 Apr 10:24 - Vinay: Not going d/l them to watch them all at once, though...
12 Apr 10:29 - Sam Roberts: It's going to be a rough 3 weeks...
12 Apr 10:33 - Shaggy: What...do we still do it every Monday or do we have a week of BBQ?
12 Apr 10:53 - Tegan: mondays!
12 Apr 10:53 - Tegan: Damn that full
12 Apr 10:53 - Tegan: fool
12 Apr 10:53 - Tegan: Just as mondays were about to have meaning again
12 Apr 10:56 - Dave: This is sad news. Mondays are an event woth GoT. If we just download it all then it will all be spent in a few days and forgotten rather than being a joy of spring and summer. I think we should all agree to only download one a week.
12 Apr 10:59 - Shaggy: I'm in. Very convincing argument
12 Apr 11:00 - Sam Roberts: Well spoken Dave! I'm in
12 Apr 11:01 - Sam Roberts: Just gotta go delete the imgur and reddit apps...
12 Apr 11:01 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: I reckon Joe is watching them as we speak lol
12 Apr 11:02 - Alex Bunn: If you watch all 4 then you have to wait a month for the 5th!!!
12 Apr 11:03 - Bongo: For the love of god, why would they do this to us?!
12 Apr 11:04 - Alex Bunn: Damn those hackers
12 Apr 11:09 - Dave: Glad it's only a few. I also wager joe is all over this!
12 Apr 11:10 - Alex Bunn: Looks like we'll have to silence him
12 Apr 11:11 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: I read that HBO send out screeners for TV reviewers
12 Apr 11:11 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: If that's true, it's completely retarded
12 Apr 11:12 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: Also, quality is only 480p, not good enough!
12 Apr 11:31 - Tegan: bah
12 Apr 11:31 - Tegan: I shit 480p
12 Apr 11:31 - Tegan: (I don't know what that means :))
12 Apr 11:38 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: 480p means not HD basically
12 Apr 11:39 - Owen: <Media omitted>
12 Apr 11:39 - Dan Sluckin: Hahaha
12 Apr 11:39 - Dan Sluckin: Keep it!
12 Apr 11:40 - Eliza: Shut up Dan! He will listen to you.
12 Apr 11:40 - Lorna: Is quite convenient it ran out of battery just as you shaved a moustache
12 Apr 11:41 - Eliza: No, not convenient. That is the opposite of convenient.
12 Apr 11:43 - Owen: The reason my head is turned like that is to hide the extra long side burn
12 Apr 11:46 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: Kill it with fire
12 Apr 11:50 - Bongo: Hahaha
12 Apr 11:52 - Bongo: <Media omitted>
12 Apr 12:02 - Joe Jarman: <Media omitted>
12 Apr 12:05 - Bongo: None of that joe
12 Apr 12:06 - Joe Jarman: Watch the full episode now on.... Whatsapp!
12 Apr 12:06 - Joe Jarman: 20 3 minute chunks
12 Apr 12:06 - Joe Jarman: For maximum enjoyment
12 Apr 12:08 - Owen: 20 3second chunks that are the biggest spoilers.
12 Apr 12:10 - Joe Jarman: Nah that's just the intro
12 Apr 12:12 - Owen: Wow I just watched it. Who would have thought that snape is really the ghost of arya.
12 Apr 12:14 - Shaggy: Snape, snape, Severus snape
12 Apr 19:41 - Vanessa: Does anybody have marketing experience/specialisation?
12 Apr 19:47 - Bongo: In what context?
12 Apr 19:48 - Vanessa: Events
12 Apr 19:48 - Bongo: We have a mate who used to do it for a living
12 Apr 19:48 - Bongo: Sam saw him yesterday!
12 Apr 19:49 - Vanessa: I'm doing an event to get people to sign up to a service. I'm wondering when is the best time after the event to send a message to get them to sign up
12 Apr 19:49 - Vanessa: The mocktail guy?
12 Apr 19:49 - Bongo: Yea!
12 Apr 19:51 - Bongo: With my extremely limited knowledge of marketing is say anywhere between 2 days and a week
12 Apr 19:51 - Vanessa: Lol
12 Apr 19:51 - Vanessa: I need them to sign up ASAP
12 Apr 19:53 - Bongo: Should've done it at the event then
12 Apr 19:53 - Vanessa: It hasn't happened
12 Apr 19:53 - Vanessa: Yet
12 Apr 19:53 - Vanessa: So I basically need them to sign up soon after they leave the event
12 Apr 19:54 - Bongo: Ahh
12 Apr 19:54 - Bongo: Can't you try to get them to do it at the event?
12 Apr 19:54 - Vanessa: It's online booking so I could but most will be occupied with their kids
12 Apr 19:56 - Bongo: Does it involve money?
12 Apr 19:56 - Vanessa: The booking yes, they are paying for a service
12 Apr 19:56 - Vanessa: The event is free
12 Apr 19:57 - Bongo: Send them an email straight after then
12 Apr 19:57 - Bongo: As just a thanks for coming email
12 Apr 19:57 - Vanessa: Yeah that's what I was thinking but I didn't know exactly how long to wait
12 Apr 19:57 - Bongo: But with a subtle "give me all your money" at the end
12 Apr 19:57 - Vanessa: I've already written the text to send them
12 Apr 19:58 - Vanessa: üí∞üí∞üí∞üí∞
12 Apr 19:58 - Bongo: Straight after the event
12 Apr 19:58 - Vanessa: Ok cool
12 Apr 19:58 - Bongo: My 2-7 days answer earlier was assuming you'd already bugged them at the event
12 Apr 19:58 - Vanessa: Thanks for your advice
12 Apr 19:59 - Vanessa: I will follow up with an email a week later
12 Apr 19:59 - Bongo: Np! As with most of my advice I take no responsibility for the outcome
12 Apr 19:59 - Vanessa: That's ok
12 Apr 19:59 - Vanessa: I'll just remember to lace all your food with sugar
12 Apr 20:00 - Bongo: Like my advice to shaggy to keep on drinking when he clearly shouldn't have kept on drinking
12 Apr 20:00 - Bongo: Ah dude I've broken the sugar thing hard lately
12 Apr 20:01 - Bongo: <Media omitted>
12 Apr 20:01 - Bongo: Two words: fizzy laces
12 Apr 20:01 - Vanessa: Sunday dinner
12 Apr 22:27 - Shaggy: Nine eleven
13 Apr 08:00 - Sam Roberts: Happy game of thrones day everyone!
13 Apr 08:00 - Dave: Yay!
13 Apr 08:01 - Sam Roberts: üçõ + üçó +üç∫ to celebrate!
13 Apr 08:01 - Dave: üëë
13 Apr 08:02 - Sam Roberts: üòÉ
13 Apr 08:02 - Sam Roberts: üò≥
13 Apr 08:02 - Sam Roberts: üò±
13 Apr 08:02 - Sam Roberts: üòµ
13 Apr 08:02 - Dave: üíÄ
13 Apr 08:02 - Sam Roberts: The story of Oberyn
13 Apr 08:02 - Sam Roberts: Haha
13 Apr 08:02 - Dave: Too soon
13 Apr 08:03 - Dave: üò≠
13 Apr 08:14 - Bongo: Woohoo game of thrones! What time are we barbying?
13 Apr 08:16 - Sam Roberts: Early if poss, gets dark about 7.30 at the mo, so half six would be great
13 Apr 08:17 - Sam Roberts: You ready to make your return as Lord of the lamb chop bong?
13 Apr 08:23 - Bongo: üò¶
13 Apr 08:23 - Bongo: But there's not enough time to marinade?!
13 Apr 08:23 - Bongo: I'll improvise!!
13 Apr 08:24 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: Fried egg!
13 Apr 08:24 - Bongo: Egg fried between two half cooked pork chops is always a good fall back
13 Apr 08:25 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: üéº it's the most, wonderful time, of the year üé∂
13 Apr 08:55 - Sam Roberts: Maybe if you massage the marinade it'll soak faster
13 Apr 09:24 - Bongo: I heard if you put an egg between the chops it also makes it marinade faster
13 Apr 09:33 - Dave: I heard if you put an egg on an egg it makes it eggier
13 Apr 09:34 - Dave: üê£
13 Apr 09:40 - Tegan: Yay for eggs!
13 Apr 09:53 - Alex Bunn: Yay! If you look after them correctly they turn into delicious meat
13 Apr 09:54 - Bongo: And sometimes a Jesus pops out
13 Apr 09:54 - Tegan: other steps need tobe in place for that to happen
13 Apr 09:54 - Alex Bunn: üê£üê•üêîüçóüçó
13 Apr 09:54 - Bongo: That's how Easter works right?
13 Apr 09:55 - Tegan: When mummt and daddy chickens love each other very much etc
13 Apr 12:02 - Alex Bunn: So who's coming round tonight??
13 Apr 12:02 - Alex Bunn: Hype hype hype
13 Apr 12:03 - Tegan: hype!
13 Apr 12:03 - Tegan: 'xcited
13 Apr 12:03 - Shaggy: Hype!
13 Apr 12:12 - Sadie: Me!
13 Apr 12:12 - Shaggy: You were supposed to say hype!
13 Apr 12:12 - Bongo: Hype hype hype!
13 Apr 12:12 - Shaggy removed Sadie
13 Apr 12:13 - Shaggy added Sadie
13 Apr 12:14 - Shaggy: Try again
13 Apr 12:14 - Sadie: Hype..hype..
13 Apr 12:17 - Bongo: Shaggy stop bullying your colleagues
13 Apr 12:18 - Shaggy: Bitch, don't tell me what to do
13 Apr 12:18 - Shaggy removed Bongo
13 Apr 12:21 - Shaggy added Bongo
13 Apr 12:39 - Loz: I won't be able to make it tonight but I'm keen to join next week!!
13 Apr 12:46 - Bongo: We need to decide on how we're going to watch them
13 Apr 12:46 - Bongo: First one today then next three on the weekend?
13 Apr 12:46 - Bongo: Or one a week?
13 Apr 12:47 - Dave: One a week
13 Apr 12:51 - Bongo: Next week round shabongo's?
13 Apr 12:51 - Bongo: Or is that going to cause massive aggro from c town lol
13 Apr 12:52 - Dave: You'll need a bbq or equivalent delight
13 Apr 12:53 - Bongo: Damnit you're right
13 Apr 13:00 - Joe Jarman: You don't have a television
13 Apr 13:00 - Joe Jarman: Either
13 Apr 13:00 - Joe Jarman: Or any furniture
13 Apr 13:02 - Joe Jarman: After you've met these requirements, you can submit an application to the game of thrones hosting committee
13 Apr 13:08 - Eliza: Two hypes here. What can we bring?
13 Apr 13:12 - Bongo: We have furniture, agree about the tv though, we're still working on the 72' screen
13 Apr 13:21 - Lorna: Hype!
13 Apr 13:50 - Tegan: Further hype!
13 Apr 13:51 - Tegan: enough work!
13 Apr 13:55 - Bongo: Lol @ people at work
13 Apr 13:56 - Alex Bunn: You have the honourable position of replacing the phil as chief meat prep guy
13 Apr 13:56 - Alex Bunn: Prep that meat!
13 Apr 13:57 - Bongo: Ah bugger I knew I was meant to be doing something
13 Apr 13:58 - Bongo: Marinading will seriously take too long
13 Apr 13:58 - Bongo: I might just slap sauce on it
13 Apr 13:59 - Bongo: If I get the technique right maybe I can punch it into the meat
13 Apr 13:59 - Bongo: I'll call Phil, he'll know what to do
13 Apr 14:06 - Owen: Bbq sauce
13 Apr 14:07 - Owen: You don't need to marrinade if you are using bbq sauce
13 Apr 14:16 - Bongo: Ready made BBQ sauce?
13 Apr 14:28 - Owen: Could do. It is easy to make though. Eliza might be able to tell you how, her bbq sauce is saucegasmnic!
13 Apr 14:34 - Bongo: <Media omitted>
13 Apr 14:34 - Bongo: Going to try this with onions, parsley and garlic
13 Apr 14:38 - Owen: Mistake! Make your own its easy! We can bring liquid smoke if you are missing that.
13 Apr 14:38 - Tegan: How was your interview, dude?
13 Apr 14:39 - Owen: Oh yeah! How'd it go?
13 Apr 14:57 - Bongo: Ok, we can make it in c town then
13 Apr 14:57 - Bongo: I smashed the interview, it's a pretty drawn out one though
13 Apr 14:57 - Bongo: Two more rounds, 5 more people to see
13 Apr 14:58 - Owen: Did you get asked what you greatest weakness was?
13 Apr 14:59 - Bongo: No, mostly experience questions
13 Apr 14:59 - Owen: And did you then answer "I often get told I work too hard and well"
13 Apr 14:59 - Bongo: Then all of sudden random programming questions I had to write on paper
13 Apr 15:01 - Bongo: Lol I've heard some really stupid answers to that question
13 Apr 15:01 - Bongo: That's nowhere near as bad as some of them
13 Apr 15:02 - Owen: "I often chase other employees with a mallet"... "oh sorry, you wanted me to lie"
13 Apr 15:04 - Bongo: Someone said "i start hearing a voice in my head when I get stressed telling me what to do"
13 Apr 15:04 - Bongo: Not in an interview I was in, but that's still extremely creepy
13 Apr 15:05 - Owen: "I have been told that I am too generous a lover....  Ladies"
13 Apr 15:06 - Owen: Wow,  that's mega creepy, why would you answer that in an interview.
13 Apr 15:07 - Owen: I bet he went away with the voice saying "nailed it!"
13 Apr 15:08 - Bongo: Haha yea "nailed it! Well done chap. Now.. Er.. Burn that chair.."
13 Apr 15:09 - Owen: To be fair that is such a pointlessly crap question for anything but a sales job. It's basically the same as asking "could you bull shit for us a bit please"
13 Apr 15:18 - Bongo: Yea I've never asked it
13 Apr 15:19 - Bongo: I usually ask something along the lines of "if I were to suggest getting wasted for the next hour, what would you do?"
13 Apr 15:20 - Owen: I've not been asked it.  To be fair teaching interviews are pretty good.  You just teach a lesson and if you do well then the interview is just to make sure you aren't a complete loon.
13 Apr 15:21 - Owen: Is the correct answer "I would"
13 Apr 15:25 - Bongo: That only gets half marks
13 Apr 15:25 - Bongo: The correct answer is the sound of a beer being opened
13 Apr 15:57 - Shaggy: Let's start organizing this shiz
13 Apr 16:21 - Owen: What time will someone actually be in at Canning town.  Last time me and Eliza turned up at the designated time there was no one in.
13 Apr 16:21 - Angela: I think that's a formal letter of complaint!
13 Apr 16:21 - Joe Jarman: Frank.is always in
13 Apr 16:22 - Owen: I'm going to make Bbq sauce here.
13 Apr 16:22 - Joe Jarman: He hasn't taken to bbqing as much as we hoped
13 Apr 16:22 - Owen: He should with a name like frank
13 Apr 16:22 - Joe Jarman: He looks like he should be wicked at bbqing
13 Apr 16:26 - Alex Bunn: He's all about that protein
13 Apr 16:30 - Shaggy: <Media omitted>
13 Apr 16:36 - Alex Bunn: üò±
13 Apr 16:36 - Alex Bunn: The sassagr flair
13 Apr 16:37 - Alex Bunn: Sassages are coming
13 Apr 16:38 - Shaggy: Yes
13 Apr 16:38 - Shaggy: I've got to go to balham first though to retrieve my card
13 Apr 16:46 - Alex Bunn: Did you leave it in a pub?
13 Apr 16:57 - Tegan: I'm aiming for around 6.30
13 Apr 16:57 - Tegan: wit vegan delights
13 Apr 17:00 - Shaggy: Yup, left without paying the tab
13 Apr 17:00 - Bongo: I have the chops btw Owen, if you're good to make the BBQ sauce
13 Apr 17:03 - Shaggy: Lol shit, I wish I just said I lost it
13 Apr 17:04 - Owen: Bbq sauce is simmering atm
13 Apr 17:27 - Lorna: I'll be there for 6:30ish. Any requests for food etc to bring?
13 Apr 17:51 - Shaggy: I got the sassage
13 Apr 17:51 - Shaggy: As indicated by flair
13 Apr 17:56 - Shaggy: Jubilee line is pretty fucked, I would recommend dlr from bank
13 Apr 17:57 - Sadie: We're bringing a few burgers, some halloumi, crisps and hummus
13 Apr 18:03 - Owen: From where shagzilla?
13 Apr 18:03 - Owen: We get on at Canada water
13 Apr 18:07 - Owen: Actually we will just continue on to shadwell and dlt
13 Apr 18:07 - Owen: Dlr*
13 Apr 18:09 - Shaggy: Yeah that's easier, jubilee is hella delayed so tonnes of people
13 Apr 18:12 - Steven: Jubilee is a disaster
13 Apr 18:14 - Shaggy: I did warn you
13 Apr 18:15 - Sam Roberts: Boo meetings
13 Apr 18:16 - Sam Roberts: Just jumping in the bike, back in 30
13 Apr 18:16 - Sam Roberts: Sorry sorry sorry to anyone who's there before that!
13 Apr 18:19 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: Central line is horrendous too agggh
14 Apr 07:55 - Tegan: Hey guys - did I leave my bag in your garden?
14 Apr 07:57 - Sam Roberts: <Media omitted>
14 Apr 07:59 - Tegan: ooh, can you bring me the green one
14 Apr 08:00 - Sam Roberts: I, I'll be there in 5
14 Apr 08:02 - Tegan: I'll swap you an awesome coffee
14 Apr 08:02 - Tegan: is it super cheeky to ask you to take it to kx with you?
14 Apr 08:02 - Sam Roberts: Hehe yes, I'm on it üòâ
14 Apr 08:03 - Tegan: Whoop! Thanks Slam
14 Apr 08:03 - Sam Roberts: Did you pack it with rocks!?
14 Apr 08:04 - Tegan: 'alledgedly' I had too much to 'drink'
14 Apr 08:04 - Tegan: Sorry
14 Apr 08:05 - Tegan: excellent inaugural Monday, everyone
14 Apr 08:38 - Bongo: Haha yea that was thoroughly meaty and game of thronesy
14 Apr 08:49 - Sam Roberts: Lot if fun
14 Apr 08:49 - Sam Roberts: Our garden looks like Barbageddon
14 Apr 08:55 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: Aporkalypse
14 Apr 08:57 - Sam Roberts: fitting, Bongo's marinade was the Blend of thyme
14 Apr 08:58 - Sam Roberts: Was that the biggest one yet?
14 Apr 08:59 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: We all fit in the projector room
14 Apr 08:59 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: So no
14 Apr 09:00 - Sam Roberts: Ish... Bongo sat on me and Cate
14 Apr 09:00 - Shaggy: It's the first year of dual couching
14 Apr 09:03 - Owen: Bongo's marinade?  BONGO'S MARINADE?!
14 Apr 09:04 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: Good job bongo
14 Apr 09:11 - Owen: BBBOOOONNNNGGGGGOOOOOOO!!?!?!?!!!?
14 Apr 09:28 - Alex Bunn: Was daario a different guy from last season?
14 Apr 09:33 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: Definitely not the original guy
14 Apr 09:33 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: <Media omitted>
14 Apr 09:37 - Bongo: Cheers guys, I put a lot of love into that marinade
14 Apr 10:00 - Alex Bunn: That was the dude from season 3
14 Apr 10:17 - Shaggy: Haha
14 Apr 11:43 - Owen: A bear walks into a bar, he sits down and immediately mauls to death and devours the woman on the stool next to him. he then calmly orders a beer

bartender: "sorry, we don't serve drug users in here" bear: "but I don't do drugs" bartender: "what about that barbitchyouate"
14 Apr 11:55 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: Lol, good joke bongo
14 Apr 11:58 - Bongo: Cheers, my creative humour knows no limits
14 Apr 11:59 - Owen: Oh god.  This is my worst nightmare.
14 Apr 11:59 - Bongo: No it's not I'm actually having a really nice day
14 Apr 12:00 - Owen: You'll pay for this in time.
14 Apr 12:04 - Owen: Actually I might use this against my more attention seeking pupils. Just start falsely attributing thier behaviour to others and praising them for it.
14 Apr 12:13 - Shaggy: Great idea, bongo
14 Apr 14:19 - Vanessa: Don't talk of the episode yesterday I still haven't seen it
14 Apr 14:32 - Owen: Ned starks ghost came back and ate off jofferys dead face! It was amazing!
14 Apr 15:01 - Owen: It also turned out carl drogo and the dragon drogon were the same thing all along... The clue was in the name.
14 Apr 15:03 - Angela: http://voteswap.org/
14 Apr 15:08 - Shaggy: Carl drogo is basically Carl pilkington as khal
14 Apr 15:10 - Owen: Voteswap is awesome.  Its a shame they don't have it for lib dems as well. I have to vote lib dem in my stupid area even though i really don't want to.
14 Apr 15:12 - Angela: I would feel like I had to vote labour without it, which I'm not particularly keen to do and would only do cos my MP is good. Voting for ed miliband though, euch
14 Apr 15:13 - Dave: This is great
14 Apr 15:14 - Shaggy: I like milliband
14 Apr 15:14 - Shaggy: He is the only sincere and passionate one
14 Apr 15:14 - Shaggy: He may be a bit goofy though
14 Apr 15:16 - Shaggy: It doesn't matter what I vote though, in my area it's always been lib dems
14 Apr 15:16 - Owen: Problem is that in this country with our stupid system you are very unlikely to get to vote who you want.
14 Apr 15:16 - Angela: He may be sincere but he has no ideas of his own
14 Apr 15:17 - Dave: I think lib dems may be in for a rough ride this time shagz
14 Apr 15:17 - Angela: His main policy is "slightly less austerity than the conservatives"
14 Apr 15:17 - Owen: And free bus passes for dogs Angela.
14 Apr 15:17 - Angela: But cats though? When will this country see a sensible policy on bus passes for cats?
14 Apr 15:18 - Owen: It's like watching the kang and kodos election.
14 Apr 15:18 - Dave: Lol
14 Apr 15:18 - Owen: Everyone just says what you want to hear and whoever gets into power we are all gonna be slaves to an alien race.
14 Apr 15:18 - Owen: Except in my analogy the alien race are the rich.
14 Apr 15:19 - Dave: To be fair, there's about a 20bn pound divide between their spending plans as labour don't include capital expenditure
14 Apr 15:19 - Dave: *dustball comment*
14 Apr 15:20 - Owen: What counts as capital expenditure dave?
14 Apr 15:21 - Jimena: <Media omitted>
14 Apr 15:22 - Jimena: Free dog passes sound pretty sweet to me.
14 Apr 15:22 - Dave: Essentially it's investment, so anything outside of the day to day operating costs of the various departments
14 Apr 15:22 - Dave: So it would be money for building roads, houses, schools and statues of Keynes
14 Apr 15:23 - Dave: 45CHF! Not under a labour government!
14 Apr 15:23 - Owen: What is the reasoning behind not including it?
14 Apr 15:24 - Owen: Just because it is a one off?
14 Apr 15:24 - Dave: It means they can talk about balancing the books and still have money for investment
14 Apr 15:25 - Dave: It's a lot easier to argue for borrowing for investment than for operating costs
14 Apr 15:26 - Owen: Oh right.  Like when i bought that yacht, but it didn't affect my bank balance because i don't have to buy the yacht every year.
14 Apr 15:26 - Jimena: 45chf AND they are not even allowed on the seats!
14 Apr 15:27 - Owen: I'm sorry Jimena i was joking about milliband having free dog bus passes...  As far as i know anyway.
14 Apr 15:27 - Owen: Nigel farage only wants free dog passes for British dogs though.
14 Apr 15:28 - Owen: All those German Shepherds coming over here! Using our buses for free!
14 Apr 15:28 - Owen: And don't get me started on chihuahuas!
14 Apr 15:29 - Owen: Direct quote from the ukip party conference
14 Apr 15:30 - Dave: You happy with the capital expenditure point now O?
14 Apr 15:32 - Dave: Good
14 Apr 15:35 - Jimena: Pff typical.
14 Apr 15:37 - Jimena: Next thing u know they'll be increasing the bus pass fare for non-eu pets.
14 Apr 15:38 - Jimena: Just to cover the costs for the british ones.
14 Apr 15:38 - Jimena: üò¢
14 Apr 15:41 - Owen: Depends what you mean by happy. I understand what capital expenditure is.  But it seems like bullshit to not include it somehow in the deficit. Like my yacht example. Capital expenditure will still increase country debt so i don't see how you can just inore it.
14 Apr 15:42 - Owen: Like why not just add a capital expenditure budget of 20 trillion pounds and then just ignore it.
14 Apr 15:43 - Dave: Not sure i follow the last point. Lab have said they will balance the current account so you can't fiddle it with the capital account.
14 Apr 15:45 - Dave: On why the two are different. Arguably capital investments will bring a return to the country and which will be commensurate in the long term with the borrowing costs
14 Apr 15:45 - Dave: Now i would argue that the same is true of spending on social services, etc but the argument is more controversial
14 Apr 15:46 - Owen: I am a keynsian so i agree with extra capital spending.  I just think it is sneaky to not include it somehow.
14 Apr 15:46 - Dave: You have to borrow for major infrastructure projects
14 Apr 15:46 - Dave: You can't do it on tax revenues
14 Apr 15:47 - Owen: I know. But if you are borrowing that should add to the deficit.
14 Apr 15:47 - Owen: Even if you offset it across 4 years or something.
14 Apr 15:48 - Owen: Or however long their plan is.
14 Apr 15:51 - Dave: I don't see why. Current and capital spending are very different. currebt expenditure is like paying for food - one can argue that unless you are starving you shouldn't spend more on food than you earn. Capital spending is like buying a house - it's silly to save up for one, you borrow what you can afford.
14 Apr 15:51 - Dave: Idealogically there is a distinction between getting rid of a deficit which if based on all spending and one based on current spending
14 Apr 15:52 - Dave: It's not just a way of massaging figures
14 Apr 15:53 - Owen: I get that. But this whole deficit balancing task is being played off by both parties as a way of getting the country out of debt (a bit). So hiding the fact that you are increasing the debt even if you are balancing the deficit is disingenuous.
14 Apr 15:53 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: None of this matters, it's too boring for voters :b
14 Apr 15:56 - Owen: Also i would argue that capital expenditure in the case of a country is a reccuring cost. Just because it is being spent on one off projects doesn't mean another one off project won't come along in a year or two. It isn't the same as me buying a house. 

Also even if you do treat it as the same as me buying a house.  When i buy a house i have to pay it back. Those repayments become part of my personal deficit.  The government will have to payback the money eventually too in whatever means,  inflation or otherwise.
14 Apr 15:57 - Angela: But buying a house isn't the same as having a personal deficit because the money grows
14 Apr 15:57 - Owen: Mortgage repayments are a personal deficit.
14 Apr 15:57 - Angela: And you can borrow against the rising value to gain more money for investment. This isn't the same as just getting into more debt
14 Apr 15:58 - Angela: You technically owe more money but your assets are worth more
14 Apr 15:58 - Owen: Thata true Angela
14 Apr 15:58 - Dave: Indeed, it's a secured loan
14 Apr 15:58 - Owen: Thats*
14 Apr 15:59 - Owen: Good point
14 Apr 15:59 - Angela: I don't know whether the value of whatever the gov is investing in will also grow though?
14 Apr 15:59 - Owen: I think I have changed my mind.
14 Apr 15:59 - Dave: Although the government can't just sell thw M25
14 Apr 15:59 - Dave: Or could they...
14 Apr 15:59 - Owen: They could privatise it
14 Apr 16:00 - Dave: Indeed
14 Apr 16:01 - Owen: This is what I worry about if we get another tory government.
14 Apr 16:01 - Angela: Yeah definitely. I mean they sold the Eurostar which is majorly in profit
14 Apr 16:01 - Owen: This election has just become about a fucking number.
14 Apr 16:01 - Angela: For like 0.00001% deficit reduction
14 Apr 16:02 - Owen: And the tories seem to value making that number zero over any othwr concern.
14 Apr 16:02 - Angela: It's all clearly ideological
14 Apr 16:03 - Dave: Agree
14 Apr 16:03 - Owen: David Cameron blatantly talks like that.  When asked about his promises on things like youth unemployment.  His reply is always "those promises weren't the important ones, deficit reduction was"
14 Apr 16:06 - Owen: He basically says "i care about making this number zero over anything else, including the people." what irks me is that the media and the other main parties go along with this bullshit. The tory party have very shrewdly changed the message.  So that this election has become about the one thing they actually did achive: deficit reduction.
14 Apr 16:06 - Angela: That's so true
14 Apr 16:07 - Angela: Labour have completely fallen into line with the Tory 'divide and conquer' mentality of blaming everything bad that happens on people slightly poorer and therefore lazier than you
14 Apr 16:07 - Angela: Which I think is a major contributor to the success of ukip
14 Apr 16:08 - Owen: Labour and the lib dems should have been calling him on this and they haven't been.  So now its so ingrained that we don't get to discuss people anymore we have to discuss this fucking number. And I don't even get to vote for a party that isn't buying into Cameron bullshit because if I do that waxwork snake will get into power again.  I am fucking sick of it.
14 Apr 16:08 - Angela: Haha waxwork snake
14 Apr 16:10 - Owen: He looks like a madame tusaauds puppet came alive and then somehow started  running the country
14 Apr 16:11 - Angela: Has anybody checked whether the Cameron waxwork is missing...?
14 Apr 16:12 - Owen: I take it back.  The madame tussauds Cameron looks more realistic becausr at least it has a moustache.
14 Apr 16:12 - Owen: <Media omitted>
14 Apr 16:13 - Bongo: I lol'd
14 Apr 16:13 - Angela: It actually does look more like a human
14 Apr 16:13 - Alex Bunn: Iv enjoyed reading this üëç
14 Apr 16:14 - Shaggy: He's get my vote
14 Apr 16:14 - Bongo: Reducing the deficit should be one of the highest priorities though
14 Apr 16:14 - Owen: Not over people.
14 Apr 16:15 - Bongo: Jobs and the economy are affected by the deficit though
14 Apr 16:15 - Angela: As I heard someone say on the radio, Tory policies are like deciding not to feed your kids because you want to pay off the mortgage faster
14 Apr 16:15 - Bongo: We can choose to ignore it and later down the line pay for it massively
14 Apr 16:15 - Owen: The economy is also affected by youth unemployment.
14 Apr 16:15 - Bongo: Or deal with it now at the expense of other things
14 Apr 16:16 - Bongo: Yea but that trade off unfortunately works in the deficit reduction's favour because we are so massively in debt
14 Apr 16:16 - Bongo: Interest on our debt is huuuuge
14 Apr 16:17 - Bongo: Reducing it by a linear about is saving us much much more than spending a linear amount on anything
14 Apr 16:19 - Dave: Would you accept a tax rise rather than a cut under that logic?
14 Apr 16:19 - Owen: Yeah but there are two ways to reduce a defict
14 Apr 16:19 - Angela: I would accept big companies being made to pay their tax
14 Apr 16:19 - Bongo: Tax rise if everyone on the country agrees that removing debt is the best option
14 Apr 16:20 - Bongo: *in
14 Apr 16:20 - Owen: You don't have to do it by spending less. You can do it by raising more.  And the fact you didn't think of that first just shows how well the tories have manipulated the media and the other parties.
14 Apr 16:20 - Bongo: But you don't want people to move out of the country to avoid tax
14 Apr 16:21 - Owen: That is nonsense though bongo.  Its been shown time and time again not to be true.
14 Apr 16:21 - Angela: I think a lot of that is scaremongering. When the minimum wage was introduced the main argument against it was that companies would all react by firing a load of employees. But that didn't happen
14 Apr 16:21 - Angela: If here's the political will then companies tend to fall into line
14 Apr 16:21 - Bongo: People moving out of the country to avoid tax?
14 Apr 16:21 - Angela: The will just doesn't exist
14 Apr 16:22 - Bongo: Big companies already avoid tax by moving out often he country
14 Apr 16:23 - Angela: But they still sell goods in this country
14 Apr 16:23 - Angela: And avoid paying tax on those by not being registered here. There's a loophole to be closed
14 Apr 16:23 - Bongo: The grey area where startups are starting up in the uk could easily just move to other countries
14 Apr 16:23 - Angela: They won't want to stop selling goods here
14 Apr 16:23 - Angela: I'm talking about Amazon though, not startups
14 Apr 16:24 - Angela: It's about making companies pay the tax that is due, not raising all business tax
14 Apr 16:24 - Owen: But you don't increase corporate tax.  You just increase income tax
14 Apr 16:24 - Dave: The amount of tax due from corporates but unclaimed would kill the deficit
14 Apr 16:25 - Bongo: Yea, let's just do that
14 Apr 16:26 - Dave: I may have slightly overstated my last point (need to check the figures) but certainly it would put a fair dent in it
14 Apr 16:26 - Angela: I've also heard that it would be more than the deficit
14 Apr 16:27 - Owen: No.  Bongo, lets cut public services instead. Especially any service aimed at the weak or poor.
14 Apr 16:27 - Bongo: Can we start our own country somewhere hotter than england?
14 Apr 16:27 - Angela: Maybe if it's backdated?
14 Apr 16:27 - Bongo: No one wants to cut public spending
14 Apr 16:28 - Angela: The Conservative party really do
14 Apr 16:29 - Bongo: Well that's just silly
14 Apr 16:32 - Owen: And the problem is that they won't cut health or education (not that they should) because that would lose them votes. Which means that small departments have to take the hit.  A 1% cut to the NHS would be equivalent to a 50% cut on another department.
14 Apr 16:33 - Angela: Though actually neither party is protecting the education budget in their manifesto
14 Apr 16:33 - Owen: The NHS could survive a 1% cut.  A little department can't survive a 50% cut and still do what it does.
14 Apr 16:33 - Owen: They kept saying that education was a protected area during the debates though.
14 Apr 16:34 - Owen: Those little areas are things like libraries. Which are really vital for poor people, but that votera don't generally give a shit about.
14 Apr 16:34 - Angela: Yeah they have protected it either against inflation or per pupil, but no party has committed to both. So if pupil numbers rise or there's inflation, it could still potentially decline in real terms
14 Apr 16:34 - Dave: A report i just found estimates in 2014, 122bn in lost tax (85bn from avoidance, 19bn avoidance and 18bn tax not paid)
14 Apr 16:35 - Owen: 18bn just not paid.  Lol
14 Apr 16:35 - Owen: I wish i could get away with just not paying my tax.
14 Apr 16:35 - Bongo: Become a contractor
14 Apr 16:36 - Shaggy: 85 and 19 are both avoidance?
14 Apr 16:36 - Dave: 85 is evasion (ie illegal)
14 Apr 16:36 - Dave: 19 avoidance through loopholes
14 Apr 16:36 - Bongo: Our deficit last year in total was 107bln
14 Apr 16:36 - Bongo: So just that one year of paying would have wiped the slate clean
14 Apr 16:36 - Owen: So Dave was right and some.
14 Apr 16:37 - Owen: For that year yes.
14 Apr 16:37 - Bongo: But given that it's accumulating at such a high rate and the interest accruing on top of that
14 Apr 16:38 - Bongo: Just one year of paying it all back would be amazing
14 Apr 16:38 - Owen: Interst bill is 43bn alone
14 Apr 16:41 - Hannah Murphy: It's all about improving productivity guys! Kthnxbai
14 Apr 16:42 - Bongo: Nothing improves productivity like another war
14 Apr 16:43 - Bongo: Let's go invade someone
14 Apr 16:43 - Shaggy: I nominate tissue
14 Apr 16:43 - Owen: After delving into this more.  Wales is getting screwed! They have 6.6% of the uk population but only 2% of its spending. Bull shit.  I am voting plaid cymru
14 Apr 16:43 - Shaggy: Russia
14 Apr 16:45 - Dave: Wales got a pretty bad deal during devolution compared to scotland
14 Apr 16:45 - Owen: Scotland respectivel numbers are 8.4% and 3.7% so they didn't do so well either.
14 Apr 16:45 - Bongo: I think we'd get screwed over by Russia personally
14 Apr 16:46 - Bongo: It's pretty much straight sailing between them and us
14 Apr 16:46 - Owen: Let's take back Australia.  They have barely any defense and loads of resources.
14 Apr 16:46 - Dave: Hmm, need to check thoae numbers take account of rhe effects of devolution
14 Apr 16:46 - Dave: I heard Scotland had more spending per head than england
14 Apr 16:46 - Owen: Yeah I'm not sure exactly what the numbers mean dave.
14 Apr 16:47 - Owen: Presumably they don't include  education and health
14 Apr 16:48 - Hannah Murphy: Scotland did very well on the free university side of things
14 Apr 16:52 - Dave: Bbc (quoting the treasury) states scotland has 10876 per head, wales just under 10000 and england has 8529
14 Apr 16:52 - Dave: In 2012-13
14 Apr 16:53 - Angela: UKIP should really be focusing on Scotland
14 Apr 16:53 - Owen: Ah ok.  The numbers i got must not have included health etc spending in wales under "health" not "wales'
14 Apr 16:53 - Angela: Bloody parasites
14 Apr 16:55 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: I thought Scotland GDP is higher than average though?
14 Apr 16:56 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: Not GDP, but they pay roughly a fair amount of tax considering spending
14 Apr 17:25 - Dave: There's a measure called gva (groas value added) which measures how much regions add to gdp. England had 21937 per head and scotland 20013 in 2012 according to the ONS
14 Apr 17:27 - Dave: Wikipedia gives 2014 numbers as 24091 and 21982 respectively
14 Apr 17:27 - Dave: I am data today
14 Apr 17:39 - Bongo: GDP is a bit of a useless stat though right?
14 Apr 17:52 - Lorna: Free Ben and Jerry's ice cream! And sunshine and park! Heading to marble arch now for all of the above x
14 Apr 17:56 - Owen: Two economists are walking down the road and see a turd.  One says to the other I'll give you ¬£20,000 to eat that turd. The other weighs up his options and decides eating it is the rational choice. They keep walking and now the second one sees a turd, he proposes the first eats it for ¬£20,000. The first makes the rational choice and eats it. They keep walking for a bit and the first says wait a minute we both have as much money as we did before the walk but our mouths taste like shit. The second replies "yes, but we increased our GDP by ¬£40,000"
14 Apr 17:56 - Owen: TLDR yes bongo gdp is a pretty silly stat.
14 Apr 18:04 - Bongo: It's a ridiculously old one that needs updating
14 Apr 18:06 - Bongo: I'd give a medal to anyone who can give a number to a country's output
14 Apr 18:07 - Owen: I think how many times i mention my own name should be one.  I only do that during periods of growth.
14 Apr 18:07 - Owen: Actually mike.  You should graph that.
14 Apr 18:07 - Owen: See if it is at all true
14 Apr 18:08 - Tegan: lol. I hope it's true
14 Apr 18:08 - Tegan: excellent calibre of discussion this afternoon, everyone
14 Apr 18:09 - Tegan: I feel more informed than I did by my whole journey with the evening standard
14 Apr 19:13 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: Someone listens to planet money
14 Apr 19:14 - Dave: Who? Bongo or bongo?
14 Apr 19:14 - Owen: Yep.  I liked that one.
14 Apr 19:14 - Owen: Goddamn it!
14 Apr 19:14 - Owen: Seriously i am scared that i am losing my identity
15 Apr 10:21 - Bongo: Holy crap it's hot
15 Apr 10:22 - Bongo: I'm roasting like crispy duck
15 Apr 11:10 - Owen: You chose a good time to get unemployed

15 Apr 13:15 - Alex Bunn: Whats dishoon?
15 Apr 13:19 - Vinay: I was afraid to ask that question
15 Apr 13:19 - Shaggy: Indian
15 Apr 13:20 - Lorna: Its tasty Indian. Tapas style
15 Apr 13:25 - Shaggy: Have you been to the one on shoreditch high st?

15 Apr 14:07 - Tegan: We're going today for sure
15 Apr 14:07 - Tegan: Sorry lorna
15 Apr 14:21 - Lorna: üòû
15 Apr 14:21 - Lorna: Enjoy!
15 Apr 14:53 - Bongo: Park first though?
15 Apr 15:08 - Shaggy: Definitely.
15 Apr 15:13 - Bongo: Which one?
15 Apr 15:14 - Bongo: <Media omitted>
15 Apr 15:14 - Bongo: I just got this in the mail, my name's been changed on the electoral register?
15 Apr 15:14 - Bongo: To what? Cornelius bigglesworth?
15 Apr 15:21 - Owen: Find out.  Maybe there's vote rigging afoot.
15 Apr 15:32 - Shaggy added Lora
15 Apr 15:37 - Hannah Murphy: After the last election I got a message saying my vote didn't count cos they didn't believe it was me!!! It was!!! Accused of fraud against myself...
15 Apr 15:37 - Tegan: We could hang out around granary square
15 Apr 15:38 - Tegan: fountains are nice and it stays sunny for ages
15 Apr 15:38 - Tegan: No head though
15 Apr 15:38 - Tegan: I'd be livid if I got a letter after the fact to say they'd discounted my vote! I wonder how many people that happened to
15 Apr 15:40 - Lorna: How do they know which vote is yours?
15 Apr 15:41 - Tegan: Good point. ..
15 Apr 15:41 - Hannah Murphy: It was a postal vote
15 Apr 15:41 - Hannah Murphy: So I had to sign
15 Apr 15:42 - Hannah Murphy: To prove 'twas me. Seems like I had fashionably revamped my signature or something
15 Apr 16:51 - Shaggy: So anyone up for sitting on the grass with a beverage of choice?
15 Apr 16:51 - Shaggy: Regents park is nice
15 Apr 16:51 - Shaggy: Justsayin
15 Apr 16:52 - Lora: Regents is sorta far-ish
15 Apr 16:52 - Lora: How about grass in front of Tate next to river?
15 Apr 16:54 - Shaggy: Sure, that's way closer for me
15 Apr 16:54 - Tegan: I think you should come to granary square and then come for dinner
15 Apr 16:55 - Tegan: My opinion
15 Apr 16:55 - Shaggy: That's like your opinion, man
15 Apr 16:55 - Lora: Dishoom? The q there is torture and they don't let you drink in it
15 Apr 16:56 - Tegan: I need one more person to agree to come so I can book a table
15 Apr 17:00 - Bongo: Just book it anyway
15 Apr 17:00 - Bongo: Worst case scenario we'll make a friend
15 Apr 17:00 - Bongo: And bring them in
15 Apr 17:01 - Tegan: God that's clever
15 Apr 17:01 - Tegan: fiendishly clever
15 Apr 17:05 - Tegan: They're not picking up now. ..
15 Apr 17:05 - Tegan: Might have missed the reservation window. ..
15 Apr 17:12 - Bongo: Bail and book it another day?
15 Apr 17:12 - Tegan: Nah, I think dave and Marth and xav and I will still grab dinner
15 Apr 17:13 - Tegan: See what the queue is like, or try somewhere Elgar
15 Apr 17:13 - Tegan: You know elgar
15 Apr 17:13 - Tegan: Come along if you fancy, it'll be dark by then
15 Apr 17:19 - Bongo: Elgar?! Thou knowest the feud betwixt our bloodlines runs deeper than the rivers of blood spilt between our peoples!
15 Apr 17:20 - Bongo: Yea, maybe I'll partake, I'll see how southbank fairs with shaggy
15 Apr 17:23 - Tegan: coo

15 Apr 17:27 - Lora: He said you're going to queen of hoxton lol
15 Apr 17:27 - Shaggy: What's the anchor?
15 Apr 17:28 - Lora: At the river dum dum
15 Apr 17:28 - Shaggy: Oh that place
15 Apr 17:28 - Shaggy: Just meet at the green
15 Apr 17:28 - Bongo: Which one? Outside the Tate?
15 Apr 17:29 - Shaggy: Ja

15 Apr 17:29 - Bongo: What about next to the eye?
15 Apr 17:30 - Shaggy: Also fine with me
15 Apr 17:32 - Lora: I feel the same about that building. Fine with jubilee gardens
15 Apr 18:00 - Shaggy: I'm heading over now, will be there in 20
15 Apr 18:02 - Bongo: Cool same
15 Apr 18:02 - Bongo: 20 mins also

17 Apr 07:26 - Sam Roberts: It determines your stats, and how people interact with you
17 Apr 07:26 - Sam Roberts: Self entitlement, chance of getting shot on sight, jumping etc etc

17 Apr 18:52 - Bongo: That was meant to be an exclamation mark
17 Apr 18:53 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: I think you're basing your opinion entirely on the poster you saw
17 Apr 18:53 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: I know three people who went, all said it was hilarious
17 Apr 18:53 - Tegan: The wrestling looks to be sold out
17 Apr 18:54 - Tegan: Which is a bit of a pity, but I guess predictable
17 Apr 18:55 - Tegan: Although if you guys want to ask if they're selling tickets on the door I might be interested - it does look pretty awesome :)

17 Apr 19:00 - Bongo: Maybe that's why
17 Apr 19:01 - Bongo: But then, I'm the kind of person who could watch a blank wall wasted and find it funny
17 Apr 19:02 - Alex Bunn: It IS so bad its good

18 Apr 12:22 - Owen: I'm gonna go with the second one.  Because it just seems like a string of random letters,  much like programming seems to me at the moment.
18 Apr 12:36 - Bongo: Yoji will make you program three times as fast
18 Apr 12:38 - Bongo: And probably make twice as many mistakes
18 Apr 12:45 - Owen: It's hellish bongo.

22 Apr 12:19 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: I asked my Chinese coworker
22 Apr 12:20 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: She says its a literal translation, sounds nicer in Chinese, just a poetic way to say 'please don't walk on the grass'
22 Apr 12:20 - Hannah Murphy: And the ladies loo has this funky contraption:

22 Apr 19:08 - Tegan: Can't make it tonight, but look forward to your reaction o & e
22 Apr 19:08 - Tegan: How was drawing along with Stubbs?

22 Apr 20:47 - Shaggy: What's the surname of the royal family?
22 Apr 20:48 - Sam Roberts: Windsor!!
22 Apr 20:48 - Dave: Like a painful fart
22 Apr 20:49 - Shaggy: Is it? I thought it's just the castle
22 Apr 20:50 - Sam Roberts: Ah I thought it was a trick
22 Apr 20:50 - Sam Roberts: Aren't they technically German?
22 Apr 20:51 - Shaggy: <Media omitted>
22 Apr 21:07 - Shaggy: <Media omitted>
22 Apr 21:35 - Sam Roberts: Mononyms
22 Apr 21:35 - Sam Roberts: Like Madonna
22 Apr 22:26 - Bongo: It's a conspiracy to hide the fact that the Mongols wiped out what is currently known as Western Europe
23 Apr 09:15 - Joe Jarman: üáΩüá™
23 Apr 09:15 - Joe Jarman: Happy st George
23 Apr 09:24 - Tegan: Racist
23 Apr 09:24 - Tegan: :)
23 Apr 09:34 - Joe Jarman: We should definitely get a day
23 Apr 09:34 - Joe Jarman: It's really unfair!!

23 Apr 12:41 - Alex Bunn: Sound advice shags
23 Apr 12:57 - Shaggy: It's a pub near me, I don't want to take credit for it
23 Apr 17:45 - Shaggy: Eliza, was it you who posted vote swap? Have you seen http://www.swapmyvote.uk? It's basically the same but more choices
23 Apr 17:46 - Angela: It was me - no I haven't seen that
23 Apr 17:46 - Shaggy: Ah sorry
23 Apr 17:46 - Shaggy: All women are the same
23 Apr 17:50 - Angela: It's a nice idea to include more parties, I wonder how many people use it
23 Apr 17:52 - Shaggy: 1000 so far

23 Apr 19:52 - Alex Bunn: Balls. I dont have my bike lock todayüò´
23 Apr 19:52 - Alex Bunn: Beers at home üçª?
23 Apr 19:53 - Sam Roberts: Beers at home! Just leaving kings kiss
23 Apr 19:55 - Alex Bunn: Gonna leave work in 10
23 Apr 20:44 - Steven: Become a contractor and for those last 3 hours you would have been paid!
23 Apr 20:52 - Sam Roberts: There's so much more than money ste
23 Apr 20:52 - Sam Roberts: Like, uh, job satisfaction?
23 Apr 20:52 - Sam Roberts: Lo
23 Apr 20:52 - Sam Roberts: Lol
23 Apr 22:33 - Steven: 3 hours extra = 3 hours job satisfaction + 3 hours extra pay -> best
23 Apr 22:36 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: My only problem with contracting is everyone where you work will be bitching about you
24 Apr 00:03 - Dave: Pretty sure they're bitching about you anyway mikr
24 Apr 00:03 - Dave: Mike
24 Apr 07:06 - Alex Bunn: Oooo. Burn
24 Apr 09:36 - Bongo: Yea contractors get auto-uninvited to everything
24 Apr 09:37 - Tegan: I really like my contractors. I just can't rely on them to do the work I've asked them to do.
24 Apr 09:37 - Tegan: Maybe I need new contractors....
24 Apr 09:37 - Bongo: Incompetent contractors don't count
24 Apr 09:38 - Tegan: I'm told they are very competent
24 Apr 09:39 - Tegan: They just can't do stuff as awesome as me
24 Apr 09:42 - Bongo: Go contracting tegs!
24 Apr 10:09 - Tegan: Spending my Friday in the cafe of a shiny 'club lab' workspace on the canal near westborne park
24 Apr 10:10 - Tegan: <Media omitted>
24 Apr 10:10 - Shaggy: Oh wow
24 Apr 10:10 - Shaggy: That's inspiring
24 Apr 10:10 - Dave: God
24 Apr 10:10 - Shaggy: Vb is my role model
24 Apr 10:10 - Tegan: Right?
24 Apr 10:11 - Dave: It's such a bland quote too
24 Apr 10:11 - Dave: She's clearly not tried to achieve creative prowess
24 Apr 10:11 - Dave: Or just not worked very hard on it
24 Apr 10:12 - Vanessa: What do you think of that workspace?
24 Apr 10:12 - Vanessa: Besides the quote
24 Apr 10:12 - Tegan: besides the quote, it sends shiny and new
24 Apr 10:12 - Tegan: Seems
24 Apr 10:12 - Vanessa: Yes they have spaces all over London
24 Apr 10:12 - Tegan: It's attached to the Nido, which has gym, foosball, etc
24 Apr 10:12 - Tegan: I don't understand who these entrepreneurs are
24 Apr 10:13 - Vanessa: Oh that's very clever of them
24 Apr 10:13 - Tegan: Who can afford this biz
24 Apr 10:14 - Vanessa: Some of the workspaces are super expensive and I feel the same, what start up can afford ¬£300+ a month
24 Apr 10:14 - Vanessa: But it's the potential network that you can connect to I guess that balances it out
24 Apr 10:14 - Tegan: Right? Also the coffee is less good than average
24 Apr 10:14 - Vanessa: That's is not good
24 Apr 10:15 - Tegan: I guess so - feels like a bit of a veneer to me
24 Apr 10:15 - Tegan: clever business model for the owners though
24 Apr 10:18 - Shaggy: Assuming you mean 300 per month per desk, I don't think that's expensive
24 Apr 10:19 - Tegan: It is if you're just starting out and you're paying rent somewhere
24 Apr 10:19 - Tegan: If you have something already established and have a source of income it's ok
24 Apr 10:21 - Vanessa: Yes that's what I mean by expensive
24 Apr 10:21 - Vanessa: Especially if you're just one person
24 Apr 10:22 - Shaggy: If you're talking about someone with no funds who needs a desk then of course, that's what the library is for. A startup will already have been invested in and for a few people that's good value for manly compared to an actual office
24 Apr 10:23 - Dave: I'm good value for manly
24 Apr 10:23 - Tegan: l I'll
24 Apr 10:23 - Tegan: I meant lol
24 Apr 10:23 - Vanessa: Workspaces offer flexibility compared to renting an actual space that is why people like them
24 Apr 10:23 - Tegan: That makes sense Shaggy - so that's why everyone is swaggering around here
24 Apr 10:23 - Tegan: They have 'investment'
24 Apr 10:24 - Shaggy: Flexibility is not the main point, if you want a flexible work space it's cheaper
24 Apr 10:28 - Vanessa: Flexibility is one of the main selling points for start ups. They don't want to have to go through the whole process of ordering Internet, buying a printer, being stuck in a contract of a year, etc
24 Apr 10:28 - Bongo: Lol @that quote, I'm in a similar workspace filled with silly quotes
24 Apr 10:28 - Vanessa: But there are many other reasons for workspaces
24 Apr 10:28 - Vanessa: A library doesn't offer what a workspace does for someone wanting to start a business
24 Apr 10:28 - Bongo: Worst one is probably "winning means you're willing to go longer, work longer and give more than anyone else" - vince Lombardi
24 Apr 10:29 - Vanessa: Which workspace are you in bongo?
24 Apr 10:29 - Tegan: lol
24 Apr 10:29 - Tegan: There are some hilarious ones in my office
24 Apr 10:29 - Tegan: I'll add to the inspirational quote library tomorrow
24 Apr 10:29 - Bongo: I'm in the royal exchange
24 Apr 10:29 - Tegan: No, wait, it's the weekend!
24 Apr 10:29 - Bongo: It's this transition consultancy near bank
24 Apr 10:30 - Vanessa: Never heard of that one
24 Apr 10:31 - Bongo: I got hooked up through Gs
24 Apr 10:31 - Shaggy: Exactly, so workspace is cheap compared to an office
24 Apr 10:31 - Vanessa: But that's what I said
24 Apr 10:31 - Vanessa: Cheap and flexible
24 Apr 10:32 - Shaggy: You said it's expensive
24 Apr 10:32 - Tegan: I love it when everyone is really agreeing, but they think they're arguing
24 Apr 10:32 - Vanessa: Yes it's expensive for many start ups
24 Apr 10:32 - Tegan: expensive if you have no money
24 Apr 10:32 - Vanessa: Exactly
24 Apr 10:32 - Shaggy: That's a dumb thing to say
24 Apr 10:32 - Tegan: Like so many things in life :)
24 Apr 10:32 - Tegan: You're a dumb thing to say
24 Apr 10:32 - Shaggy: Everything is expensive if you have no manly
24 Apr 10:32 - Tegan: lol
24 Apr 10:33 - Vanessa: And sometimes the initial phase is where a coworking space would work because you need to be surrounded by the right people
24 Apr 10:33 - Tegan: Dave's got some of that
24 Apr 10:33 - Vanessa: But you can't because you any afford it
24 Apr 10:34 - Shaggy: Anyway, I might well be in one of those in a few months
24 Apr 10:34 - Vanessa: How come?
24 Apr 10:35 - Shaggy: Have to move to new office, but don't have anywhere to go yet
24 Apr 10:35 - Vanessa: Look at Central Working
24 Apr 10:41 - Vanessa: But if I get a job at Wework then you'll have to sign up there
24 Apr 10:42 - Shaggy: Mateusz is already trying to convince me
24 Apr 10:42 - Shaggy: It's not my decision however
24 Apr 10:43 - Vanessa: Yes but you can still be influential
24 Apr 10:43 - Vanessa: In the decision making
24 Apr 10:43 - Shaggy: Throw my toys out of the pram
24 Apr 10:45 - Bongo: Put ketamine in the coffee jar
24 Apr 10:46 - Tegan: Will that help?
24 Apr 10:46 - Alex Bunn: "I love it when everyone is really agreeing, but they think they're arguing" - classic shaggy
24 Apr 10:46 - Alex Bunn: I know tegan said it. But suma shaggy up well
24 Apr 10:47 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: Shaggy : WFHPARTY
24 Apr 10:47 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: That would be cheap
24 Apr 10:51 - Tegan: funsies :)
24 Apr 12:33 - Owen: Smart phones ruined arguments with shaggy.
24 Apr 12:33 - Owen: They used to be so much fun, but now I can prove him wrong in seconds.
24 Apr 12:46 - Tegan: http://www.stylist.co.uk/life/the-most-popular-emojis-by-country-from-france-to-australia?utm_source=Emerald+Street&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=5613411_ES+240415&dm_i=25MN,3CBC3,GBZ2RB,BYY7Q,1
24 Apr 12:46 - Tegan: emoji research on a large scale

24 Apr 13:13 - Alex Bunn: Good headlines üòäüí©
24 Apr 13:23 - Tegan: Now I can't tell what nationality you are
24 Apr 13:23 - Shaggy: Britons?
24 Apr 13:24 - Tegan: Sorry, is that racist?
24 Apr 13:26 - Shaggy: I don't need smartphone to prove you wrong, Owen, just an egg
24 Apr 13:27 - Tegan: he he. Is that one of the defining moments of your life, Owen?
24 Apr 14:15 - Owen: Unfortunately so. That time I rescued a baby from a burning building is overshadowed by a small egg mishap.
24 Apr 18:09 - Bongo: <Media omitted>
24 Apr 18:27 - Owen: Hahahha
24 Apr 18:28 - Owen: Thats great
24 Apr 18:28 - Owen: üòÇüòÇüòÇ

24 Apr 18:34 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: are great, I don't know
24 Apr 18:38 - Bongo: I concur
24 Apr 18:38 - Bongo: Also, have you been messing around with autocorrect again shag?
24 Apr 18:38 - Bongo: "Pig, the dog, interviews Scarlett johansen"
24 Apr 18:38 - Bongo: I think it's actually legit this time
24 Apr 18:42 - Tegan: lol
25 Apr 13:08 - Alex Bunn: Currently at a boozy brunch in the city

25 Apr 13:39 - Alex Bunn: Awww yeah

25 Apr 13:39 - Alex Bunn: Moved on to the mimosas
25 Apr 13:40 - Sam Roberts: How late is it unlimited for? Could swing by in an hour or so!
25 Apr 13:49 - Shaggy: We can host bloody marys here, just need vodka and tomato juice üòÅ
25 Apr 13:53 - Alex Bunn: I dunno. Our sesh finishes at two
25 Apr 13:53 - Alex Bunn: 2 hour time limit
25 Apr 13:54 - Shaggy: Oh lol
25 Apr 13:54 - Shaggy: So it's not unlimited
25 Apr 13:56 - Alex Bunn: Its unlimited for two hours!
25 Apr 14:02 - Sam Roberts: That would be really bad for my health
25 Apr 14:02 - Sam Roberts: I'm in

27 Apr 14:56 - Bongo: Lol
27 Apr 14:56 - Bongo: You do realise the speed dating is individual, it's not going to be all four of us chatting up a girl
27 Apr 14:56 - Alex Bunn: We can be bad speed dates to make you look good by comparison
27 Apr 14:57 - Bongo: Oh I see what you mean
27 Apr 14:57 - Bongo: Yea awesome
27 Apr 15:01 - Owen: Hi,  I'm Owen, I have syphilis and like long walks in the abattoir.

27 Apr 15:14 - Alex Bunn: Done
27 Apr 15:14 - Bongo: Hi I'm Bunn, the best thing about living with my mum is that she lets me play computer games all day and doesn't complain about not washing myself
27 Apr 15:18 - Tegan: Sometimes I let her wash me
27 Apr 15:19 - Bongo: 10 points if you bring 3 toy dinosaurs with you and put them on your desk facing her
27 Apr 15:20 - Owen: To be fair if a girl did that to me that would be an instant win for her.
27 Apr 15:20 - Bongo: Yea true
27 Apr 15:20 - Owen: Swoon.
27 Apr 15:21 - Bongo: I think we're a lot nerdier than average though
27 Apr 15:22 - Owen: Nerdyness is kinda cool now though.
27 Apr 15:25 - Owen: Technology is in everyones pockets so not knowing how to use it is a bit meh.
27 Apr 15:26 - Owen: When we were younger it was nerds that could do computer stuff because no one else really used them. But now thats changed. It's the new version of being handy.

28 Apr 17:58 - Hannah Murphy: Krizia left?!?
28 Apr 17:59 - Hannah Murphy: I've got dins with my fam tonight but tell us how Kurt cobain is
28 Apr 18:00 - Shaggy: Kicked for inactivity

28 Apr 19:52 - Alex Bunn: Kurts dead fyi

28 Apr 19:56 - Bongo: Kritzia's alternate male ego

28 Apr 19:57 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: Lol, Kurt faked his death and went undercover disguised as a Mexican girl
28 Apr 19:58 - Bongo: The perfect cover
28 Apr 20:05 - Lorna: Damm guys you just ruined the film!

29 Apr 14:09 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: I just heard the worst joke ever
29 Apr 14:09 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: What are the 10 letters of the pirate alphabet?
29 Apr 14:11 - Joe Jarman: Arrrrggggh

29 Apr 14:13 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: R, I I, and the seven Cs

29 Apr 14:14 - Joe Jarman: That  is pretty shit
29 Apr 14:15 - Alex Bunn: Whats a pirates favourite crime?
29 Apr 14:15 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: Arrrrson?
29 Apr 14:15 - Alex Bunn: Yes
29 Apr 14:15 - Alex Bunn: Also, piracy
29 Apr 14:15 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: Haha
29 Apr 14:16 - Alex Bunn: Related: why does it take pirates so long to learn the alphabet?
29 Apr 14:17 - Alex Bunn: Because they spend years at "C"
29 Apr 14:18 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: <Media omitted>
29 Apr 14:18 - Joe Jarman: Why don't pirates go to strip clubs?
29 Apr 14:18 - Alex Bunn: Lol, why?
29 Apr 14:19 - Joe Jarman: Coz they already have all the booty!
29 Apr 14:19 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: I lol'd

29 Apr 14:25 - Joe Jarman: Hahaha
29 Apr 14:25 - Alex Bunn: I love that you've spent 5mins trying to find a pirate gag worth sharing
29 Apr 14:25 - Alex Bunn: üëç

29 Apr 14:40 - Lorna: Arrrrgos
29 Apr 14:41 - Shaggy: What's a pirate's favourite football team
29 Apr 14:43 - Alex Bunn: Arrrsenal?
29 Apr 14:45 - Shaggy: That's a trick question. They don't have time for such nonsense between raping and pillaging
29 Apr 16:48 - Owen: You're thinking of mongols
29 Apr 16:54 - Bongo: <Media omitted>
29 Apr 16:58 - Bongo: That's meant to be the expression of not being impressed
29 Apr 16:58 - Bongo: But, Mongol as they are, that could also be the look of rape and pillaging
29 Apr 17:01 - Dave: He's being raped in that very picture
29 Apr 17:02 - Dave: Just not a very impressive rape
29 Apr 17:03 - Mike Joyce: He's just seen and done it all
29 Apr 17:04 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: *them all
29 Apr 17:36 - Mike Joyce: No to him we are nearly it
29 Apr 17:44 - Alex Bunn: Yo who's coming for an LB beer?
29 Apr 18:17 - Shaggy: Got dinner plans
29 Apr 18:23 - Mike Joyce: No shaggy LB stands for legally binding...it cannot be refused
29 Apr 18:24 - Shaggy: A trick question, touch√©
29 Apr 18:27 - Mike Joyce: Your mistake was being born....you technically entered the contract at that point.
29 Apr 18:29 - Bongo: That's the conservative political slogan for poor people
29 Apr 18:32 - Mike Joyce: Ha ha....Allong with classic ones like "you are all my slaves" and surrender your children unto bielzibub
29 Apr 18:34 - Joe Jarman: Been and gone, check you on the flipside
29 Apr 18:34 - Joe Jarman: üáßüá∑üöóüë±.......üöì

30 Apr 12:43 - Dave: So close...

1 May 08:50 - Shaggy: #boardgames4lyf
1 May 08:51 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: In seriousness I might be up for board games
1 May 09:39 - Bongo: That was a quick turnaround
1 May 09:40 - Alex Bunn: <Media omitted>
1 May 09:40 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: I like sassing Owen more than I like board games
1 May 09:45 - Owen: You know how to turn me on.
1 May 09:45 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: wat
1 May 11:38 - Alex Bunn: Grooveshark shut down apaz. Frontpage reddit
1 May 11:51 - Bongo: I've only just noticed the Asian emoji
1 May 11:51 - Bongo: üë≤
1 May 11:51 - Bongo: That's so mega racist
1 May 11:52 - Owen: üë≥
1 May 11:55 - Tegan: is it more racist to depict an Asian, or to not have an option for Asian people who want to express themselves as emoji?
1 May 11:55 - Tegan: Asians are not the prophet mohammed
1 May 11:56 - Tegan: I don't really feel adequately represented by this lady üôé
1 May 11:58 - Shaggy: üëπ this represents me well
1 May 12:00 - Bongo: It's the slanted eyes that makes it racist though
1 May 12:01 - Bongo: Also where's the black emoji?
1 May 12:02 - Bongo: I bet they were like "okay so for the other races we have a different skin colour and something distinguishable about the race, so what distinguishing feature about black people should we include on the emoji..."
1 May 12:03 - Alex Bunn: üí© here's the black guy
1 May 12:04 - Alex Bunn: Oh no he dint!
1 May 12:04 - Shaggy: There are actually new emoji that include all shades of white
1 May 12:05 - Shaggy: And lol @ bunn's comment
1 May 12:09 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: Emoji were set by the japanese
1 May 12:09 - Bongo: Ah, they hate black people more than anyone
1 May 12:10 - Owen: Wow.  There isn't a black emoji!
1 May 12:10 - Bongo: That makes üë≤marginally less racist
1 May 12:10 - Bongo: But what about üåö
1 May 12:11 - Jimena: üë≤ doesnt have slanted eyes. What makes u think he is chinese?
1 May 12:12 - Bongo: And I feel üë®is misrepresenting pesos everywhere
1 May 12:12 - Jimena: üë≤üèø
1 May 12:12 - Bongo: *pedos
1 May 12:12 - Bongo: The eyes are narrowed
1 May 12:12 - Bongo: You have to look real close
1 May 12:13 - Alex Bunn: He's squinting!
1 May 12:13 - Alex Bunn: Thats the squinting emoji
1 May 12:13 - Bongo: Plus the cap is a traditional Chinese hat
1 May 12:13 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: Japan definitely hate China
1 May 12:13 - Jimena: Tourist?
1 May 12:13 - Bongo: That's definitely a possibility
1 May 12:14 - Bongo: "Squinting tourist"
1 May 12:14 - Bongo: Although that's rather specific for an emoji
1 May 12:14 - Jimena: Lol
1 May 12:14 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: Do emoji look the same on Android / iPhone?
1 May 12:14 - Bongo: If they have "squinting tourist" why the hell don't that have Asian people?!
1 May 12:14 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: <Media omitted>
1 May 12:15 - Bongo: Yea looks the same to me
1 May 12:16 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: I don't know who makes the pictures, like there's those weird yellow blob ones on some apps
1 May 12:16 - Jimena: Noo looks different
1 May 12:16 - Jimena: How do u make screen shots
1 May 12:16 - Bongo: Do you have an iPhone?
1 May 12:17 - Jimena: Yeah
1 May 12:17 - Bongo: Top right button and centre circle button at the same time
1 May 12:17 - Bongo: <Media omitted>
1 May 12:18 - Jimena: <Media omitted>
1 May 12:18 - Owen: Hahaha
1 May 12:18 - Bongo: Wtf!
1 May 12:18 - Owen: That's creepy as fuck.
1 May 12:19 - Jimena: My black squinting touris is an asian and an alien for martyn..
1 May 12:19 - Bongo: Lol wait a second
1 May 12:19 - Bongo: Yea lol
1 May 12:20 - Jimena: Kudos to u for asking if we are all seeing the same thing
1 May 12:20 - Jimena: That was a real philosophic move
1 May 12:20 - Bongo: Your Asian dude doesn't have slanted eyes as well
1 May 12:20 - Jimena: üëçüèø
1 May 12:20 - Bongo: It is very philosophic
1 May 12:21 - Bongo: Maybe in real life some people don't see black people, but an Asian dude with an alien standing next to him
1 May 12:21 - Jimena: Btw that emoji is meant to be a black thumbs up
1 May 12:21 - Bongo: That would explain a lot of the racial hate that's been going on
1 May 12:22 - Jimena: But maybe ur phone is reading it as a a penis and an alien
1 May 12:22 - Bongo: Don't worry it's a thumbs up and an alien
1 May 12:23 - Jimena: üí© and this one is an ice cream
1 May 12:48 - Alex Bunn: So naive
1 May 12:51 - Tegan: Wow.  IPhone Asian is bright yellow!
1 May 12:51 - Tegan: I think Android asian is an improvement.  even with the slanted eyes
1 May 12:53 - Angela: http://fueled.com/blog/new-racially-diverse-emoji-will-create-controversy-solve/
1 May 12:54 - Angela: iPhone has all the emoji of the rainbow on ios8.3
1 May 12:54 - Angela: And lots of emoji are different it turns out!
1 May 12:55 - Angela: http://m.huffpost.com/us/entry/5530638
1 May 12:55 - Angela: On android I mean
1 May 13:10 - Alex Bunn: Good research
1 May 13:14 - Shaggy: As Colbert said: "I don't see race anymore, I just imagine everyone is white and everything ok"
1 May 13:16 - Alex Bunn: Everythink ok indeed
1 May 13:16 - Alex Bunn: Word good
1 May 16:46 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: Ran my emoji code again
1 May 16:46 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: <Media omitted>
1 May 16:46 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: Hannah and Owen and their shenanigans
1 May 16:46 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: Also while I'm at it, sorry Bunn I've overtaken you
1 May 16:47 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: <Media omitted>
1 May 16:49 - Owen: What is the second one Mike?
1 May 16:50 - Lorna: How gay you are?
1 May 16:57 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: Woops
1 May 16:58 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: <Media omitted>
1 May 16:58 - Alex Bunn: Its ok. Iv moved onto witty puns
1 May 16:58 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: I'm pretty sure if Adimina had stuck around she would have doubled the record with selfies alone
1 May 17:05 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: Quiz question : how many posts do you reckon there have been on this group?
1 May 17:05 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: Multiple posts in a row from one person count as 1
1 May 17:05 - Owen: 15,000
1 May 17:10 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: Damn close. This is the 15,556th post
1 May 17:19 - Owen: Nice.
1 May 17:20 - Tegan: When did Owen and Hannah have their brass instrument off?
1 May 17:26 - Alex Bunn: I was thinking that!
1 May 17:27 - Bongo: Lol I'd pay to see that
1 May 17:50 - Shaggy: Any beer plan tonight?
1 May 18:33 - Tegan: negatory- boating tonight
1 May 19:40 - Lorna: So what's the deal with brunch places doing unlimited bloody Marys? Anyone know a good one? And want to go sometime soon?
1 May 22:06 - Dave: Don't know. No. Yes.
2 May 17:33 - Tegan: While festival shopping, Dave just applied the logic: what would Bunn do?
2 May 17:34 - Tegan: You should be proud, man
2 May 18:14 - Dave: We got a load of rum
4 May 11:57 - Alex Bunn: Haha awesome
5 May 10:37 - Lorna: Is anyone planning to stay up and watch the election results? Sick days on Friday!
5 May 10:40 - Tegan: we did that last time when there was likely to be a hung parliament
5 May 10:40 - Tegan: Long night
5 May 10:42 - Lorna: Worth it? There's pubs staying open, and serving early breakfasts..
5 May 10:43 - Owen: The counting lasted until about 10 the next morning last time. I will probably just wake up and pay attention to it during the day.
5 May 13:41 - Dave: I'm thinking the same. Hung parliament and hungover doesn't sound like a good friday
5 May 13:51 - Tegan: What time does the coverage start though?  I'm up for ending the evening in a left leaving pub for sure
5 May 13:51 - Tegan: seeing how things stand at bed o clock
5 May 14:10 - Lorna: Voting closes at 10, and counting starts straight after that, not sure when the first results come in though
5 May 14:12 - Lorna: Also, hoping the pub will not be left leaving at the end of the night!
5 May 15:37 - Tegan: Now that I look at it, I'm really not sure what that would mean. .
5 May 16:06 - Shaggy: I assume you wanted to type "leaning"
5 May 16:36 - Tegan: Thanks shags
5 May 19:17 - Dan Sluckin: I was hoping to find a bar that is showing coverage, perhaps with a swingometer. Is there anywhere central?
5 May 19:18 - Dan Sluckin: Westminster?
5 May 19:18 - Shaggy: Probably inside
5 May 19:30 - Owen: Let's make our own swingometer
5 May 21:07 - Jimena: <Media omitted>
5 May 21:11 - Dave: ‚ò∫
6 May 10:18 - Jimena: So im making a sort of app with a wheel of fortune type thing. The idea is it should be something u could have up on a screen in a pub. Customer pays say 2 quid and gets to have a spin
6 May 10:19 - Jimena: My question is what should the different wheel outcomes be?
6 May 10:20 - Jimena: I was thinking for example 'Headshot: you get the nastiest shot in the bar'
6 May 10:21 - Jimena: 'Showtime: bartenders perform some silly dance song'
6 May 10:21 - Jimena: Any ideas? I feel quite uninspired
6 May 10:23 - Shaggy: It's too early in the morning, I think I need a couple headshots for inspiration
6 May 10:34 - Jimena: Really? Cuz the nastiest shot i ever had was an Abortion: vodka and tabasco. Shall i get u a couple?
6 May 10:41 - Bongo: Surely that's just a mini Bloody Mary
6 May 10:41 - Bongo: I'm up for that
6 May 10:41 - Shaggy: Ugh shot if vodka, no thanks
6 May 10:42 - Bongo: Pretty much all the options are going to be about drinking right?
6 May 10:42 - Bongo: How about, "designated driver downs 4 pints"
6 May 10:43 - Bongo: Or everyone with their first name starting with the person who spun the wheel takes a shot
6 May 10:47 - Bongo: Oh wait these are meant to be rewarding for the person spinning
6 May 11:34 - Tegan: Dares are quite good
6 May 11:34 - Tegan: 'Get yourself thrown out of the pub'
6 May 11:35 - Tegan: or scavenger hunt type ones
6 May 11:35 - Tegan: 'Steal a suit's wallet, then buy your friends a drink'
6 May 11:52 - Sam Roberts: I like the mix... Some to get you drunk, some to get you happy, some to get you arrested
6 May 11:53 - Sam Roberts: Needs a jackpot... Win a bottle of wine?
6 May 11:53 - Sam Roberts: New Andreya Triana album out btw, real soulful
6 May 11:54 - Sam Roberts: Oh, if it's a commercial app, should have a pretty boring set as standard, with a content editor tool so pubs can set their own
6 May 11:55 - Sam Roberts: You could probably buy a set of standard graphics to cut out a huge amount of work, e.g. Fireworks on jackpot
6 May 13:10 - Pete Morey: Give ppl a set of icons that they have to draw on their own/each other's hands.  Then you can use those icons on the wheel to preface any 'nominate'  type activity.  Gives an extra interactive element which would work in a pub. I've used similar idea in comedy with a projector + basic frame animation scrolling through the icons.
6 May 13:18 - Owen: Release a pack of wild wolves into the pub and lock the doors, the last person alive gets a free pint.
6 May 13:19 - Shaggy: Of blood
6 May 13:24 - Bongo: That's more of a five quid wheel than two
6 May 13:25 - Owen: You're right bongo. Let's replace the wolves with geese.
6 May 13:26 - Bongo: "Spinner has to become a leader of a cult and sacrifice and overthrow any government of their choosing"
6 May 13:38 - Tegan: spinner could decide what animal gets released into the pub
6 May 13:39 - Tegan: wolves is like the ¬£20 bonus question
6 May 13:39 - Tegan: other options could be guinea pigs, starlings, spiders
6 May 14:28 - Pete Morey: Hehehe
6 May 17:20 - Jimena: Thank you all for your fantastic suggestions. I had a good laugh reading them
6 May 17:23 - Jimena: The website/app is mot a commercial project. Just a project to add to a little portfolio immaking  to apply for jobs in web development
6 May 17:27 - Jimena: I figured that my combo of degrees in philosophy and education plus my teaching experience wouldnt do the trick
6 May 17:28 - Jimena: Despite some very eloquent motivation letters üò¢
6 May 17:43 - Bongo: Sounds cool, is it a mobile app or web app?
6 May 17:45 - Jimena: Web
6 May 17:45 - Jimena: In javascript
6 May 17:47 - Bongo: We have a coding group on here if you want to join, for any questions, most of us have experience with front end dev
6 May 17:47 - Bongo: I'm pretty new to front end dev myself so it's been really handy
6 May 17:49 - Jimena: Oooh yes please
6 May 17:50 - Jimena: Im pretty new to the whole shebang: wrote my first line of code last dec
6 May 17:51 - Bongo: Ossum, you're probably much better than me in that case
6 May 17:57 - Jimena: Thankyouuuüòé
7 May 07:38 - Dave: Election day! üçÜ
7 May 07:39 - Dave: Did anyone at canning town find my polling card? It was on the fridge when it first arrived then vanished
7 May 08:18 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: Can't see it sorry man, I remember seeing someone's card on the floor, but I'm 99% sure it was Bunn or Sam's
7 May 07:45 - Angela: I don't think you need it
7 May 07:46 - Dave: Having checked it seems i don't. Still would have liked to wave it around.
7 May 07:47 - Alex Bunn: Dont need it
7 May 07:47 - Alex Bunn: Voted üôå
7 May 07:48 - Dave: üëèüåΩ
7 May 07:59 - Owen: Anti-hype
7 May 08:00 - Owen: Go hung parliament! That thing that was meant to happen if we voted AV
7 May 08:01 - Tegan: and then that thing that happened in Belgium where they didn't have a government for the best part of a year
7 May 08:05 - Lorna: Yeah but that's Belgium for you
7 May 08:05 - Owen: To busy eating waffles amiright. Vote UKIP!!
7 May 08:06 - Tegan: They were a'ight
7 May 08:06 - Lorna: Do I get a veg emoji for having just voted?
7 May 08:08 - Tegan: üçç
7 May 08:08 - Tegan: fruit?
7 May 08:09 - Lorna: I'll take that!
7 May 08:11 - Tegan: Have you guys had to queue?
7 May 08:19 - Hannah Murphy: I was tempted to vote for my local "cannabis is safer than alcohol" party but I thought the logo (cannabis leaf) was a bit naff
7 May 08:34 - Angela: Eerily quiet at my polling station, I was the only one in there for a while.... #awkwardvoting
7 May 08:34 - Angela: Should I stay here for a while, read the whole list to make it seem like I'm thinking about it...?
7 May 08:35 - Shaggy: No it would look like you haven't given it thought before
7 May 08:36 - Angela: It's lose-lose for me really
7 May 08:37 - Angela: Can I get a veg now?!
7 May 08:38 - Owen: Vote tactically.
7 May 08:38 - Tegan: üçí
7 May 08:54 - Shaggy: Veg me
7 May 08:56 - Dave: üçÖ
7 May 09:12 - Martha: I voted by postal vote - hoping what happened to Hannah last election doesn't happen to me.
7 May 09:13 - Angela: What happened
7 May 09:18 - Martha: Got a letter afterwards saying her vote didn't count because they didn't believe it was her
7 May 09:19 - Angela: That's so weird. Why wouldn't they?
7 May 09:22 - Martha: Dunno - signature looked a bit different maybe.
7 May 09:41 - Hannah Murphy: I'm creative with my signature every time it would seem
7 May 09:43 - Hannah Murphy: Don't be creative Martha!
7 May 09:43 - Angela: And yet you don't have to show ID when you go and vote...
7 May 09:45 - Tegan: Because you have an address! What greater measure is there??
7 May 10:48 - Tegan: veg!
7 May 10:50 - Shaggy: üêì
7 May 11:50 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: Yikes I didn't realise it was so close
7 May 11:51 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: Ladbrokes odds on who will be next PM: Cameron 10/11, Miliband 10/11
7 May 12:16 - Owen: Owen?

8 May 07:34 - Angela: As soon as he stops sobbing long enough to appear on camera probably
8 May 07:36 - Hannah Murphy: Even if labour had all of the snp's seats, they wouldn't have made a majority

8 May 08:47 - Joe Jarman: Why didn't they just fuck off????
8 May 08:47 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: Bye bye EU?
8 May 08:47 - Joe Jarman: Unbelievable
8 May 08:47 - Tegan: and campaign for independence with them
8 May 08:47 - Joe Jarman: How they vote
8 May 08:47 - Tegan: shit.  referendum
8 May 08:47 - Tegan: shiiiiiiiiit
8 May 08:48 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: I would put money on leaving EU now
8 May 08:48 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: Shiiiiiiit indeed
8 May 08:49 - Shaggy: Only stupid ukip supporters want to leave eu
8 May 08:54 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: I don't think people hate being in the EU, anti-immigration is at a high though
8 May 08:54 - Tegan: Loads of people are stupid
8 May 08:58 - Shaggy: True dat
8 May 08:59 - Shaggy: Did you know 50% of people have iq below average?
8 May 09:01 - Hannah Murphy: Ah well, labour got 5 years to find a decent enough leader to pit against boris Johnson
8 May 09:08 - Tegan: Fancy it Hannah?
8 May 09:28 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: Fucking hell the lib dems too
8 May 09:28 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: I don't know if Clegg can resign
8 May 09:28 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: Who can replace him?
8 May 09:30 - Owen: It really probably doesn't make much difference. Milliband had bought into Cameron's cut everything rhetoric anyway,  so even if he got into power we'd still have a bunch of cuts.
8 May 09:32 - Martha: <Media omitted>
8 May 09:33 - Owen: We need someone like Tony Benn. What happened to politicians like him.
8 May 09:34 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: Owen, what Miliband rhetoric are you talking about?
8 May 09:35 - Owen: Cameron's cut everything rhetoric.
8 May 09:36 - Owen: Milliband bought into it. The debates between them were basically them just promising to cut everything except the NHS
8 May 09:36 - Owen: So if labour got in we'd also just have more "austerity"
8 May 09:43 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: He said that about 2015-2016 I think?
8 May 09:44 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: Nothing long term
8 May 09:44 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: Mad fact - UKIP got twice as many votes as SNP
8 May 09:44 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: 3 million people
8 May 09:45 - Owen: We really need PR. Even if it does mean UKIP get more seats, facts like that just make a mockery of our fptp system.

8 May 13:32 - Bongo: Congrats dude! Sounds like an awesome opportunity
8 May 13:39 - Jimena: Switzerland officially the happiest country on Earth - with Britain lagging in 21st place - The Independent - http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/switzerland-officially-the-happiest-country-on-earth--with-britain-lagging-in-21st-place-10221591.html?cmpid=whatsapp
8 May 13:40 - Jimena: üòÅ
8 May 13:41 - Jimena: Clearly you should all move here.
8 May 13:41 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: 21 out of 158 ain't bad!
8 May 13:41 - Joe Jarman: Most boring country
8 May 13:42 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: Most obnoxious Horde member today üòõ
8 May 13:43 - Joe Jarman: ‚ò∫‚ò∫‚ò∫‚ò∫ so proud
8 May 13:43 - Owen: Over the past three years, 51 per cent of categories measured ‚Äì which included people‚Äôs happiness with their work, health, material wellbeing, relationships, social support and local environment ‚Äìhad improved or shown no change.
8 May 13:44 - Joe Jarman: üèÜ
8 May 13:44 - Owen: This is the kind of subtle propaganda that got Cameron a majority.
8 May 13:44 - Owen: That means 49% of areas happiness went down.
8 May 13:45 - Owen: It doesn't say how many showed no change.
8 May 13:45 - Owen: So it could be 0% happier, 51% no change, and 49% less happy.
8 May 13:45 - Owen: Fuck you independent!
8 May 13:47 - Joe Jarman: I don't think so, it doesn't factor in fear of Scottish people anywhere
8 May 13:51 - Jimena: Tough crowd üòû
8 May 13:51 - Owen: Sorry.
8 May 13:52 - Owen: The newspapers in general have been driving me nuts in the lead up to the election.
8 May 13:54 - Owen: As soon as election season happens, when the papera should try their best to be objective seems to be the time they decide to unashamedly just smear propaganda in your face. No wonder Cameron got a majority, all but one of the major newspapers explicitly supported him.
8 May 13:55 - Joe Jarman: I like your article jimena üòä
8 May 14:03 - Joe Jarman: I bet david likes it too üòç
8 May 14:05 - Hannah Murphy: Anybody looking for a Chinese man ticket?
8 May 14:15 - Jimena: Whatever political propaganda opportunities david or others see in it, it doesnt take away that it is nice to be right at the top of a list that includes 3 nordic countries and canada.
8 May 14:16 - Jimena: üá®üá≠hop suisse!
8 May 14:20 - Tegan: Well done Switzerland!
8 May 14:21 - Tegan: (Have that, Sweden!)
8 May 14:21 - Pete Morey: I gotta say,  I felt the classy civilisation seeping in to my grubby British pores when I visited ye Jim.  That and the cheese.
8 May 14:22 - Owen: I don't have a problem with a happiness report. Just the way the independent covered it.
8 May 14:22 - Tegan: cheese pores
8 May 14:22 - Tegan: mmmmmm
8 May 14:35 - Bongo: Hear hear Owen, shameless propaganda leading up to the election
8 May 14:35 - Bongo: Campaign adverts that imply things that completely contradict the party's policies
8 May 14:35 - Bongo: But it's always been like that
8 May 14:36 - Bongo: Political leaders are becoming like zaphod beeblebrox
8 May 14:38 - Owen: In America money wins elections, in Britain newspapers win elections. I'm not sure which I would prefer, but they are both shit.
8 May 14:44 - Pete Morey: This could be gd critical side-reading to the happiness report.  Ie Is it a good thing in itself to bring wellbeing into policy-tool territory,  where,  once it becomes measurable,  it becomes malleable both in a good and bad way...  (whatever 'it'  is) :

http://www.theguardian.com/media/2015/may/07/how-friendship-became-tool-of-powerful
8 May 14:58 - Owen: However it's used I would rather have a happiness number used to measure progress than the deficit.
8 May 15:13 - Pete Morey: Yeah me too!
8 May 15:26 - Martha: Unfortunately gdp and deficit tell the gov and its lenders how reliably it will be able to pay off its loans. If risk goes up the interest rate can go up or the number of investors can go down, likely leaving the government with less in its purse to spend on welfare services. So deficit and gdp have an indirect impact on progress in that way at least.
8 May 15:27 - Martha: But yes, if you want to measure actual progress and welfare you should look at another indicator, I'm just saying you can't disregard it completely.
8 May 15:29 - Tegan: Let's have lots of indicators
8 May 15:29 - Tegan: much more interesting modeling
8 May 15:30 - Pete Morey: :D
8 May 15:33 - Pete Morey: But highlighting the dangers/limits of wellbeing-as-economic-indicator seems important because it is the most easily co-opted (ie ppl can be duped into following the feel good factor more easily, by a political leader who may be pursuing a darker agenda).
8 May 15:36 - Steven: There are no academic studies to indicate a relationship between financial or media backing and election success. The money and media support flow to the people and parties most likely to win rather than the other way round. There are academic studies that show that relationship.
8 May 15:40 - Pete Morey: That's analogous to what the editor of the Sun said on TV yesterday about their editorial policy in Scotland and England. He seemed like quite a calm,  reasonable and balanced man compared to his headlines,  which somehow directly supported his general point.
8 May 15:41 - Lorna: I agree with your point about money and elections. But with papers I'm not so sure. Murdoch has it in for the labour party, and he controls the majority of the media.
8 May 15:43 - Lorna: ...of the papers anyway. The conservative campaign was strengthened by the argument that labour overspent and would put us back in a recession.
8 May 15:44 - Lorna: That has no factual basis, but it was what Murdoch was reporting. And people will be influenced by that
8 May 17:31 - Steven: This is the only paper I believe.

8 May 17:55 - Sam Roberts: Thanks, made me laugh
8 May 17:56 - Sam Roberts: "Socialism is great in theory, but in practice it‚Äôs a massive ball-ache"
8 May 18:00 - Mike Joyce: Ha ha
8 May 19:09 - Alex Bunn: Joe's inner bastard overflows to his outside
8 May 19:22 - Bongo: It works in small groups with common principles
8 May 19:23 - Bongo: Like the horde, can we just go live on a mountainside somewhere and leave all of this?
8 May 19:39 - Sam Trundell: Like Sweden
8 May 19:59 - Bongo: But we'll call it.. Bongdom
8 May 20:34 - Shaggy: Shangdom
8 May 21:35 - Alex Bunn: Got drunk. Am cycling home. A classic
9 May 21:46 - Shaggy: <Media omitted>
10 May 11:30 - Owen: Blargh guys, blargh.
10 May 11:30 - Owen: I do not remember last night.
10 May 11:31 - Owen: I think I was a bit of a buffoon though.
10 May 11:31 - Owen: Can anyone who was more sober than me offer any insight?
10 May 11:44 - Bongo: Lol you were just happy
10 May 11:44 - Bongo: No particular buffoonery
10 May 11:44 - Owen: I think I said some bad stuff.
10 May 11:44 - Bongo: You were very close to arguing with the bouncers for not being able to take our drink out of the club though
10 May 11:44 - Owen: Really?
10 May 11:45 - Bongo: Yea it's cool though I was just like "bad owen!"
10 May 11:45 - Owen: Oh god. Arguing with emptiers is never a good idea.
10 May 11:45 - Bongo: Haha yea
10 May 11:45 - Owen: Did I try kissing any of you. I think I was in a particularly kissy mood.
10 May 11:46 - Owen: ?
10 May 11:46 - Bongo: lol not me
10 May 11:48 - Owen: Did I reveal any personal information?
10 May 12:23 - Lora: Who loves discooooo? http://www.residentadvisor.net/event.aspx?709077
10 May 12:47 - Bongo: You did mention that one time you took it up the bum and liked it
10 May 12:47 - Bongo: Don't worry we won't tell Eliza
10 May 12:54 - Shaggy: Going to scruff the following night, so I'll probably miss the disco
10 May 13:05 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: Red Arrows fuck yeaaah Óîê

10 May 14:36 - Owen: Bumblebeeee!!!
10 May 14:56 - Sam Roberts: Crazy awesome
10 May 15:47 - Alex Bunn: I am here
10 May 16:03 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: Just in Sainsbury's
10 May 17:47 - Bongo: Wow, haven't been down brick lane in she's
10 May 17:48 - Bongo: *ages
10 May 17:48 - Bongo: Good to know it's still as barmey as always
10 May 17:48 - Tegan: That place be kray
10 May 17:50 - Bongo: I feel really under dressed
10 May 17:50 - Dave: walk on your hands
10 May 17:50 - Bongo: And outnumbered by selfie sticks
10 May 17:51 - Dave: Be ahead of the times - everyone will be doing it soon
10 May 17:51 - Bongo: Lol good call Dave
10 May 17:51 - Bongo: Wish I had thought of that
10 May 17:51 - Dave: That's why you have me
10 May 17:51 - Dave: *cries at the futility of life*
10 May 18:25 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: <Media omitted>
10 May 18:28 - Owen: <Media omitted>
10 May 18:30 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: Mine was better
10 May 18:32 - Owen: I name mine "the despondent mike contemplates his own mortality"
10 May 18:36 - Owen: I call this "sippin' on gin and juice (tonic)"
10 May 18:38 - Owen: <Media omitted>
10 May 18:55 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: Truce lol
10 May 18:55 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: That one of you was funny doe
10 May 19:02 - Shaggy: I'm talking about something really animatedly
10 May 19:41 - Alex Bunn: <Media omitted>
10 May 19:41 - Alex Bunn: <Media omitted>
10 May 19:43 - Tegan: lol
10 May 19:43 - Tegan: Sorry I missed the party y'all
10 May 19:43 - Tegan: Much love to Martita on her birthdita
10 May 19:44 - Tegan: (That's how girls have birthdays in Spanish)
10 May 19:44 - Tegan: x
10 May 19:44 - Owen: It sounds like you are calling Martha a tit.
10 May 20:07 - Hannah Murphy: Tegan - that photo of you bouncing!!!!
10 May 20:07 - Hannah Murphy: I think that's my favourite thing!!
10 May 20:08 - Owen: Hovering.
10 May 20:08 - Owen: Tegan doesn't bounce or jump, she hovers
10 May 20:32 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: She farted
11 May 05:56 - Tegan: it is an amazing thing
11 May 05:57 - Tegan: It is possible that I farted
11 May 10:40 - Bongo: Lol such a good photo
11 May 10:41 - Bongo: I wish I could guff into shot like that
11 May 10:44 - Owen: Should you write not applicable as "na" or "n/a"
11 May 10:45 - Owen: I see it written as "n/a" a lot. But that makes no sense as surely that means not/applicable
11 May 10:51 - Bongo: N/a, I know what you mean it should really be n.a.
11 May 10:52 - Bongo: Na just sounds like a colloquial no
11 May 10:52 - Bongo: Naaaaaaa I mean
11 May 10:53 - Owen: N/a is a tautology. Its either applicable or its not.
11 May 10:53 - Owen: üòÑ
11 May 10:53 - Owen: Not or applicable.
11 May 10:53 - Owen: ! ||==
11 May 10:53 - Owen: Lol nerd bants!
11 May 11:03 - Bongo: Wait I thought n/a is saying that it's definitely not applicable
11 May 11:05 - Owen: That's what it's meant to be.
11 May 11:05 - Owen: But the slash completely changes its meaning. A slash normally means or. E.g. Male/female.
11 May 11:06 - Owen: So n/a is almost like it's saying not or applicable, which is nonsense, or hilarious.
11 May 11:22 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: I sometimes write o/w and w/e for otherwise and whatever
11 May 11:22 - Shaggy: w/ means with, while w/o means without
11 May 11:25 - Owen: I have seen w/o i don't think I have seen w/
11 May 11:34 - Eliza: Slash doesn't always mean "or". It can just be used to separate first letters in abbreviations. E.g. n/a w/ w/r/t
11 May 11:40 - Owen: Thats silly, but I am pretty sure you are correct. I just didn't want to look like an idiot writing kids reports with n/a in them.
11 May 11:42 - Eliza: It's no sillier than 1/2 meaning half not 1 or 2. Slash can be different things.
11 May 11:44 - Bongo: Wo wo wo, fractions are a whole different ball game
11 May 11:45 - Owen: Oh I see n/a means "not divided by applicable"
11 May 11:45 - Eliza: Now you've got it!
11 May 11:45 - Bongo: Which in most cases is equal to 3
11 May 11:45 - Owen: Except in the case where it's not
11 May 11:48 - Pete Morey: <Media omitted>
11 May 11:49 - Owen: Haha, I love that cartoon.
11 May 11:50 - Bongo: Lol
11 May 11:55 - Owen: The only thing missing is that the plane then crashes into London killing thousands.
11 May 11:55 - Owen: Gove was worse than incompetent, he was anti-competent.
11 May 11:56 - Owen: If he was incompetent then nothing would have been done, he actively tried his best to put the education system back 20 years.
11 May 12:43 - Lorna: Which means that now he's minister for justice, they'll be hangings.
11 May 12:46 - Bongo: Is he? Ha
11 May 12:47 - Pete Morey: Yup: top priority for Gove= get rid of those pesky human rights
11 May 12:52 - Sam Trundell: Theresa May is already on it
11 May 12:56 - Martha: Thanks for yesterday guapos! Excellent video war. And cake. Excellent cake.
11 May 13:05 - Bongo: Cheers chica, awesome party
11 May 14:05 - Shaggy: Yeah why the hell is that about human rights?
11 May 14:57 - Dave: Hype?
11 May 14:58 - Sam Roberts: Hype!
11 May 14:59 - Shaggy: Hype¬°
11 May 15:12 - Joe Jarman: There's a bunch of lazy socialists lying around at home, hopefully they'll clean up before the providers get home and get those coals black lit!
11 May 15:15 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: I think Niall's getting well into it
11 May 15:15 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: He said he bought steaks and chicken wings
11 May 15:16 - Joe Jarman: üëçüëç
11 May 15:17 - Joe Jarman: Download 1080p!
11 May 15:17 - Joe Jarman: Those chicken wings are worth their weight in gold! Gold I tell thee
11 May 15:18 - Joe Jarman: üëëüçóüëëüçóüëë
11 May 18:11 - Alex Bunn: Hyped
11 May 18:11 - Alex Bunn: Dragons and boobs!
11 May 18:14 - Bongo: Draboobs
11 May 18:50 - Shaggy: I prefer the term boogons
11 May 18:51 - Martha: Heading over now. Anyone there yet?
11 May 18:52 - Sam Roberts: As yis
11 May 18:52 - Sam Roberts: And ready chica
11 May 18:52 - Martha: Sheeeeeet. There as soon as my little legs can peddle me xx
11 May 18:55 - Pete Morey: Shhheeeiiittt...  Omw what times za shew?  Got jerk pork 4 grill
11 May 19:00 - Sam Roberts: Get over broskini
11 May 19:00 - Sam Roberts: Getting the grill on shortly, screening around 9.30?
11 May 19:01 - Pete Morey: Ah kwl,  late showing tonight.  What's a broskini?
11 May 19:02 - Joe Jarman: You handsome
11 May 19:02 - Joe Jarman: üòâ
11 May 19:03 - Pete Morey: :o
11 May 19:17 - Sam Roberts: Someone who isn't here grab some beers please
11 May 19:17 - Sam Roberts: After the ones we're drinking, and the ones we've got on backup, we're all out of beer
12 May 16:25 - Owen: Hi horde. Do any of your workplaces accept year 10 work experience students? Just a week, because the kids that need two weeks you probably wouldn't want. The ones that only need one week are all really nice kids though.
12 May 16:26 - Angela: Mine might
12 May 16:26 - Angela: We have post 6th form interns
12 May 16:26 - Angela: What do they want to do?
12 May 16:27 - Owen: The email didn't say, but if they have left it this late i think they'll be happy with anything.
12 May 16:28 - Owen: I think the idea is that it's shadowing some professional person.
12 May 16:30 - Angela: I think if they came here they'd probably be set some work to do rather than shadowing someone
12 May 16:30 - Eliza: I will take one small child to make me coffee and paint the kitchen please.
12 May 16:31 - Angela: But they would *see* professional people
12 May 17:41 - Shaggy: We don't do babysitting
12 May 17:43 - Hannah Murphy: I can babysit 10 kids if you pay me
12 May 17:43 - Hannah Murphy: ¬£20 an hour per kid
12 May 17:48 - Bongo: Can we get them to work on a new app?
12 May 17:49 - Bongo: What better work experience than to get them to all start their own company
12 May 18:06 - Owen: That's a pretty good idea, but I'm pretty sure the idea is that unless you go to private school you have to learn to serve others. Work experience is there to show kids not to aspire to capital and instead to resign themselves to the fact that their labour is owned by the bourgeoisie. The persuit of capital is only for posh people.
12 May 18:09 - Bongo: Lol that's dark dude
12 May 18:41 - Jimena: Hey Martyn, can I work on a new app üò¨
12 May 18:42 - Owen: You could design us a stamp set üòÑ
12 May 19:02 - Jimena: Me? Do u mean that in a techie way or normal cuz i actually have a stamp making set
12 May 19:04 - Jimena: <Media omitted>
12 May 19:04 - Jimena: Or u can just borrow some of these
12 May 19:04 - Jimena: <Media omitted>
12 May 19:05 - Vinay: ...
12 May 19:05 - Vinay: I want them
12 May 19:05 - Jimena: üòé
12 May 19:09 - Jimena: I also have TONS of stickers. Including glow in the dark and scratch and sniff ones.
12 May 19:09 - Bongo: Scratch and sniff!!
12 May 19:10 - Bongo: Man that brings me back, surely that's not still a thing,
12 May 19:11 - Vinay: Do you also have temporary tattoo stickers?
12 May 19:12 - Vinay: Never heard of/seen scratch and sniff...
12 May 19:13 - Jimena: What?! No scratch and sniff! Teachers used to put them on certificates and stuff when i was a wee lass
12 May 19:14 - Jimena: <Media omitted>
12 May 19:14 - Jimena: They smell like chocolate and other stuff
12 May 19:16 - Vinay: Cool..  So how do I get that racoon, tiger, and wing-eared koala stamp...
12 May 19:17 - Bongo: I had a peanut butter scratch and sniff that gradually started to smell like Tarmac
12 May 19:19 - Vinay: Lol
12 May 19:19 - Vinay: Tarmac doesn't smell that bad though
12 May 19:19 - Bongo: But it doesn't smell like peanut butter
12 May 19:20 - Vinay: Good point üòÖ
12 May 19:20 - Bongo: And so my childhood dreams of a constant supply of peanut butter smell were destroyed
12 May 19:26 - Owen: Jimena, has bongo not told you about our app.
12 May 19:27 - Bongo: I have
12 May 19:27 - Owen: It's that game where you fold paper into three then one person draws the head, one the body, one the legs then you open it out.
12 May 19:28 - Owen: We have added stanps sets so that people don't have to draw thier own eyes and stuff.
12 May 19:30 - Owen: That's what i was suggesting, you could choose a topic and then have your stamp set in the app, if you like that idea. If you want to get into the more technical side of it I could show you the Android end of it, im sure bongo would be willing to show you the Facebook end and if you ask nice Dan could show you the iOS side.
12 May 19:31 - Vinay: Bloody hell, another earthquake in Nepal apparently
12 May 19:35 - Jimena: Aah i see. Yeah that would be fun. Just tell me the image types, size etc
12 May 19:48 - Jimena: Vinay, if you come and pick them up u can have them.
12 May 20:05 - Vinay: üò± when / where?
12 May 20:07 - Vinay: And are you sure? I don't want to take them away if you're fond of them..
12 May 20:53 - Tegan: You have to go to Geneva
12 May 20:54 - Tegan: on a special racoon mission
12 May 20:54 - Tegan: loved the app, guys- Eliza gave us a sneaky preview
12 May 23:00 - Jimena: üòÅ
12 May 23:16 - Alex Bunn: <Media omitted>
13 May 07:40 - Vinay: Oh, Geneva... I will follow you up on that..
13 May 13:05 - Dave: <Media omitted>
13 May 13:24 - Adam Wills: It's the name tag that's impressing me! Ain't nobody gonna deny that is your desk - nice bold font ;)
13 May 13:28 - Vinay: Looks like It can be a Russian dolls thing too
13 May 13:29 - Sam Roberts: Actually he's at Dan Rodrigues Da Costa's desk
13 May 13:39 - Adam Wills: Dave, how many times has Dan told you!? Stop cluttering up his desk with your Russian doll lunch!
13 May 13:40 - Dave: Never! And I'll change all the adjustments on his chair too.
13 May 13:40 - Sam Roberts: üò±
13 May 13:41 - Dave: Uhuh
13 May 13:41 - Adam Wills: takingittoofar
13 May 13:41 - Dave: Eep
13 May 13:42 - Dave: I quite like Dan tbh. Sometimes i sit on his lap and we work together
13 May 13:42 - Adam Wills: And in one fell swoop he just tookittoofartheotherway
13 May 13:43 - Dave: Thank god there is no Dan. It's too complicated with him in my life
13 May 13:45 - Sam Roberts: But the memories you might have had together!
13 May 13:45 - Sam Roberts: The stapling!
13 May 14:38 - Dave: The borrowing of pens!
13 May 17:43 - Owen: Adam, which day are you doing your leaving thing?
13 May 18:22 - Adam Wills: 24th
13 May 19:48 - Owen: Cool. What's the plan.
13 May 19:52 - Dave: It'll be the 25th after Adz spends all of the 24th brushing his teeth and getting ready
13 May 21:59 - Adam Wills: You make a good and fair point Dave, very fair indeed... I will plan for the 23rd then, and arrive on the 24th with very clean teeth (best not to leave it till the 25th as I'll be on a plane)
13 May 22:00 - Dave: Then it's a date
13 May 22:00 - Owen: Even that reply took 2hours and 7 minutes.
13 May 22:00 - Adam Wills: But I do have very clean teeth right now...
13 May 22:01 - Owen: Lol
13 May 22:01 - Adam Wills: I was just thinking of going to the pembury tavern near Hackney central station, for pints and pizza for the afternoon - simple and easy = best
14 May 13:25 - Alex Bunn: Whats the name of the pub in LB next to the river?
14 May 13:35 - Tegan: the mudlark?
14 May 13:35 - Tegan: does it look like this?
14 May 13:35 - Tegan: <Media omitted>
14 May 13:35 - Tegan: ha
14 May 13:35 - Tegan: thursday
14 May 13:49 - Alex Bunn: üò¶üëé
14 May 14:41 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: Not cool

14 May 20:13 - Vinay: Thanks V, will check them out. I've made some ambigrams and it would be great to convert them to stamps
14 May 20:23 - Sam Roberts: What's an ambigram?
14 May 20:24 - Vinay: Um, typically ambigrams are words that read the same thing upside down
14 May 20:24 - Vinay: But it can read something completely different too
14 May 20:27 - Vinay: <Media omitted>
14 May 20:29 - Vinay: <Media omitted>

14 May 20:31 - Vinay: Tegan probably put your phone on table and rotate horizantally on x axis.. Or turn off screen rotation üòÖ

19 May 08:22 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: Did we decide a cinema last night?
19 May 08:32 - Owen: Does anyone know any good pubs near kings cross?
19 May 08:34 - Alex Bunn: Good pubs near kings cross: big chill house
19 May 08:35 - Alex Bunn: The fellow
19 May 08:36 - Alex Bunn: I had my first cycle to work from the new house
19 May 08:36 - Alex Bunn: very underwhelming
19 May 08:37 - Alex Bunn: So short and so safe!
19 May 08:37 - Alex Bunn: Barely broke a sweat and didnt have any life threatening junctions to cross
19 May 08:37 - Alex Bunn: 2/10
19 May 08:40 - Owen: I was confused then, i thought "the new house" was a pub and you were rating said pub based of how hard a cycle to work is from it, which felt like a fairly arbitrary measure.
19 May 08:40 - Owen: Thanks for the suggestions.
19 May 08:58 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: @Bunn - take a detour and cycle round Bank/Monument for a bit
19 May 08:58 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: I think that's my nastiest/fav place to cycle
19 May 08:59 - Alex Bunn: Haha. Maybe i will!
19 May 09:00 - Dave: Owen, Central Station has free pool, cheap beer and a downstairs dungeon
19 May 09:02 - Dave: Simmons bar is nice but small - has good drinks offers til 8 or 9
19 May 09:03 - Owen: Dungeon? Like... Sex.. Dungeon...? My my Dave, I wouldn't have guessed!
19 May 09:03 - Dave: Backpackers is cheap, has a roof garden. Often friendly people there
19 May 09:04 - Dave: Ha, Sam knows more about what happens down there than me
19 May 09:05 - Shaggy: Premier in is cheap but not very atmospheric
19 May 09:07 - Owen: Is that a joke shaggy?
19 May 09:07 - Owen: I'm not taking a date to a premier inn!
19 May 09:07 - Owen: Well not immediately anyway üòâ
19 May 09:07 - Shaggy: That depends what the goal is
19 May 09:22 - Hannah Murphy: Bunn - please do not take cycling advice from Mike
19 May 09:22 - Hannah Murphy: Or do you wanna get all scarred up?
19 May 09:22 - Alex Bunn: Haha. But he rides to the Xtreme
19 May 09:22 - Hannah Murphy: Like a MAN

19 May 09:44 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: <Media omitted>
19 May 09:45 - Alex Bunn: Dorne seriously needs to step up a notch
19 May 09:45 - Alex Bunn: I was super excited at the end of season 4
19 May 09:45 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: Seriously, it's like Hercules blood in the sand
19 May 09:57 - Alex Bunn: I dont know what that is but i assume its shit
19 May 09:57 - Alex Bunn: People are slating that scene on the interwebs
19 May 10:00 - Joe Jarman: It was a bit comic really
19 May 10:00 - Alex Bunn: Cant wait to watch it again tho
19 May 10:07 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: I meant Spartacus woops
19 May 10:07 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: Yeah, is pants
19 May 10:08 - Sam Roberts: You seen it past the first two episodes?
19 May 10:08 - Sam Roberts: It's amazing!
19 May 10:08 - Owen: Spoilers!
19 May 10:09 - Sam Roberts: There's a scene where a guys face gets cut off and his brain falls out
19 May 10:09 - Shaggy: Brain is attached to your spine
19 May 10:10 - Sam Roberts: Not this guy's
19 May 10:10 - Sam Roberts: Hey yeah we didn't decide a cinema
19 May 10:11 - Sam Roberts: Think richmix was the leader though
19 May 10:47 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: I'm easy
19 May 10:47 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: Rich mix showing at 9, still lots of seats free
19 May 11:39 - Sam Roberts: I'm in
19 May 11:39 - Sam Roberts: Climbing first if anyone fancies
19 May 11:51 - Alex Bunn: I would but i think it might chuck it down later
19 May 11:51 - Alex Bunn: ‚òîÔ∏è
19 May 12:05 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: What are people thinking then?
19 May 12:05 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: Not gona hang around til 9 on my own!
19 May 12:22 - Alex Bunn: Tbh i'm out
19 May 12:22 - Tegan: Lize and I were saying we'd be up for it next week
19 May 12:23 - Tegan: This week is looking too busay
19 May 12:25 - Vanessa: Owen there's also Drink, Shop & Do at kings cross. It's not a pub but a nice place
19 May 12:30 - Dave: Just watched a UKIP MEP mess up his speech at the European Parliament.

He ended by saying "yes to the EU, no to the UK" then had to correct himself
19 May 12:31 - Dave: @owen and v - Hausmann's bookshop is also a great kings x shop.
19 May 12:35 - Owen: I think I agree with him.
19 May 12:35 - Owen: Let's start a no to the UK party, lets just become Europe already.
19 May 12:49 - Tegan: lol
19 May 12:49 - Tegan: I bet he was practising all the way there
19 May 12:49 - Tegan: 'no EU, yes UK
19 May 12:50 - Tegan: 'yes EU, no UK'
19 May 12:50 - Tegan: Dammit!
19 May 12:50 - Owen: Lol
19 May 12:53 - Owen: Did you know that the negative externalities and subsidies for fossil fuels equal 6.5% of the worlds GDP. The IMF just published a study, they also say they have probably underestimated because they only looked at directly attributable financially measurable externalities.
19 May 12:56 - Dave: What's the split between subsidies and externalities?
19 May 13:05 - Shaggy: I don't even know what externalities are
19 May 13:07 - Owen: <Media omitted>
19 May 13:07 - Owen: Here's the breakdown Dave.
19 May 13:07 - Owen: It's mainly externalities.
19 May 13:08 - Owen: The article did this annoying thing of calling them both subsidies, I guess because not everyone knows what a negative externality is.
19 May 13:09 - Owen: http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/may/18/fossil-fuel-companies-getting-10m-a-minute-in-subsidies-says-imf?CMP=fb_gu
19 May 13:09 - Owen: That's the article.
19 May 13:09 - Dave: @shaggy - Externalities are costs or benefits which are not accounted for in the market price of a good.
19 May 13:11 - Dave: So the polluting effect of a car would not usually factor into it's price but is a cost to the environment
19 May 13:11 - Dave: This cost can be internalised by adding a tax to the car in terms of how green it is
19 May 13:12 - Dave: Or alterntively it can be culturally internalised by making owning green cars desirable
19 May 13:45 - Owen: What's even crazier is that 6.5% figure comes without including global warming at all!
19 May 18:05 - Lorna: So who's coming to the cinema then? I'm heading to Shoreditch now
19 May 18:06 - Lorna: Or shall we go next week if people prefer?
19 May 18:13 - Sam Roberts: Uhhhhh
19 May 18:14 - Sam Roberts: Mike made me go to canary wharf
19 May 18:14 - Sam Roberts: Come to canary wharf? Just setting off now
19 May 18:15 - Lorna: Pssh. What time's the film there?
19 May 18:38 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: 8, sry thought no one was interested
19 May 18:43 - Sam Roberts: Just got to c&c, anyone want a pint?
19 May 18:58 - Lorna: Its too far to canary wharf, I'm out.
19 May 18:58 - Tegan: Bloody Mike
19 May 19:00 - Sam Roberts: Super quick from Shoreditch, overground to Canada water then 1 stop

25 May 19:39 - Martha: Me too!
25 May 19:39 - Vinay: Me three
25 May 19:44 - Tegan: Awesome news big L - let me know tomorrow
25 May 19:44 - Tegan: cuuuuute
25 May 19:52 - Sam Roberts: All good got lighting fluid v
25 May 19:52 - Sam Roberts: Cheers for looking
25 May 20:51 - Eliza: Sorry, not going to make it. Have a good one!
25 May 21:38 - Joe Jarman: Give her one from us üòâ wheeeey
25 May 23:19 - Owen: Joe, we'd appreciate it if you saved your crass jokes where they belong, which is the opinion page of the sun newspaper.
25 May 23:23 - Joe Jarman: Sorry mate, alll bbqd up. Dear Deidre isn't what it used to be!
26 May 16:18 - Eliza: Owen says one of you (he can't remember who...) was saying something about some course in Greek myth...? What was this?
26 May 16:54 - Shaggy: Age of wonders II, I think it's on sale
26 May 16:57 - Owen: I'm not sure that was it... I swear someone was talking about some online course. I may have misunderstood though.
26 May 16:57 - Tegan: I think it was Sam
26 May 16:58 - Owen: I think it was too.
26 May 16:59 - Owen: @Sam, what was that greek myth thing you were talking about on sunday?
26 May 17:47 - Sam Roberts: Wasn't me on Sunday (out maybe it was, that was a large bottle of rum for one person)
26 May 17:48 - Sam Roberts: I sent it a message a little while back for an mitx online course on Greek myth and culture, I'll try and dig out the link but you can probably find it faster on the mitx or edx website
26 May 17:48 - Sam Roberts: I'm up for it if you fancy a study buddy
26 May 18:05 - Eliza: Ohh very maybe! I'll have a look, I just signed up for an online course on Film Noir as well - so I'll see how it works time wise...
26 May 18:41 - Eliza: The Ancient Greek hero? Or Greeks at war? Or Western Civilisation - ancient and medieval Europe? Is it one of those?
26 May 18:41 - Sam Roberts: Greek hero was the one I was looking at
26 May 18:41 - Sam Roberts: Open to whichever seems most badass though
26 May 18:42 - Eliza: Starting in September? Yes, I would be interested!
26 May 18:42 - Bongo: In myth or irl?
26 May 18:43 - Eliza: In epics and poems. Myth (mostly) I think.
26 May 18:45 - Bongo: What's that one with Eurydice?
26 May 18:45 - Bongo: That dude was a legend
26 May 18:45 - Bongo: And deserves a heavy metal theme tune for going to hell and back
26 May 18:47 - Eliza: The guy with the lyre? Yeah, he's cool. I think the course is mostly about The Iliad (Paris, Achilles, etc...) and Sapho's poems which I am not familiar with.
26 May 18:47 - Bongo: Orpheus
26 May 18:47 - Bongo: Is the guy
26 May 18:48 - Eliza: If anyone is interested in a course of film noir starting in June as well... http://www.openculture.com/2015/05/take-a-free-course-on-film-noir.html
26 May 18:49 - Eliza: Oh yeah, Orpheus was the guy, Eurydice was his lady love.
26 May 18:52 - Dan Sluckin: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_zLcaS76OtM
27 May 15:38 - Joe Jarman: Cinema 2 for 1 code if anyone wants it!
27 May 18:18 - Hannah Murphy: <Media omitted>
27 May 18:22 - Owen: Don't you legally have to offer tap water for free?
27 May 18:23 - Tegan: Cold, though
27 May 18:25 - Owen: Nice. I love cold things. Like winter and hearts.
27 May 18:29 - Hannah Murphy: Apparently it's just a tap with some cups
27 May 18:30 - Bongo: Lol that's so hipster
27 May 18:31 - Bongo: They probably have happy hour competitions to see who can drink their water the most ironically
27 May 18:32 - Bongo: And instead of a tv they just watch the local stray cat licking its balls
27 May 18:34 - Owen: Are you sure it's just tap water? It's not different types of mineral water or something?
27 May 18:53 - Vanessa: That would make more sense. water sommeliers actually exist
27 May 18:53 - Hannah Murphy: No I think it's some kind of thing for charity
27 May 18:53 - Hannah Murphy: To raise awareness of some water charity
27 May 18:57 - Hannah Murphy: On another note -government banning selling/manufacturing of all legal highs
27 May 18:58 - Hannah Murphy: Including laughing gas etcetc
27 May 18:58 - Hannah Murphy: That's a whole generation of 13 year olds won't get to try poppers
27 May 18:59 - Owen: What the hell do they count as a legal high?
27 May 18:59 - Shaggy: Laughing gas has a legitimate use though, what are they going to do about that?
27 May 18:59 - Owen: How will restaurants whip cream?
27 May 18:59 - Shaggy: Surely it doesn't include that
27 May 18:59 - Owen: And how will botanists feed thier plants?
27 May 19:00 - Shaggy: How will they feed their marijuana plants?
27 May 19:00 - Owen: Meow meow was sold as plant food.
27 May 19:02 - Shaggy: It was although it wasn't actually used for that purpose so we safely class it as a legal high
27 May 19:03 - Owen: Agreed, but how will the government know that the next plant food that gets released isn't a legal high?
27 May 19:06 - Shaggy: Well you could look at the chemical composition, so if it looks like MDMA, behaves like MDMA but is plant food then I'd argue it's probably not really plant food
27 May 19:08 - Shaggy: I would also argue that if we know that it's not plant food then so does the government
27 May 19:09 - Owen: Oh they would know, I'm just not sure how they legally prove it is.
27 May 19:47 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: Meh. Legal drugs. Meh.
27 May 19:47 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: The secret ingredient is crime anyway
27 May 19:48 - Dave: How about glue?
27 May 19:50 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: What about auto-asphyxiation?
27 May 19:50 - Shaggy: Only if it's erotic
27 May 19:52 - Owen: What about looking at the sun too long? Are the government gonna ban that too?
27 May 20:19 - Dave: Only for the poor
27 May 21:37 - Jimena: Btw: u guys heard about GoT: the musical? https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=RfI_mUIvYq8#
27 May 23:32 - Shaggy: Yes, it's great!
28 May 01:05 - Bongo: Heard it, amazing.
28 May 01:44 - Owen: Watching Dwyane "the rock" Johnson act is like watching Dwyane "a rock" Johnson act.
28 May 01:44 - Owen: Don't tell Phil I said that!
28 May 16:51 - Vanessa: Phah! Sepp Blatter says he's not responsible for the corruption. What a hoot
28 May 17:34 - Alex Bunn: Haha. He has to go!
28 May 17:36 - Alex Bunn: I think this corruption exposure is well timed considering he's put himself up for re-election despite promising he was gonna step down
28 May 17:36 - Alex Bunn: Its just a shame that Luis Figo dropped out of the presidential race
28 May 17:37 - Alex Bunn: Blatter wont fall on his sword tho
28 May 17:42 - Vanessa: I'm really hoping something good comes out of this. The U.S. is really taking this seriously and the change in legislation in Switzerland has enabled the Swiss authorities to actually act
29 May 14:34 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: http://www.zeit.de/sport/2015-05/sepp-blatter-all-reasons

29 May 14:57 - Shaggy: Sepp
29 May 15:01 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: I think it might be better for FIFA to collapse completely
29 May 15:02 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: Sepp winning would be conducive to that
29 May 16:34 - Dave: Anyone for a pint? I may leave work early
29 May 17:04 - Alex Bunn: Fitzrovia?
29 May 17:06 - Shaggy: I'm down for a pint
29 May 17:08 - Tegan: I'm on for about 6.30
29 May 17:28 - Dave: Frizrovia could work. Ibwas thinking kings x
29 May 17:31 - Dave: I'm gonna head to King's x. Hope that suits peeps
29 May 17:37 - Shaggy: Going to have a couple near work, will see how it goes after
29 May 18:19 - Owen: <Media omitted>
29 May 18:28 - Tegan: I think gyms are safe
29 May 18:29 - Tegan: similar effect could be attained with a marker pen, and it would be much more portable
29 May 18:44 - Vinay: Haha that's brilliant
29 May 19:17 - Alex Bunn: üòÇ

1 Jun 11:46 - Alex Bunn: We're ahead of the books on that arc üòú

2 Jun 11:41 - Jimena: Dont know the thick of it. W
2 Jun 11:41 - Jimena: Whats it about?
2 Jun 11:45 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: The thick of it is the original comedy set in Westminster that Veep is based on

2 Jun 20:25 - Hannah Murphy: Sepp you Blatter, alligatter!

3 Jun 22:39 - Dave: Nope
3 Jun 22:39 - Dave: Not a concept with which a perceive the world
3 Jun 22:50 - Shaggy: I know it very well
4 Jun 10:11 - Owen: Phew, I almost just made a ¬£100 mistake on a circuit board design. Lesson: check everything 10 times before spending money.

4 Jun 20:55 - Bongo: I always though that place was missing a helicopter
4 Jun 22:29 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: That would be such a great google map get
5 Jun 07:25 - Jimena: <Media omitted>
5 Jun 07:26 - Jimena: No special rights for immigrants. Political campaign against voting rights for immigrants in bern, switzerland
5 Jun 07:27 - Jimena: The party 'udc' is famous here for all kinds of outrageous posters
5 Jun 07:28 - Vinay: Wow..
5 Jun 07:29 - Vinay: Where is the third guy from?
5 Jun 07:29 - Jimena: <Media omitted>
5 Jun 07:30 - Vinay: That's a bit too... Nationalist?
5 Jun 07:30 - Shaggy: Third guy looks Georgian
5 Jun 07:31 - Vinay: Oh, I was guessing Russia or Poland
5 Jun 07:33 - Jimena: <Media omitted>
5 Jun 07:34 - Jimena: Considering immigrant populations here i would say he is either eastern european or arab
5 Jun 07:35 - Jimena: Its a super racist nationalist party
5 Jun 07:37 - Jimena: The funny thing with the last poster is that the supposed ivan is actually a swiss guy, not a known rapist and they took his photo from the internet without asking
5 Jun 07:38 - Alex Bunn: Third guy is a jew
5 Jun 07:38 - Shaggy: You mean Israeli, yes that's possible
5 Jun 07:48 - Lorna: Did anyone else just hear the DJ Yoda mash up of radio 4 sounds?
5 Jun 07:53 - Angela: Yeah!
5 Jun 07:54 - Angela: How random was that!
5 Jun 07:54 - Angela: "And now here's thought for the day"
5 Jun 07:55 - Lorna: Yeah that was pretty funny!
5 Jun 08:03 - Owen: The third guy is clearly Borat!
5 Jun 10:42 - Jimena: So what would be your ethnic stereotype?
5 Jun 10:43 - Jimena: <Media omitted>
5 Jun 10:47 - Shaggy: <Media omitted>
5 Jun 10:50 - Jimena: Where is he from?
5 Jun 10:50 - Jimena: Awesome hair and moustache
5 Jun 11:06 - Owen: <Media omitted>
5 Jun 11:08 - Hannah Murphy: OMg shaggy so that's what you were trying to do with that moustache last Christmas
5 Jun 11:09 - Shaggy: Trying? I nailed it
5 Jun 11:09 - Hannah Murphy: Well done you for trying
5 Jun 11:12 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: Haha, burn
5 Jun 11:13 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: He looks like a character from Asterix
5 Jun 11:13 - Shaggy: That's your authentic Ukrainian Cossack, not some stupid gall
5 Jun 11:13 - Shaggy: Gaul
5 Jun 11:16 - Dave: <Media omitted>
5 Jun 11:27 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: What stereotype is that?
5 Jun 11:27 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: Tegan, you'd better not be on the egg council
5 Jun 11:27 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: <Media omitted>
5 Jun 11:27 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: <Media omitted>
5 Jun 11:53 - Dave: Sorry, misunderstood the brief. I guess when i saw shaggys picture i took the idea to be how you would best represent your soul. Ergo egg.
5 Jun 11:57 - Tegan: xx
5 Jun 11:59 - Shaggy: I think restaurants should reward wastelessness (let's assume it's a word) by giving discounts to customers who finish their food. Or vice versa, penalise those who waste it
5 Jun 12:00 - Tegan: I think restaursnts should offer smaller portions and then the possibility of seconds
5 Jun 12:01 - Angela: We could ponder over the seconds menu
5 Jun 12:01 - Angela: And then decide we'd better not
5 Jun 12:01 - Shaggy: Also good
5 Jun 12:01 - Tegan: Would be great!
5 Jun 12:02 - Tegan: or charge the same price for a smaller meal with optional seconds
5 Jun 12:02 - Tegan: You know, for boys
5 Jun 12:03 - Dave: That's something i could get behind. Double dinner!
5 Jun 12:03 - Dave: üåΩ then üçÜ
5 Jun 12:03 - Vanessa: That's what doggy bags are for, to not waste your food
5 Jun 12:03 - Tegan: üåµ
5 Jun 12:03 - Tegan: You just reminded me I have pizza in the fridge!
5 Jun 12:04 - Tegan: Oh happy day!
5 Jun 12:04 - Angela: Ooh seconds in a doggy bag would be great!
5 Jun 12:04 - Vanessa: Maybe it's not practiced much  here
5 Jun 12:04 - Angela: Would avoid that problem of already having eaten all the best bits
5 Jun 12:04 - Tegan: Some places not others
5 Jun 12:04 - Tegan: true
5 Jun 12:04 - Dave: üçïwin
5 Jun 12:04 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: Why's it called a doggy bag?
5 Jun 12:05 - Angela: Maybe some people give it to the dog?
5 Jun 12:08 - Shaggy: They are not compulsory. I'm not worried about me wasting food, it's others
5 Jun 12:09 - Owen: Restaurants should just have a pit of lizards out back and then throw scraps to said lizards.
5 Jun 12:09 - Owen: You could also throw unruly customers into said pit.
5 Jun 12:09 - Angela: Maybe there could be doggy bagging rights at restaurants - if you see a plate of unfinished food from another table you should be able to claim it
5 Jun 12:09 - Shaggy: That's again, wasteful
5 Jun 12:10 - Owen: Not if you one day ride the lizards into battle
5 Jun 12:10 - Shaggy: What about cooties? That's unsanitary
5 Jun 12:10 - Dave: Yes Angie. I always want to finish food on other tables but tegan says it's not the done thing
5 Jun 12:10 - Angela: Let's start a campaign!
5 Jun 12:10 - Shaggy: Doggy and bagging. Are we still talking about food?
5 Jun 12:11 - Angela: Campaign for doggy bagging
5 Jun 12:11 - Dave: I remember spending a long 10 mins staring at someone's uneaten chunky chips in a pub debating whether i could take them
5 Jun 12:11 - Dave: Sadly i did not
5 Jun 12:11 - Dave: A decision is regret to this day
5 Jun 12:12 - Angela: You should carry around some Tupperware. Once it's in your Tupperware all cooties disappear and that's science
5 Jun 12:12 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: Surely you can only get a doggy bag if you already bought food
5 Jun 12:12 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: Otherwise that's bad business
5 Jun 12:13 - Shaggy: Nah I think that's fair too
5 Jun 12:13 - Shaggy: I like what pret do, I just wish they didn't brag about it so much
5 Jun 12:13 - Angela: Just because I've bought food, doesn't stop me wanting to eat everyone else's food
5 Jun 12:13 - Dave: You could pay for the right to take others food. It's like a buffet of other people's food.
5 Jun 12:13 - Shaggy: But mega cheap
5 Jun 12:13 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: Yeah but if you haven't bought food you can't take someone elses
5 Jun 12:14 - Shaggy: Cos otherwise it goes to ducking lizards
5 Jun 12:14 - Tegan: in other countries, they take food you haven't eaten (breads etc) and put it straight on other people's tables
5 Jun 12:15 - Tegan: of course, instances of vommunicable disease are much higher in those countries. ..
5 Jun 12:15 - Tegan: lol
5 Jun 12:15 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: Lol
5 Jun 12:15 - Tegan: communicable
5 Jun 12:15 - Shaggy: I think we should collectively start a restaurant of international food, where all waiters are stereotypes and then we can test these ideas. We can even get a lizard pit
5 Jun 12:15 - Angela: Lol diseases
5 Jun 12:17 - Owen: Yay! Lizard pit! I'm in. We just need to choose who to ride them into battle against.
5 Jun 12:18 - Shaggy: I think first candidate is Tegan, mostly due to size
5 Jun 12:18 - Shaggy: Or maybe Peter dinklage
5 Jun 12:19 - Owen: No no no, I meant who do we attack, not who rides the lizards. Obviously Tegan and Eliza and V ride the lizards
5 Jun 12:20 - Shaggy: Oh sorry, misread
5 Jun 12:20 - Tegan: lol
5 Jun 12:20 - Tegan: me and Peter dinklage
5 Jun 12:21 - Shaggy: Well, are they nuclear lizards? Maybe Putin?
5 Jun 12:21 - Owen: They are not nuclear lizards, unless litvinyenko visits our restaurant and his scraps get fed to the lizards.
5 Jun 12:22 - Shaggy: I don't want that kind of clientele, that's my one veto
5 Jun 12:23 - Owen: But assassinations are good for business.
5 Jun 12:23 - Owen: As are lizards.
5 Jun 12:24 - Shaggy: Assassinations leave at least one less person to pay
5 Jun 12:24 - Owen: Oh they pay alright!
5 Jun 12:24 - Angela: I'm not sure lizards would attack Putin. He is one of them
5 Jun 12:24 - Owen: Pay with their lives!
5 Jun 12:24 - Shaggy: You grow the lizards but that's not the primary business model
5 Jun 12:24 - Owen: Whaaa??
5 Jun 12:25 - Shaggy: Lizards aren't that discriminatory
5 Jun 12:25 - Shaggy: Step 3 is profit, not global domination
5 Jun 12:25 - Owen: Are we not running a shady lizard farm, did I miss something?
5 Jun 12:25 - Owen: Wow wow wow, wait.
5 Jun 12:25 - Angela: http://www.google.co.uk/imgres?imgurl=https://threehundredsixtyfivethousand.files.wordpress.com/2014/01/7.jpg&imgrefurl=https://threehundredsixtyfivethousand.wordpress.com/2014/01/07/7-lizard-people-putin-fevers-and-what-not/&h=545&w=673&tbnid=p5er_2faUeI7UM:&zoom=1&docid=zXBXkdfmpW_paM&hl=en-GB&ei=JodxVfPHFK_Y7AaC64CgAg&tbm=isch&ved=0CB4QMygAMAA
5 Jun 12:25 - Owen: You are not dreaming big enough dear boy.
5 Jun 12:26 - Shaggy: I have humble aspirations
5 Jun 12:26 - Shaggy: I want a restaurant where people don't waste food
5 Jun 12:27 - Shaggy: That's a good picture but you get a down vote for using a link
5 Jun 12:28 - Angela: www.kissmyass.com
5 Jun 12:28 - Owen: I wish wassap did have up and downvotes. I would have so many downvotes for derailing conversations by ranting about lizards!
5 Jun 12:30 - Shaggy: If a bear and a lizard had a child, it would be Owens wet dream
5 Jun 12:30 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: A blizzard
5 Jun 12:31 - Shaggy: Man I can't believe I missed that
5 Jun 12:31 - Owen: Oh my
5 Jun 12:32 - Shaggy: <Media omitted>
5 Jun 15:05 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: <Media omitted>
5 Jun 15:07 - Owen: That's out of the box thinking.
5 Jun 15:08 - Owen: Airlines hate him. You won't believe this one trick a student used to save money on his flights.
5 Jun 15:30 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: Did you see that story about the dude offering a free round the world trip to any woman with the same name as his ex?
5 Jun 16:35 - Dave: Yeah. They had a good time apparently.
5 Jun 16:35 - Dave: But no schnarf

8 Jun 16:49 - Sam Roberts: Any preferred size? What about those ginger wine bottles?
8 Jun 16:52 - Lorna: No they need caps. 500ml is good. Reckon I only need about 4 litres, so should be easy.

12 Jun 05:57 - Adam Wills: It's great to see you're getting into football Dave!
12 Jun 05:58 - Adam Wills: From what text is included in the picture it looks like Rio Ferdinand is getting 'semi-bookended'... With 'text-book skill'
12 Jun 05:58 - Adam Wills: Urban dictionary defines bookended as 'When, while sitting at a bar, a person is flanked on either side by individuals who have chosen to take out books and read rather than continue a conversation. Also known as a Bilateral Booking.'
12 Jun 05:59 - Adam Wills: ... I guess the mystery continues
12 Jun 06:00 - Adam Wills: Unless Rio has hiding sought after paperbacks up his hidey
12 Jun 07:00 - Tegan: lol

12 Jun 22:27 - Vanessa: It feels like a Caribbean beach bar without the sand
12 Jun 23:04 - Dave: Just read all this - I'd ve amazed if anyone meets anyone tonight at this rate
13 Jun 00:15 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: It was a shambles
13 Jun 10:36 - Shaggy: Spinoza sounds a great guy
13 Jun 14:09 - Sam Roberts: Why?
13 Jun 14:09 - Sam Roberts: The philosopher?
13 Jun 14:09 - Sam Roberts: Which one was Spinoza?
13 Jun 14:10 - Dave: Some rationalist
13 Jun 14:11 - Sam Roberts: He destroyed medieval ethics apparently
13 Jun 14:11 - Sam Roberts: And had a pretty sweet hat
13 Jun 14:11 - Sam Roberts: Hey who got to Dalston yesterday¬ø
13 Jun 14:16 - Shaggy: He tried to rationalise religion, did pretty well in my opinion, although his rabbis wouldn't agree
13 Jun 14:16 - Sam Roberts: Then I disagree with his whole project
13 Jun 14:16 - Sam Roberts: That's like rationalizing art
13 Jun 14:16 - Sam Roberts: You can reach a conclusion, but you've lost the essence of the subject by the time you get there
13 Jun 14:21 - Shaggy: Art fart
13 Jun 14:51 - Dave: Just been reading hus wiki page with Tegs. Seems a nice phikosophy. He's similar to Berkeley in his view of God. He sees thought and substance as being interacting and is against descartes in thinking them different. He doesn't belive in free will and is similar to the Stoics.
13 Jun 15:41 - Dave: üí©

13 Jun 16:38 - Owen: He doesn't have to. He just stops thinking about her?
13 Jun 16:39 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: 'It's not you it's me'
13 Jun 16:40 - Owen: Hahah
13 Jun 22:02 - Dave: <Media omitted>
13 Jun 22:12 - Alex Bunn: Lol

13 Jun 22:36 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: I still think it was my idea
13 Jun 23:50 - Alex Bunn: How on earth did you manage that?!?
13 Jun 23:50 - Alex Bunn: Jokes
14 Jun 01:35 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: We had a dream
14 Jun 07:46 - Adam Wills: This is amazing
14 Jun 07:46 - Adam Wills: FP shaggy and mike
14 Jun 17:36 - Alex Bunn: Do films get cheaper if they've been in the cinema for a long time?
14 Jun 17:37 - Alex Bunn: I think that should be a thing
14 Jun 17:42 - Bongo: Nah don't think so, they're only cheaper if they're crap
14 Jun 17:43 - Alex Bunn: I think they might make more money if they got a bit cheaper once their popularity starts to drop
14 Jun 17:45 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: Planet money did an episode about variable ticket pricing
14 Jun 17:46 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: I remember they made convincing arguments about why they don't, and I don't remember any of them
14 Jun 17:46 - Alex Bunn: Whats planet money?
14 Jun 17:46 - Sam Roberts: Haha I was thinking the same
14 Jun 17:47 - Sam Roberts: Maybe that it forces people to wait for the good rate?
14 Jun 17:47 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: http://www.npr.org/sections/money/2014/07/11/330680385/episode-552-blockbusters-bombs-and-the-price-of-a-ticket
14 Jun 17:48 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: Not quite the same as your idea, but same principle
14 Jun 17:56 - Owen: I was thinking exactly the same thing mike. Including the "I can't remember any of the conclusions" bit.
14 Jun 17:57 - Owen: If I remember the show was more about why blockbusters don't cost more than indie films.
14 Jun 17:58 - Owen: And if I remember correctly it's because the studios don't let it happen.
14 Jun 18:20 - Bongo: Charging less for how long it's been out would be admitting that it's value deteriorates over time which is probably only true just after release but it would make it seem that way past the release
14 Jun 18:20 - Bongo: So they probably just want to market it as "all of our movies are timeless"
14 Jun 18:21 - Bongo: Also it might convince people who were already going to see it straight away that they should wait until it gets cheaper
14 Jun 18:23 - Alex Bunn: Btw my housemates say the new jurassic world film is cheesy awesomeness to the max
14 Jun 18:23 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: Yeah I wana see it
14 Jun 18:23 - Sam Roberts: Is it out? Thought it was next month?
14 Jun 18:24 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: Nah it's out
14 Jun 18:24 - Owen: I'm seeing it in IMAX next Saturday!!
14 Jun 18:25 - Dave: I'd be up for a mid week film if anyone else is
14 Jun 18:37 - Dave: <Media omitted>
14 Jun 18:40 - Tegan: well, there are a lot of barbers
14 Jun 18:40 - Tegan: I guess you have to differentiate yourself
14 Jun 18:43 - Lorna: The Jurassic park film is supposed to be basically an inferior copy of the first one.
14 Jun 18:44 - Bongo: That would still make it better than any of the sequels
14 Jun 18:44 - Dave: Beat me to it!
14 Jun 18:44 - Bongo: They're.. They're.. They're learning
14 Jun 18:44 - Angela: I went to see it today, it's extremely silly but quite enjoyable
14 Jun 18:45 - Tegan: had it got any real fictional science in it?
14 Jun 18:45 - Angela: Some mega cheesy scenes, yup some real fictional science, a wobbly DNA character
14 Jun 18:45 - Angela: Keeps
14 Jun 18:45 - Angela: Jeeps
14 Jun 18:46 - Angela: It has it all
14 Jun 18:46 - Tegan: You know, like when the sharks got smarter, or when the scientists discovered green?
14 Jun 18:46 - Tegan: awesome to the max
14 Jun 18:47 - Angela: Nobody gives a shit about archeologists any more though, that's old hat
14 Jun 18:47 - Angela: It's all about snazzy geneticists
14 Jun 18:47 - Bongo: Does it have a scene where they hack into the mainframe to save the day?
14 Jun 18:48 - Tegan: The dna mainframe...
14 Jun 18:48 - Bongo: By a girl who learnt how to hack from Microsoft excel 2000 training
14 Jun 18:48 - Tegan: yeah!
14 Jun 18:48 - Angela: I can't confirm or deny those rumours. It might spoil the incredible suspense and uncertainty about the outcome
14 Jun 18:49 - Lorna: Jurassic park trivia: when Dr Grant gets on the helicopter and has two female ends of his seatbelt, he ties them together. This is a metaphor for how NATURE FINDS A WAY
14 Jun 18:49 - Angela: mind. Blown.
14 Jun 18:49 - Shaggy: Actually the hacking scene is pretty much the only example that is feasible and uses real existing tools
14 Jun 18:50 - Tegan: and a potent reminder that you should never shake with a lizard
14 Jun 18:50 - Tegan: lest you change its sex
14 Jun 18:55 - Tegan: No niche mighty bosh radio fans in the house then
14 Jun 18:55 - Tegan: k
14 Jun 18:55 - Angela: There needs to be a tumbleweed emoji
14 Jun 19:14 - Bongo: Lol that's not nature finding a way, that's man making the most of a situation when he's inbetween two female parts
14 Jun 21:55 - Owen: http://imgur.com/Xsu770n
14 Jun 22:04 - Bongo: Amazing! I always like to think animals are way more intelligent than us and that they're just putting on a show for us every time we try to document them so see how far they get make us believe is silly things
14 Jun 22:04 - Bongo: So many typos, I give up
15 Jun 11:56 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: <Media omitted>
15 Jun 11:56 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: Last C town big meat ever!
15 Jun 11:56 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: Attendance mandatory
15 Jun 11:59 - Shaggy: Mega hype
15 Jun 11:59 - Alex Bunn: I'm no longer team stannis
15 Jun 12:00 - Alex Bunn: He can fucking freeze to death in the most anticlimactic last episode
15 Jun 12:00 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: #teamwhitewalkers
15 Jun 12:00 - Shaggy: Just cause you can't tan
15 Jun 12:02 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: I don't get why anyone was surprised about stannis
15 Jun 12:02 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: This is how he's acted the whole show
15 Jun 12:03 - Alex Bunn: But he did the speech
15 Jun 12:03 - Alex Bunn: About the princess
15 Jun 12:03 - Alex Bunn: With the awkward reluctant hug
15 Jun 12:03 - Sam Roberts: <Media omitted>
15 Jun 12:04 - Alex Bunn: Maybe they needed to play up his desperation a bit more rather than his fatherly qualities
15 Jun 12:04 - Alex Bunn: Good image sam!
15 Jun 12:13 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: Stannis shouldn't have shot his load on his brother, so to speak
15 Jun 12:14 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: Should have saved that shadow thing for the end boss, probly danaerys at this rate
15 Jun 12:24 - Alex Bunn: He just wanted to bang the red priestess
15 Jun 12:25 - Alex Bunn: Shadow baby assassin = fortunate result
15 Jun 12:26 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: Such a lad
15 Jun 13:33 - Tegan: totally unhyped to miss last big meat Monday :(
15 Jun 13:33 - Tegan: request minimal spoilers
15 Jun 13:37 - Sam Roberts: Oh nooooo! How come?
15 Jun 13:38 - Tegan: <Media omitted>
15 Jun 13:39 - Tegan: sunshine lacking
15 Jun 13:39 - Sam Roberts: That's not how I pictured Tring
15 Jun 13:40 - Tegan: Nah, Bletchley
15 Jun 13:40 - Tegan: Then sri lanka
15 Jun 13:41 - Sam Roberts: Hmm you might want to leave the horde for a couple of days
15 Jun 13:41 - Sam Roberts: I promise I won't spoiler, but drunk Sam promises nothing
15 Jun 13:43 - Joe Jarman: JOoooooohhhhhnnmm snnnOOoOOOh
15 Jun 13:44 - Joe Jarman: watch teegz downloooad it
15 Jun 14:08 - Owen: Is that a canal bridge over a river? How quaint!
15 Jun 14:23 - Tegan: We'll see what the remote hotel wifi can do
15 Jun 14:23 - Tegan: I'll try to join you in spirit
15 Jun 14:39 - Tegan: Pretty quaint
15 Jun 14:39 - Tegan: Some sizeable bats flappin about
15 Jun 14:52 - Owen: Bats! Jewels!
15 Jun 19:26 - Dave: Can someone bring cooking oil
15 Jun 23:15 - Dave: Horde! No talking about GoT.
15 Jun 23:15 - Dave: Just saying now.
15 Jun 23:15 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: I called it.
15 Jun 23:15 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: Let it be known.
15 Jun 23:35 - Joe Jarman: You know nothing swarbrick Jones!!
15 Jun 23:36 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: <Media omitted>
16 Jun 04:01 - Tegan: nice :)
16 Jun 08:21 - Bongo: Not a huge fan of that last episode
16 Jun 08:21 - Bongo: Oh wait I'll shut up if people haven't seen it yet
16 Jun 08:25 - Owen: I can't believe that dynaruas shacked up with tommen!!!!
16 Jun 08:26 - Owen: It makes no sense. It sounds like I made it up!
16 Jun 08:26 - Bongo: All I'll say is, king Geoffrey coming back as a zombie was a bit of a shocker
16 Jun 08:34 - Alex Bunn: Joffrey*
16 Jun 08:36 - Bongo: No I mean the other king, king Geoffrey
16 Jun 08:37 - Bongo: <Media omitted>
16 Jun 08:38 - Bongo: When we found out one of the dragons was hitler my mind was blown
16 Jun 08:46 - Owen: Stanos was a ice giant all along.
16 Jun 08:47 - Owen: ANd JaN snooo was a figment or a pirate's imagination.
16 Jun 08:52 - Owen: But in all seriousness: heavy metal poisoning was a bit of a lame way to kill off all the main characters. Did the show get cancelled suddenly and the writers had to come up with something in the spur of the moment?
16 Jun 09:29 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: What's the next hype train then?
16 Jun 09:29 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: True detective? Rick and Morty?
16 Jun 09:30 - Lorna: True detective!

16 Jun 10:15 - Dave: True detective, fo sho
16 Jun 10:18 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: I dunno, bit apprehensive about true detective
16 Jun 10:19 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: Rick and Morty I am thoroughly psyched for
16 Jun 10:19 - Dave: Sames - but equally i trust them to do the right thing
16 Jun 21:59 - Dave: Sup c town. When y'all home?x

16 Jun 22:16 - Dave: Just wondering what everyone's plans are

17 Jun 15:22 - Sam Roberts: We could hang it over the side
17 Jun 15:25 - Dave: Or inside...
17 Jun 15:33 - Owen: Get a dragon.
17 Jun 15:33 - Owen: They said no barbecues, not no dragons.
17 Jun 17:26 - Bongo: No there's an asterix at the bottom that says "strictly no dragons"
17 Jun 19:06 - Owen: Damn those bastards. I was totally going to bring my dragon that definitely exists
18 Jun 09:50 - Lora: Peeps. If you're around old st tonight, my company has a pop-up shop in the station for London tech week and I'm running a FREE HAPPY HOUR tonight 6-8p. Come by if you can! I said its free, didn't I? üçªüç∑üç∏üéâ
