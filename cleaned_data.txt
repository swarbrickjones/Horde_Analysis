"11 Oct 12:13 2013","Dave Mendes da Costa","Ah, how about on the Tuesday? Anyone..."
"11 Oct 12:14 2013","Bunn","Hi Dave. Not really a big fan of Stewart Lees rants. I guess i'm not his audience \ Unless you can change my mind"
"11 Oct 12:16 2013","Sam Roberts","Don't think I've seen any of his biz, I love standup though,  I'll geek up a bit this weekend n maybe get a ticket!"
"11 Oct 12:16 2013","Bunn","Its not your typical standup! (There are no jokes)"
"11 Oct 12:19 2013","Dave Mendes da Costa","Hmm, I see what you mean. I find that Stewart Lee is like good horror, the comedy is often in what he doesn't say and how you fill it in. He's very theatrical but bit in a camp way and he's true to his comic roots and honest. I think he's really funny. But that's just me... X"
"11 Oct 12:20 2013","Bunn","We'll watch some tonight a la casa and decide"
"11 Oct 12:22 2013","Dave Mendes da Costa","That seems fair. Let me know your conclusions. X"
"11 Oct 12:24 2013","Sam Roberts","I conclude that if regulation doesn't work out, you've got a fine future in arts review!"
"11 Oct 12:25 2013","Bunn","Which one should we watch? \ Ps. Shaggy add bongo! \ So we can rinse him"
"11 Oct 12:31 2013","Dave Mendes da Costa","Mike will advise. His episodes 'Stewart Lee's comedy vehicle' are good and his show If You Prefer A Milder Comedian Please Ask For One is great, especially the cider part at the end. X"
"11 Oct 12:42 2013","Shaggy","I've seen his show where he talks about Cameron, I think it was funny, if a bit odd, but I also think that most his humour was lost on my ignorant self"
"11 Oct 12:43 2013","Bunn","I think it takes a while to 'get' him"
"11 Oct 12:44 2013","Phil 2","His show about cameron was weak sauce no matter how long you watched it. Maybe his other stuff is better though."
"11 Oct 12:58 2013","Bunn","Dayum. Sexy Spanish girl in pret just gave me a badass wink and grin \ Awww yeah \ Weekend approacheth"
"11 Oct 12:59 2013","Phil 2","You got your cast off yet? Maybe you can do fun, 2 handed activities with her."
"11 Oct 13:00 2013","Dave Mendes da Costa","It's high ten time"
"11 Oct 13:04 2013","Shaggy","Go bunnster!!! \ Have you raped her yet? \ For those of you who don't have the privilege of having watched deathstalker it's a reference, not a vulgar jape"

"13 Oct 21:58 2013","Sam Roberts","Hey Y'all,  my brother just released this game which is pretty cool, I'm pretty proud of the whole thing so if you want to check it out it's called barcode wars and looks like this (all free) \ <Media omitted> \ If you fancy downloading it'd it would do him a favour, and he loves people critisizing his stuff if you find any bugs"

"13 Oct 22:11 2013","Bunn","Looks like someone already thought of your bros idea"
"13 Oct 23:20 2013","Sam Roberts","Hmmm I'll have to have a look at that! \ Android only atm, apparently that takes 5 mins to release, ios takes a couple of weeks,  so he's getting all the bugs out before he sends it in"

"13 Dec 18:49 2013","Sam Roberts","Prices?  Availability \ And did you see the memo? All messages need to be sent with a tps report. So if you could go ahead and fill that out, that'd be great"

"13 Dec 23:48 2013","Sam Roberts","I think you should come anyway, I've always wanted a galtically awesome awkward situation"
"13 Dec 23:50 2013","Mike Prime","I just remembered, I think cate is still on this thread..."

"29 Dec 11:58 2013","Owen","Are we getting trains now? Also what colour is my name on wassap?"
"29 Dec 13:12 2013","Cate","Brown. What's the closest station?"
"29 Dec 13:15 2013","Owen","I don't know.  Sam said something about trains. I liked the idea of hiring a car, but then again I can't drive and mainly liked the idea of getting drunk with shaggy distracting the driver until we careered into a hedge."
"29 Dec 13:20 2013","Sam Roberts","One car and some people on trains, I think you were down for car-ing?"
"29 Dec 13:23 2013","Dave Mendes da Costa","Car would be great if there are people happy to drive. Phil, are you still game? X"
"29 Dec 13:28 2013","Owen","Since we can't stay on the first wouldn't it be best for everyone to go by car?"
"29 Dec 13:47 2013","Cate","Owen makes a lot of sense. Also Sam, what train station would we go to?"
"29 Dec 13:48 2013","Dave Mendes da Costa","Last time we went to brokenhurst broklesby"
"29 Dec 13:49 2013","Cate","Seriously?!"
"29 Dec 13:48 2013","Dave Mendes da Costa","Brockenhurst even"
"29 Dec 13:49 2013","Cate","That place name like my name!! \ No. No it isn't. As you were..."
"29 Dec 13:49 2013","Dave Mendes da Costa","Heh, too much excitment \ Are you training or carrying cate? \ Urg, carring"
"29 Dec 13:55 2013","Sam Roberts","Could get two cars, I'd prefer train though tbh, trains are fine on the 1st, about 2 hours to waterloo every half hour. Cars a bit cheaper, trains are nicer"
"29 Dec 14:03 2013","Bunn","What was the price for two cars? Did tegan look into that last time? I can drive \ Also. We have accumulated two bags of unidentified clothing in our house. If you think you might own some of these items please come and pick them up before i chuck them out in a couple of weeks time"
"29 Dec 14:23 2013","Dave Mendes da Costa","Marth reckoned that two cars with four in each would be around 34 quid each. \ How many are going?"
"29 Dec 14:33 2013","Sam Roberts","13 I think, 7 seater an option?"
"29 Dec 14:40 2013","Dave Mendes da Costa","Could get a couple of 7s. Marth worked it out as 46 each that way."
"29 Dec 14:50 2013","Vanessa","I'm already training it. The station in arriving at is called Lymington Town. Is that right Sam? \ Bunny is there a dark red herringbone bomber jacket in there?"
"29 Dec 15:04 2013","Owen","Don't we need at least one car to get us from brocksbursy leminghurst town (or whatever its called) to sam's?"
"29 Dec 15:03 2013","Dave Mendes da Costa","Could taxi"
"29 Dec 15:08 2013","Vanessa","I'm arriving at around 10pm so I'll figure it out when I get there"
"29 Dec 15:20 2013","Sam Roberts","Probably taxi for v then, which leaves a 7 and a 5, or a 7 and 5 by train \ Def need one car, mainly for ease / booze runs / flexibility \ Station is lymington, or Brockenhurst. Brock is a bit further but easier trains, lymington is 1 more change \ So depends on whether whoever's driving is up for a slightly longer pickup *lascivious wink at marth*"
"29 Dec 15:23 2013","Owen","Me and eliza will do the same thing as you sam."
"29 Dec 15:24 2013","Sam Roberts","Awesome sauce, we can plan pranks to play on Bunny"
"29 Dec 15:23 2013","Dave Mendes da Costa","You're walking aren't you Sam?"
"29 Dec 15:24 2013","Owen","Scratch that... we will do the same thang as whoever has the keys to the house."
"29 Dec 15:24 2013","Sam Roberts","I bought a unicycle just for this!"
"29 Dec 15:25 2013","Owen","Well add mine and eliza's unicycles and you will have a tricycle.  Just like a grown up little boy."
"29 Dec 15:28 2013","Shaggy","Wazzzzuuuuuuuuuuiuup"
"29 Dec 15:29 2013","Sam Roberts","Sup"
"29 Dec 15:30 2013","Owen","Hi shaggy."
"29 Dec 15:30 2013","Sam Roberts","So I think we should stick to the e-list"
"29 Dec 15:30 2013","Owen","?? \ Elist?"
"29 Dec 15:30 2013","Sam Roberts","Car: teeg n dave, shag marth, pton and oliza \ Leaves bunn, cate, rob, V and me by train / taxi \ Did I miss anyone?"
"29 Dec 15:32 2013","Owen","7 peeps. \ Sounds good. \ If we get there early is there a pub?"
"29 Dec 15:36 2013","Shaggy","There is \ And I know where"
"29 Dec 15:37 2013","Owen","What style of shoes do you like shaggy?"
"29 Dec 15:37 2013","Shaggy","Skate shoes"
"29 Dec 15:36 2013","Dave Mendes da Costa","Sounds good. I'm out of work at 1230. What time are we leaving?"
"29 Dec 15:38 2013","Shaggy","I'm free all day"
"29 Dec 15:38 2013","Owen","Do you like stilettos? \ Me too"
"29 Dec 15:39 2013","Shaggy","Not for myself, but yes"
"29 Dec 15:53 2013","Sam Roberts","There's a good pub across the road and a great pub 5 mins drive away"
"29 Dec 18:27 2013","Martha","Can't be arsed to read 153 new whatsapp messages. What's up folks? \ Big festive love to you all from Xav & me in Brussels xx"
"29 Dec 18:28 2013","Dave Mendes da Costa","There's a car crew and a train crew. These are mentioned about 10 messages ago. Can only stay until the 1st. Gonna be playing with cards. Need booze. X"
"29 Dec 18:33 2013","Bunn","And drugs would be nice"
"29 Dec 19:30 2013","Owen","Anyone know where to get some hallucinogens? Mushrooms or summat?"
"29 Dec 19:34 2013","Dave Mendes da Costa","Tegs and I are thinking of training down if it's just gonna be one 7 seater car."
"29 Dec 20:51 2013","Bunn","Still asking around"
"29 Dec 22:23 2013","Bongo","Just catching up on these messages, is everyone heading down tomorrow or tues?"
"29 Dec 22:59 2013","Sam Roberts","31st, guess that's Tuesday \ That leaves 2 seats in the car? Also can team shagmarth be in charge of sorting that out?"
"29 Dec 23:07 2013","Bongo","I guess I'll train it down with you lot in the day then. \ Those clothes are mine btw, I'll take them off your hands next time I'm round."
"30 Dec 11:58 2013","Shaggy","Why is there a train crew if we all have to be back at the same time? All in car makes more sense"
"30 Dec 11:59 2013","Cate","I would rather go by car, is there room in a car for me? X"
"30 Dec 11:59 2013","Shaggy","And it's an aweful long way to go for one night anyway. Just sayin"
"30 Dec 12:00 2013","Cate","Let's go todaaay!"
"30 Dec 12:04 2013","Bunn","Just come here Cate if you're bored today \ Its miserable outside today :("

"30 Dec 12:42 2013","Bunn","Gonna throw this (potentially) controversial suggestion out there \ NYE at Croydon Road?"
"30 Dec 12:44 2013","Sam Roberts","I'm easy,  anywhere with all you beautiful people and some tunes is good for me \ Ideally some naughty salts as well, anyone got some thoughts on that \ ?"
"30 Dec 12:47 2013","Dave Mendes da Costa","I guess that it is a bit of a mission if we're off the next day. Would have been great to see the sea though."
"30 Dec 12:49 2013","Shaggy","In this weather you might as well squint your eyes and look at the ripples on the puddles in our garden"
"30 Dec 12:49 2013","Dave Mendes da Costa","Heh, perhaps I can take a trip out on your garden boat."
"30 Dec 12:50 2013","Tegan","Point taken- it's not really the weather for a walk.  Let's visit the sea in the spring time."
"30 Dec 12:50 2013","Sam Roberts","You'll have to fight the foxes first \ Thinking about food and people, phil / marth, you know some roast stuff we can have cold? Like, do a ham in the morning maybe? \ And can you do veggies for the veggies dave?"
"30 Dec 12:52 2013","Dave Mendes da Costa","Roast red peppers are great cold"
"30 Dec 12:53 2013","Bunn","Ok this seems to be gathering momentum. Lets see what everyone else says. What would have been spent on travel can be spent on more food \ Vanessa will be reimbursed cos she's already bought a train ticket"
"30 Dec 12:55 2013","Vanessa","I've also got a bottle of vodka and rum ready to be cracked open!"
"30 Dec 12:55 2013","Sam Roberts","I feel pretty good about this actually, bantsmas was awesome"
"30 Dec 12:55 2013","Dave Mendes da Costa","Agreed, though she should try and get a refund if possible."
"30 Dec 13:09 2013","Vanessa","It wasn't a lot so don't worry about it"
"30 Dec 13:09 2013","Dave Mendes da Costa","I'm happy to chip in V. Also very happy to help with food."
"30 Dec 13:10 2013","Vanessa","Teaches me a lesson for being too organised"
"30 Dec 13:13 2013","Cate",":/"
"30 Dec 13:15 2013","Shaggy","Not sure it's one of those things in life that you need a lesson for, but yes, your fault"
"30 Dec 13:16 2013","Vanessa","Thanks mom"
"30 Dec 13:15 2013","Dave Mendes da Costa","Is anyone not up for relocation to c town?"
"30 Dec 13:35 2013","Eliza Bott","Owen and I are fine either way."
"30 Dec 16:06 2013","Martha","Damn, seriously? I agree, a lot cheaper, but cottage last year was sooooo epic"
"30 Dec 16:08 2013","Sam Roberts","Agreed but I'd say cos of the people, not the place"
"30 Dec 16:17 2013","Martha","7 reasons why: (1) disco room, separated with a curtain from (2) awesome chill out room with more sofas than a room ever needs pushed into a circle, with (3) disco lights. (4) a kitchen with a table we sit and play cards around and eat around that's not covered with crap. (5) a garden to chill out in intermittently throughout the evening, where we're less likely to get stabbed, and (6) a clean, comfy bed with fresh sheets to lay your head on when the sun is rising and your body is blissfully fragile. And (7) the coast of England to enjoy with close friends and a glass of orange juice on New Year's Day. Yay?"
"30 Dec 16:23 2013","Cate","Yay!"
"30 Dec 16:25 2013","Tegan","Awww, Marth, you're such a poet! I'm easy either way x"
"30 Dec 16:29 2013","Bunn","<Media omitted> \ Our table is NOT covered in crap \ (I cleaned. I took offence to that one)"
"30 Dec 16:32 2013","Sam Roberts","(Bunn cleaned. He took offence to that one)"
"30 Dec 16:34 2013","Bunn","We could substitute new years day walk by the sea with something in london together?"
"30 Dec 16:55 2013","Tegan","Do you guys really not fancy it?"
"30 Dec 16:59 2013","Sam Roberts","I'm getting way more into the idea of c-town by the minute! \ We've got twice the people as last year, and we'll have the place all nice for you ladies"
"30 Dec 17:00 2013","Dave Mendes da Costa","Fancy a hand getting it ready tonight? Perhaps in testing the sofa out."
"30 Dec 17:03 2013","Sam Roberts","Hehe in my experience that rarely ends in the place getting tidier!"
"30 Dec 17:03 2013","Dave Mendes da Costa","You can trust me..."
"30 Dec 17:04 2013","Sam Roberts","Sofa's free and waiting for you if you're around though"
"30 Dec 17:04 2013","Dave Mendes da Costa","Woot. There's a plan to meet Chris Alford tonight if anyone's up for that. X"
"30 Dec 17:06 2013","Bunn","Yeah i am. But whats the plan? All iv heard is flimsyness"
"30 Dec 17:08 2013","Dave Mendes da Costa","Sounds like a rerun of the last brick lane night. Any better suggestions?"
"30 Dec 17:11 2013","Sam Roberts","Partying? Blurgh! I intend to drink some fine scotch and play some games, sleep well and get cracking for tomorrow"
"30 Dec 17:15 2013","Tegan","Better suggestions please- on the facebook page If possible,  to keep Chris in the loop"
"30 Dec 17:31 2013","Bunn","Cool"
"30 Dec 17:47 2013","Dave Mendes da Costa","Sounds like the plan is to meet at the big chill in kings cross."

"30 Dec 17:51 2013","Cate","Haven't eaten yet, soonest I'd get to kings cross is about 830-9. Still worth it?"
"30 Dec 17:51 2013","Dave Mendes da Costa","I'd have thought so. Can keep in touch. X"
"30 Dec 17:52 2013","Tegan","Where are you Cate? I haven't eaten yet either, so we could grab something around there."

"30 Dec 20:36 2013","Sam Roberts","We're going on a big ol' shop just now, any special requests from morrissons? Also if possible keep track of receipts and shit, we'll make sure no one's lost out at the end"
"30 Dec 20:39 2013","Martha","Fab, thanks guys! Treats for the morning: OJ, bacon butties etc? Also: nice roasting potatoes (I'll roast 'em for tomorrow soir). Let me know if you can't and I'll pick up en route tomorrow xx \ Port! (I have a feeling that was good last time?) and BUBBLES!!!!! I can get nice shit cheaply from waitrose around the corner from me (they have a deal). Yes?"
"30 Dec 21:05 2013","Dave Mendes da Costa","Veggie sausages x lots. Crisps. Onion rings, both crisps and oven cooked, peppers for roasting x lots, in fact lots of veggies so we can cook. So potatoes, aubergine, chick peas x lots, courgettes. ONIONS. \ Garlic too \ And chillis \ And some berlotti beans \ Please"

"07 Jan 11:47 2014","Shaggy","Rotten tomatoes seems to consistently disagree with me, or at least it used to and now I never use it. Or any ratings site, word of mouth is best for this sort of thing, bar only to own impressions"

"07 Jan 14:07 2014","Owen","Perhaps you just have terrible taste in films shaggy. Also if it consistently disagrees with you then it is an excellent system, you just need to do the opposite of what it says."
"07 Jan 14:54 2014","Shaggy","It's not excellent, it's terrible, just like bbc weather. If I have to change my mindset just so that one system works as well as others, it's a failure as a product"
"07 Jan 15:08 2014","Owen","Can you give me examples of where it is wrong?"
"07 Jan 15:09 2014","Shaggy","Like I said I haven't used it since its conception"

"07 Jan 15:10 2014","Bunn","<Media omitted>"
"07 Jan 15:10 2014","Shaggy","I know it was bad \ And everyone knows rotten tomatoes don't get any better"
"07 Jan 15:12 2014","Owen","I think you may be confusing the website with the fruit."
"07 Jan 15:56 2014","Sam Roberts","Science time! Give us 3 films you really like, and 3 you really don't.  Newer films would be better, and no cheating!"
"07 Jan 16:04 2014","Shaggy","I had a browse already: rush was a great film, 89 is perhaps overrated but I'll let it slide. Snatch is 73 which I think is too low, it's certainly a million times better than rush, but perhaps it's an old film. Pitch black, that came out same time as snatch, is 57 and a failure? Well that's bullshit, it's an excellent film. I know exactly the soppy heart wrenching and gut warming films they would rate highly and it's not at all aligned to my tastes"
"07 Jan 16:15 2014","Bunn","Eurgh. Shaddap already. This is not bants"
"07 Jan 16:15 2014","Sam Roberts","That's bad testing! It means nothing if you do it blind, you're basically saying you found 3 films you kind of agree with"
"07 Jan 16:16 2014","Bunn","No1 cares about your moanig shaggy \ Moaning*"
"07 Jan 16:18 2014","Owen","Also 57% is very close to fresh. The only problem I have with rotten tomatoes is the binary nature of fresh/rotten.  If you just go by percentage instead it is more accurate."
"07 Jan 16:18 2014","Sam Roberts","Pitch black was a solid 57, enjoyable but not particularly great"
"07 Jan 16:18 2014","Shaggy","No one cares about *your* moaning bunn"
"07 Jan 16:19 2014","Owen","Better than crap. Not as good as great."
"07 Jan 16:20 2014","Shaggy","That's not at all what I said Sam"

"14 Jan 18:35 2014","Hannah","Guys would you rather have teeth for pubes or pubes for teeth?"
"14 Jan 18:36 2014","Tegan","Teeth for pubes.  Otherwise you'd have to develop a whale-like method of eating which would be awkward at dinner parties."
"14 Jan 18:36 2014","Dave Mendes da Costa","Teeth for pubes \ For reasons stated"
"14 Jan 18:36 2014","Tegan","Good question Hannah. Touching on deep and important issues."
"14 Jan 18:37 2014","Shaggy","Bank \ Or rather monument \ What kind of teeth? Molars would be ok"
"14 Jan 18:39 2014","Sam Roberts","Ah yeah"
"14 Jan 18:40 2014","Tegan","Are they set in, so that pube maintenance would literally be pulling teeth? I sort of imagined then jangling about"

"14 Jan 18:43 2014","Hannah","I think teeth for pubes as only few people would know your secret \ Unless of course you made whipping them out a great party trick"
"14 Jan 18:44 2014","Shaggy","Wouldn't everyone have that? \ I thought it was like an evolutionary question"
"14 Jan 18:45 2014","Bunn","Just you \ Sex would be weird if everyone had it \ Probably quite painful too"
"14 Jan 18:45 2014","Tegan","Nah,  it makes more sense if it's everyone"
"14 Jan 18:46 2014","Bunn","A lot of danger of getting chomped"
"14 Jan 18:46 2014","Tegan","Otherwise theres no rationale for it happening at all"
"14 Jan 18:46 2014","Shaggy","Living on the edge, baby"
"14 Jan 18:46 2014","Bunn","Its a 'would YOU rather' question though"
"14 Jan 18:47 2014","Tegan","You'd probably develop some kind of defense"
"14 Jan 18:47 2014","Shaggy","That's very egocentric"
"14 Jan 18:47 2014","Tegan","Like an armadillo \ Is also negative banter"
"14 Jan 18:47 2014","Bunn","I guess if everyone got asked the question and made a choice \ Then if they disnt have a mouth full of pubes \ It would be safe to assume they went for the teeth for pubes option \ And you could have weird teeth crunching sex"
"14 Jan 18:49 2014","Tegan","Beautiful"
"14 Jan 18:49 2014","Shaggy","Not from behind"
"14 Jan 18:49 2014","Bunn","That might be the only option in this weird fantasy world"

"14 Jan 18:52 2014","Tegan","Always having hair in your mouth might be one of the worst feeling things"

"14 Jan 19:09 2014","Sam Roberts","I've spent too long thinking about this \ But I'm down for pubes for teeth \ You could trim them right down, and I think having a Johnson ringed with teeth is like saying goodbye to sex"
"14 Jan 19:12 2014","Mike Prime","I refuse to read the rest of this conversation \ Wouldn't teeth for pubes look like awesome ivory underwear \ Id go that"
"14 Jan 19:24 2014","Tegan","That's how I was picturing it, Mike \ Kinda tribal"

"21 Jan 14:38 2014","Tegan","Earlier showing is best- can people make 6.30 for dinner? Advantage of the wharf is the cheap tuesday which I am keen to take advantage of"

"21 Jan 15:50 2014","Tegan","I agree. With Lize. Hard to agree with Owen here. That is to say, not eating before a 3 hour movie will make me cross. Meet at 6? I'm going to vote GBK because the veggie selection at byron looks half arsed, but I could be persuaded by the pain of others for Scottish meat.  If it were a thing."

"05 Feb 14:34 2014","Tegan","You guys have a little mouse. He is very sweet, but should probably live somewhere else. \ Or as Owen would say, ÓÅì."
"05 Feb 15:49 2014","Shaggy","Her name M-M-M-Monster."
"05 Feb 16:11 2014","Bongo","Maybe she'll have epic battles with the rat. We should arm her and throw a training montage. \ And film the results \ Make lots of money \ And move to brazil"
"05 Feb 16:18 2014","Bunn","Home made humane mouse trap anyone? \ Little engineering project"
"05 Feb 16:27 2014","Shaggy","We have a glue trap. I suggested we also put spikes and poison on it."

"05 Feb 17:37 2014","Shaggy","Would you rather: use a glue trap and butcher said mouse with a cleaver or capture her with a humane mouse trap and throw outside to die in the freezing cold hinted by canning town ghetto predators? \ I'm allergic to cats, so fuck you"
"05 Feb 17:39 2014","Bunn","Yeah we cant get a cat cos of Shaggy's dumb allergies"
"05 Feb 17:41 2014","Tegan","Maybe we should keep it,  and put a waistcoat on it,  and pet it and pet it and pet it?"
"05 Feb 17:43 2014","Martha","Replace shaggy with a cat? \ ... joke?"
"05 Feb 17:43 2014","Shaggy","Hmmm....I could use a better place to live..."
"05 Feb 17:45 2014","Sam Roberts","How about a pet that eats mice, but doesn't trigger allergies? \ There's that python going in Bristol, that would be cool"
"05 Feb 17:46 2014","Bongo","Didn't we use the glue trap the. Throw it in the snow last time?"
"05 Feb 17:46 2014","Shaggy","Perfect! I propose we name it Cate"
"05 Feb 17:46 2014","Bongo","I don't think it gets much more inhumane than that"
"05 Feb 17:47 2014","Shaggy","Not true. Freezing is one if the better ways to die"
"05 Feb 17:48 2014","Sam Roberts","We all eat animals, I don't think we can consistently cry over the slightly uncomfortable death of vermin \ Also, Pete got one with a hammer once, I've always been a bit jealous of that"
"05 Feb 18:05 2014","Tegan","That was a terrible sorry.  If mice had a bible, that mouse would almost certainly be jesus."
"05 Feb 18:06 2014","Shaggy","And they would learn not to live in out houses and eat our food. We all live dairy tales. Except the bible. It's terrible"
"05 Feb 18:06 2014","Dave Mendes da Costa","Adam Wills joined"

"05 Feb 18:18 2014","Sam Roberts","Drink ? Salsa if I can be bothered. It's not looking good. We could do speakers maybe?"
"05 Feb 18:21 2014","Bunn","That'd be nice to get done. I'll txt xav \ Wait. Tube strike. We'll do it next week"
"05 Feb 18:22 2014","Sam Roberts","Hah, for sure!"
"05 Feb 18:54 2014","Tegan","Does this mean there is no plan?"
"05 Feb 19:22 2014","Shaggy","I wouldn't rely on those guys to have a plan"
"05 Feb 20:11 2014","Sam Roberts","We've got a lot of plans, that's the easy part!"

"24 Mar 13:34 2014","Owen","The sum of all the natural numbers is equal to (-1/12). This is crazy! Mathematicians arise and explain!"
"24 Mar 13:37 2014","Sam Roberts","What do you mean by natural numbers? It usually refers to counting numbers, which you can't sum"
"24 Mar 13:37 2014","Owen","1+2+3+4......"
"24 Mar 13:38 2014","Sam Roberts","You can't sum that, you can sum OVER the natural numbers, but you can't add them"
"24 Mar 13:39 2014","Owen","Why not?"
"24 Mar 13:39 2014","Sam Roberts","Email me whatever you're looking at, before Bunn notices there's maths on the horde"
"24 Mar 13:40 2014","Owen","Numberphile sum of natural numbers youtube. \ There are two proofs.  One of which uses the reimann zeta function."
"24 Mar 13:52 2014","Mike Prime","Lol, bad horde chat. If you analytically continue the Riemann zeta function and evaluate at -1 that's what you get. Kinda cheating though. As written the series is clearly divergent."
"24 Mar 13:58 2014","Owen","I don't really get what makes a series divegent though. Because 1/1+1/2+1/3 +1/4... is divergent. Even though it feels like it shouldn't be. \ Why is it cheating?"
"24 Mar 14:04 2014","Mike Prime","This is quite complicated... Zeta(x) is well defined for real x>1. For x<= 1 the series is not convergent. There's a thing called analytic continuation where roughly you find a function which agrees with your function where it is defined and is analytic (read infinitely differentiable) on a compact subset of the complex numbers. \ But the analytic continuation is not the same as the original function. So it doesn't make sense to use the series definition of zeta for x<1 and say zeta(-1) = 1+2+3+...."
"24 Mar 14:10 2014","Owen","That is what they guy did in the video.  He did zeta(2) and then took away 2.zeta (-2) or something.  I forget exactly how he did it. It feels like cheating."
"24 Mar 14:14 2014","Mike Prime","We should start a nerd horde group or something..."
"24 Mar 14:15 2014","Owen","Nah. Let the prols that inhabit this thread learn something. \ Also apparently 1-1+1-1+1-1.... is divergent.  Which makes no sense!"
"24 Mar 14:24 2014","Dave Mendes da Costa","Well it doesn't converge to anything. Depending on how you cluster the sums it appears it could converge to 0 or 1. In general for an infinite series to be convergent the underlying sequence being summed must converge to zero."
"24 Mar 14:26 2014","Sam Roberts","It's been ages since we've had a pointlessly nerdy argument about something, it's not a much fun sober and writing, let's get drunk and do this again sometime"

"03 Apr 10:06 2014","Owen","Interesting. Apparently like 70% people think farage won the debate according to the guardian. \ I personally don't care. I just don't think that in a democracy politicians really have that much power. Gove is trying his best to fuck up education and still isn't really making a dent."
"03 Apr 10:32 2014","Dave Mendes da Costa","From all accounts I'm reading Andrew Lansley's Health and Social Care Act has essentially privatised the NHS. I'd keep my eyes on politicians - it's when we stop watching them that the shit hits the fan."
"03 Apr 10:34 2014","Owen","What yah gonna do. As long as I don't have to pay for health insurance. \ Which I never will. If any politician suggested such a thing there would be a recall election or a vote of no confidence."

"03 Apr 18:37 2014","Mike Prime","Thanks for the link Marth. My gut definitely says it would be dumb to leave the EU, but all the arguments I see either for or against it seem very vague and notional... \ Also I reckon the yougov poll was probly skewed by the fact that people hate clegg"
"03 Apr 19:11 2014","Owen","I would like to see stats on how much import and export tax is saved by being in the EU. \ Also I think the reasons for being part of it are vague and complicated whereas the reasons for not being part basically boil down to saving a small amount of money and stopping immigration. \ I am fairly sure I am pro EU not because of its benefits (I don't really know what they are) but because I don't think the arguments against it are compelling. I am basically anti xenophobe. And apparently included in that set is being pro European union."
"03 Apr 20:06 2014","Tegan","I am pro eu because I fully dig passing through Borders with no problems \ Liberte! Egalite! Fraternite! \ (No accents, sorry French)"
"03 Apr 20:13 2014","Owen","I agree with you. That seems like a pretty small reason. I am fairly sure the EU is actually fairly inconsequential though."
"03 Apr 20:14 2014","Tegan","It feels like the closest thing to idealism which we still have a commitment to"
"03 Apr 21:29 2014","Sam Roberts","Arguing against the eu just feels like xenophobic atavism, I'd love it if there were poignant arguments for Britain to be a member for itself, but I feel completely happy with the idea that we make a net loss, with a huge gain in other countries \ Looking over the history of colonial Britain, I think we owe the world a bit"
"03 Apr 21:34 2014","Alan","The only way human society can overcome the worlds problems (environment, war, inequality, crime, etc) is through political globalisation. The eu is a big step in that direction. Even if Britain gained did gain by leaving the eu, theres bigger issues at play here than just being 1 or 2% wealthier. \ Anyone around for post work beers tomorrow night?"
"03 Apr 21:35 2014","Mike Prime","I don't know that immigration is good for other countries though. Seems like a lot of poorer countries lose a lot of bright people that way \ Beers beers beers. Just saw your email, Alan, where are you guys off to?"
