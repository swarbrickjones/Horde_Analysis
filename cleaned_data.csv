"11 Oct 12:14 2013","Bunn","Hi Dave. Not really a big fan of Stewart Lees rants. I guess i'm not his audience // Unless you can change my mind"

"11 Oct 12:16 2013","Bunn","Its not your typical standup! (There are no jokes)"
"11 Oct 12:19 2013","Dave","Hmm, I see what you mean. I find that Stewart Lee is like good horror, the comedy is often in what he doesn't say and how you fill it in. He's very theatrical but bit in a camp way and he's true to his comic roots and honest. I think he's really funny. But that's just me... X"
"11 Oct 12:20 2013","Bunn","We'll watch some tonight a la casa and decide"
"11 Oct 12:22 2013","Dave","That seems fair. Let me know your conclusions. X"

"11 Oct 12:31 2013","Dave","Mike will advise. His episodes 'Stewart Lee's comedy vehicle' are good and his show If You Prefer A Milder Comedian Please Ask For One is great, especially the cider part at the end. X"
"11 Oct 12:42 2013","Shaggy","I've seen his show where he talks about Cameron, I think it was funny, if a bit odd, but I also think that most his humour was lost on my ignorant self"
"11 Oct 12:43 2013","Bunn","I think it takes a while to 'get' him"
"11 Oct 12:47 2013","Phil","His show about cameron was weak sauce no matter how long you watched it. Maybe his other stuff is better though."
"11 Oct 12:58 2013","Bunn","Dayum. Sexy Spanish girl in pret just gave me a badass wink and grin // Awww yeah // Weekend approacheth"

"27 Dec 17:45 2013","Bongo","Shank? // So are we just chillin in c town tonight? Imma head round in about an hour or so I reckon."
"27 Dec 17:54 2013","Sam","C town it is, I'll show you my shank collection when you get here"
"27 Dec 18:02 2013","Bongo","Fucking trains, It's only two stops from work to my house and it's cancelled for 20 mins, AARG // Can we just all ride llamas to get places from now on?"
"27 Dec 18:31 2013","Sam","Llamas for the rich, goats for the poor"
"27 Dec 18:33 2013","Eliza","Tame the fox in your garden and have it pull you on a sleigh. That's the dream."
"27 Dec 18:34 2013","Bongo","Yes Eliza! Fox sleds"
"27 Dec 19:08 2013","Phil","Who is around tonite? There's food."
"27 Dec 19:06 2013","Sam","Amazing! I'm back in about an hour"
"27 Dec 19:06 2013","Bunn","Foxs cant be tamed"
"27 Dec 19:10 2013","Phil","You just need an iron fist."
"27 Dec 19:06 2013","Bunn","Forever the outcast. Forever the rebel"
"27 Dec 19:10 2013","Phil","Full of fox cookies // Chowda or shaudeur?"
"27 Dec 21:46 2013","Bongo","Shaudeuuur // Chowdaaa"
"28 Dec 12:10 2013","Bunn","Say it frenchie!"
"28 Dec 12:36 2013","Mike","Yo guys I'm finally getting round to getting my phone fixed, my number for the next week or so is 07849817488. // Won't be able to check whatsapp, so lemme know if any big tings a gwan // Happy new years to y'all I don't see! x"

"28 Dec 19:19 2013","Bunn","Woop woop // I'm excited // What do we need? // I new pack of phase 10?"
"28 Dec 19:21 2013","Vanessa","What's phase 10? // Sam do we need to bring blankets and stuff like that?"
"28 Dec 19:24 2013","Bunn","Phase 10 is a card game that everyone needs to love // And yeah we tool down sleeping bags and blankets last year // But we didnt really sleep"
"28 Dec 19:25 2013","Vanessa","I love card games! Watch out though I get very competitive"
"28 Dec 21:51 2013","Sam","We could do with some Stuff actually, anyone know someone?"
"28 Dec 21:51 2013","Owen","Poundland does haribo..."
"28 Dec 21:52 2013","Sam","Also heaps of booze. We ran out last time after buying enough for the chinese army"
"28 Dec 22:25 2013","Cate","I can't get any Stuff. Bunn bring cards against humanity!! Did you get the expansion pack yet?"
"28 Dec 22:26 2013","Bunn","Yeah i'll def bring it! // No expansion pack yet but could order off amazon maybe // Need to start asking around for md // Do we need to worry/make preparations for the storm thats coming in?"
"28 Dec 22:36 2013","Dave","I'll bring ropes for tying down the house. What would you do without me?"
"28 Dec 22:39 2013","Tegan","Is Shaggy at all enlightened?"
"28 Dec 22:39 2013","Sam","I'd panic dave. Panic and lose my house"
"28 Dec 22:52 2013","Vanessa","Storm? Again?"
"28 Dec 22:53 2013","Bunn","Appaz. Although i havnt seen any news or weather and im going on rumours"
"28 Dec 22:54 2013","Vanessa","Appaz? Is that the name of it?"
"28 Dec 22:57 2013","Bunn","Lol. I meant apparently but i shortened it cos im totes amaze"
"28 Dec 23:03 2013","Tegan","Might bugger up the trains // Sorry, bug up the trs"
"28 Dec 23:29 2013","Sam","Bgr p th trns // I got that first time bunn"
"28 Dec 23:31 2013","Bunn","Thats cos ur cool"
"28 Dec 23:35 2013","Sam","I don't know if it's cool or if we've spent so long living together that our menstrual cycles wre in line"
"28 Dec 23:55 2013","Bunn","I can believe that // But according to Spaced. Men are supposed to have this unspoken understanding of how to act out a gunfight // Which is a bit cooler than syncronised bleeding"
"29 Dec 09:56 2013","Phil","If a gunfight erupts I'll use you as a human shield and then sell your remains to a cat food company."
"29 Dec 10:03 2013","Bunn","Good to know you're on my side // Sneaky Austrian // Aren't you supposed to go Arnie? // And stand solo with a minigun in the heart of battle // And destroy everything in sight?"
"29 Dec 11:58 2013","Owen","Are we getting trains now? Also what colour is my name on wassap?"
"29 Dec 13:12 2013","Cate","Brown. What's the closest station?"
"29 Dec 13:15 2013","Owen","I don't know.  Sam said something about trains. I liked the idea of hiring a car, but then again I can't drive and mainly liked the idea of getting drunk with shaggy distracting the driver until we careered into a hedge."
"29 Dec 13:20 2013","Sam","One car and some people on trains, I think you were down for car-ing?"
"29 Dec 13:24 2013","Dave","Car would be great if there are people happy to drive. Phil, are you still game? X"
"29 Dec 13:28 2013","Owen","Since we can't stay on the first wouldn't it be best for everyone to go by car?"
"29 Dec 13:47 2013","Cate","Owen makes a lot of sense. Also Sam, what train station would we go to?"
"29 Dec 13:49 2013","Dave","Last time we went to brokenhurst broklesby"
"29 Dec 13:49 2013","Cate","Seriously?!"
"29 Dec 13:49 2013","Dave","Brockenhurst even"
"29 Dec 13:49 2013","Cate","That place name like my name!! // No. No it isn't. As you were..."
"29 Dec 13:50 2013","Dave","Heh, too much excitment // Are you training or carrying cate? // Urg, carring"
"29 Dec 13:55 2013","Sam","Could get two cars, I'd prefer train though tbh, trains are fine on the 1st, about 2 hours to waterloo every half hour. Cars a bit cheaper, trains are nicer"
"29 Dec 14:03 2013","Bunn","What was the price for two cars? Did tegan look into that last time? I can drive // Also. We have accumulated two bags of unidentified clothing in our house. If you think you might own some of these items please come and pick them up before i chuck them out in a couple of weeks time"
"29 Dec 14:24 2013","Dave","Marth reckoned that two cars with four in each would be around 34 quid each. // How many are going?"
"29 Dec 14:33 2013","Sam","13 I think, 7 seater an option?"
"29 Dec 14:41 2013","Dave","Could get a couple of 7s. Marth worked it out as 46 each that way."
"29 Dec 14:50 2013","Vanessa","I'm already training it. The station in arriving at is called Lymington Town. Is that right Sam? // Bunny is there a dark red herringbone bomber jacket in there?"
"29 Dec 15:04 2013","Owen","Don't we need at least one car to get us from brocksbursy leminghurst town (or whatever its called) to sam's?"
"29 Dec 15:04 2013","Dave","Could taxi"
"29 Dec 15:08 2013","Vanessa","I'm arriving at around 10pm so I'll figure it out when I get there"
"29 Dec 15:20 2013","Sam","Probably taxi for v then, which leaves a 7 and a 5, or a 7 and 5 by train // Def need one car, mainly for ease / booze runs / flexibility // Station is lymington, or Brockenhurst. Brock is a bit further but easier trains, lymington is 1 more change // So depends on whether whoever's driving is up for a slightly longer pickup *lascivious wink at marth*"
"29 Dec 15:23 2013","Owen","Me and eliza will do the same thing as you sam."
"29 Dec 15:24 2013","Sam","Awesome sauce, we can plan pranks to play on Bunny"
"29 Dec 15:24 2013","Dave","You're walking aren't you Sam?"
"29 Dec 15:24 2013","Owen","Scratch that... we will do the same thang as whoever has the keys to the house."
"29 Dec 15:24 2013","Sam","I bought a unicycle just for this!"
"29 Dec 15:25 2013","Owen","Well add mine and eliza's unicycles and you will have a tricycle.  Just like a grown up little boy."
"29 Dec 15:28 2013","Shaggy","Wazzzzuuuuuuuuuuiuup"
"29 Dec 15:29 2013","Sam","Sup"
"29 Dec 15:30 2013","Owen","Hi shaggy."
"29 Dec 15:30 2013","Sam","So I think we should stick to the e-list"
"29 Dec 15:30 2013","Owen","?? // Elist?"
"29 Dec 15:30 2013","Sam","Car: teeg n dave, shag marth, pton and oliza // Leaves bunn, cate, rob, V and me by train / taxi // Did I miss anyone?"
"29 Dec 15:32 2013","Owen","7 peeps. // If we get there early is there a pub? // Sounds good."
"29 Dec 15:36 2013","Shaggy","There is // And I know where"
"29 Dec 15:37 2013","Owen","What style of shoes do you like shaggy?"
"29 Dec 15:37 2013","Shaggy","Skate shoes"
"29 Dec 15:38 2013","Dave","Sounds good. I'm out of work at 1230. What time are we leaving?"
"29 Dec 15:38 2013","Shaggy","I'm free all day"
"29 Dec 15:38 2013","Owen","Do you like stilettos? // Me too"
"29 Dec 15:39 2013","Shaggy","Not for myself, but yes"
"29 Dec 15:53 2013","Sam","There's a good pub across the road and a great pub 5 mins drive away"
"29 Dec 18:27 2013","Marth","Can't be arsed to read 153 new whatsapp messages. What's up folks? // Big festive love to you all from Xav & me in Brussels xx"
"29 Dec 18:29 2013","Dave","There's a car crew and a train crew. These are mentioned about 10 messages ago. Can only stay until the 1st. Gonna be playing with cards. Need booze. X"
"29 Dec 18:33 2013","Bunn","And drugs would be nice"
"29 Dec 19:30 2013","Owen","Anyone know where to get some hallucinogens? Mushrooms or summat?"
"29 Dec 20:51 2013","Bunn","Still asking around"
"29 Dec 22:11 2013","Dave","Tegs and I are thinking of training down if it's just gonna be one 7 seater car."
"29 Dec 22:23 2013","Bongo","Just catching up on these messages, is everyone heading down tomorrow or tues?"
"29 Dec 22:59 2013","Sam","31st, guess that's Tuesday // That leaves 2 seats in the car? Also can team shagmarth be in charge of sorting that out?"
"29 Dec 23:07 2013","Bongo","I guess I'll train it down with you lot in the day then. // Those clothes are mine btw, I'll take them off your hands next time I'm round."
"30 Dec 11:58 2013","Shaggy","Why is there a train crew if we all have to be back at the same time? All in car makes more sense"
"30 Dec 11:59 2013","Cate","I would rather go by car, is there room in a car for me? X"
"30 Dec 11:59 2013","Shaggy","And it's an aweful long way to go for one night anyway. Just sayin"
"30 Dec 12:00 2013","Cate","Let's go todaaay!"
"30 Dec 12:04 2013","Bunn","Just come here Cate if you're bored today // Its miserable outside today :("
"30 Dec 12:18 2013","Vanessa","Perfect day for hot choco and baileys"
"30 Dec 12:19 2013","Dave","At work :("
"30 Dec 12:42 2013","Bunn","Gonna throw this (potentially) controversial suggestion out there // NYE at Croydon Road?"
"30 Dec 12:44 2013","Sam","I'm easy,  anywhere with all you beautiful people and some tunes is good for me // Ideally some naughty salts as well, anyone got some thoughts on that // ?"
"30 Dec 12:48 2013","Dave","I guess that it is a bit of a mission if we're off the next day. Would have been great to see the sea though."
"30 Dec 12:49 2013","Shaggy","In this weather you might as well squint your eyes and look at the ripples on the puddles in our garden"
"30 Dec 12:50 2013","Dave","Heh, perhaps I can take a trip out on your garden boat."
"30 Dec 12:50 2013","Tegan","Point taken- it's not really the weather for a walk.  Let's visit the sea in the spring time."
"30 Dec 12:50 2013","Sam","You'll have to fight the foxes first // Thinking about food and people, phil / marth, you know some roast stuff we can have cold? Like, do a ham in the morning maybe? // And can you do veggies for the veggies dave?"
"30 Dec 12:53 2013","Dave","Roast red peppers are great cold"
"30 Dec 12:53 2013","Bunn","Ok this seems to be gathering momentum. Lets see what everyone else says. What would have been spent on travel can be spent on more food // Vanessa will be reimbursed cos she's already bought a train ticket"
"30 Dec 12:55 2013","Vanessa","I've also got a bottle of vodka and rum ready to be cracked open!"
"30 Dec 12:55 2013","Sam","I feel pretty good about this actually, bantsmas was awesome"
"30 Dec 12:56 2013","Dave","Agreed, though she should try and get a refund if possible."
"30 Dec 13:09 2013","Vanessa","It wasn't a lot so don't worry about it"
"30 Dec 13:10 2013","Dave","I'm happy to chip in V. Also very happy to help with food."
"30 Dec 13:10 2013","Vanessa","Teaches me a lesson for being too organised"
"30 Dec 13:13 2013","Cate",":/"
"30 Dec 13:15 2013","Shaggy","Not sure it's one of those things in life that you need a lesson for, but yes, your fault"
"30 Dec 13:16 2013","Vanessa","Thanks mom"
"30 Dec 13:16 2013","Dave","Is anyone not up for relocation to c town?"
"30 Dec 13:35 2013","Eliza","Owen and I are fine either way."
"30 Dec 16:06 2013","Marth","Damn, seriously? I agree, a lot cheaper, but cottage last year was sooooo epic"
"30 Dec 16:08 2013","Sam","Agreed but I'd say cos of the people, not the place"
"30 Dec 16:17 2013","Marth","7 reasons why: (1) disco room, separated with a curtain from (2) awesome chill out room with more sofas than a room ever needs pushed into a circle, with (3) disco lights. (4) a kitchen with a table we sit and play cards around and eat around that's not covered with crap. (5) a garden to chill out in intermittently throughout the evening, where we're less likely to get stabbed, and (6) a clean, comfy bed with fresh sheets to lay your head on when the sun is rising and your body is blissfully fragile. And (7) the coast of England to enjoy with close friends and a glass of orange juice on New Year's Day. Yay?"
"30 Dec 16:23 2013","Cate","Yay!"
"30 Dec 16:25 2013","Tegan","Awww, Marth, you're such a poet! I'm easy either way x"
"30 Dec 16:29 2013","Bunn"," [MEDIA]  // Our table is NOT covered in crap // (I cleaned. I took offence to that one)"
"30 Dec 16:32 2013","Sam","(Bunn cleaned. He took offence to that one)"
"30 Dec 16:34 2013","Bunn","We could substitute new years day walk by the sea with something in london together?"
"30 Dec 16:55 2013","Tegan","Do you guys really not fancy it?"
"30 Dec 16:59 2013","Sam","I'm getting way more into the idea of c-town by the minute! // We've got twice the people as last year, and we'll have the place all nice for you ladies"
"30 Dec 17:01 2013","Dave","Fancy a hand getting it ready tonight? Perhaps in testing the sofa out."
"30 Dec 17:03 2013","Sam","Hehe in my experience that rarely ends in the place getting tidier!"
"30 Dec 17:04 2013","Dave","You can trust me..."
"30 Dec 17:04 2013","Sam","Sofa's free and waiting for you if you're around though"
"30 Dec 17:05 2013","Dave","Woot. There's a plan to meet Chris Alford tonight if anyone's up for that. X"
"30 Dec 17:06 2013","Bunn","Yeah i am. But whats the plan? All iv heard is flimsyness"
"30 Dec 17:09 2013","Dave","Sounds like a rerun of the last brick lane night. Any better suggestions?"
"30 Dec 17:11 2013","Sam","Partying? Blurgh! I intend to drink some fine scotch and play some games, sleep well and get cracking for tomorrow"
"30 Dec 17:15 2013","Tegan","Better suggestions please- on the facebook page If possible,  to keep Chris in the loop"
"30 Dec 17:31 2013","Bunn","Cool"
"30 Dec 17:48 2013","Dave","Sounds like the plan is to meet at the big chill in kings cross."
"30 Dec 17:49 2013","Cate","Can I come? What's the details? X"
"30 Dec 17:50 2013","Bunn","7 o clock kings cross"
"30 Dec 17:51 2013","Cate","Haven't eaten yet, soonest I'd get to kings cross is about 830-9. Still worth it?"
"30 Dec 17:52 2013","Tegan","Where are you Cate? I haven't eaten yet either, so we could grab something around there."
"30 Dec 17:55 2013","Dave","Hell yeah Cate! I'm heading to the big chill bar near king cross now. Others should be around from 7. X // I'd have thought so. Can keep in touch. X"
"30 Dec 18:01 2013","Bunn","In other news we've managed to pick up some illicit substances for NYE"
"30 Dec 18:04 2013","Cate","I'm I kent & cooking now, so no candle lit dinner for us tonight Teegs. Will get in about 830, see ya soon!"

"30 Dec 18:41 2013","Bongo","Chris Alford no way, he must be king of some chilled out communist country in the jungle by now."
"30 Dec 18:55 2013","Bunn","Back from Guatemala // I'll ask to take a photo of his crown"
"30 Dec 19:06 2013","Bongo","Are you guys there now? I'm going to head over."
"30 Dec 19:06 2013","Dave","Come come. X // Hey cate, how's progress? X"
"30 Dec 19:59 2013","Owen","What illicits did you get bunn?"
"30 Dec 20:03 2013","Sam","We git 3g of md and 1g of coke // We're thinking basically booze, some tasty stuff around midnight and stuff for stuff"
"30 Dec 20:12 2013","Dave","Sounds goods peeps. We've got a quart of vodka and will help dish out the fodder. Xx"
"30 Dec 20:36 2013","Sam","We're going on a big ol' shop just now, any special requests from morrissons? Also if possible keep track of receipts and shit, we'll make sure no one's lost out at the end"
"30 Dec 20:39 2013","Marth","Fab, thanks guys! Treats for the morning: OJ, bacon butties etc? Also: nice roasting potatoes (I'll roast 'em for tomorrow soir). Let me know if you can't and I'll pick up en route tomorrow xx // Port! (I have a feeling that was good last time?) and BUBBLES!!!!! I can get nice shit cheaply from waitrose around the corner from me (they have a deal). Yes?"
"30 Dec 21:05 2013","Dave","Veggie sausages x lots. Crisps. Onion rings, both crisps and oven cooked, peppers for roasting x lots, in fact lots of veggies so we can cook. So potatoes, aubergine, chick peas x lots, courgettes. ONIONS. // Garlic too // And chillis // And some berlotti beans // Please"
"30 Dec 21:28 2013","Sam","That would be great marth. If Y'all up for it we should assign drinks, put that ¬£40 saving to good use! // I vote marth champagne, tegan red dave white, owen tequila eliza sambuca V is down a ticket so np, rob'll get vodka, cate's on other things ans we'll sort out port / beer / other between us"
"30 Dec 21:40 2013","Bunn","You forgot the rum // Haha"
"30 Dec 21:46 2013","Dave","I got vodka already. Reassign goods. // Yo Morrison's crew. How's the hunt?"
"30 Dec 21:59 2013","Shaggy","It closed at 8 today apparently, a fact which Google failed to inform me about"
"30 Dec 21:59 2013","Dave","Aw"
"30 Dec 21:59 2013","Shaggy","Instead I turned up to an empty store, and got this in the process: //  [MEDIA] "
"30 Dec 22:09 2013","Sam","Bunn's on rum then, rob on white // I'll accept one nice bottle of spirits, or 2 ballsack cheap ones with mixer"
"30 Dec 22:29 2013","Vanessa","I've got rum and vodka // Standard and Sailor Jerry"

"30 Dec 22:38 2013","Shaggy","So I guess ouzo, metaxa and absinth are out of the picture too?"
"30 Dec 22:39 2013","Sam","Points to anyone who brings something interesting and off list!"
"30 Dec 22:39 2013","Shaggy","And let's try to make cocktails with something other than coke this time"

"31 Dec 12:33 2013","Marth","Sure thing, and are we trying to keep to the budget of what we would have spent going to keyhaven? Today's rent day so I'm feeling especially poor!!"

"31 Dec 14:44 2013","Eliza","Afraid it's not looking good, O is very poorly. I think we're going to stay home, watch a film and go to bed at 12.01 like the boring married couple we are. :( Have an awesome time though, and we will make a New Years resolution to be a little less feeble."
"31 Dec 14:44 2013","Shaggy","He's ill, you're not, come over"
"31 Dec 14:45 2013","Eliza","Tempted... but I'd feel a bit mean leaving him alone and sick on New Years."

Snatch is 73 which I think is too low, it's certainly a million times better than rush, but perhaps it's an old film. Pitch black, that came out same time as snatch, is 57 and a failure? Well that's bullshit, it's an excellent film. I know exactly the soppy heart wrenching and gut warming films they would rate highly and it's not at all aligned to my tastes"

"14 Jan 18:36 2014","Tegan","Teeth for pubes.  Otherwise you'd have to develop a whale-like method of eating which would be awkward at dinner parties."
"14 Jan 18:36 2014","Dave","Teeth for pubes // For reasons stated"
"14 Jan 18:36 2014","Tegan","Good question Hannah. Touching on deep and important issues."

"24 Mar 13:58 2014","Owen","I don't really get what makes a series divegent though. Because 1/1+1/2+1/3 +1/4... is divergent. Even though it feels like it shouldn't be. // Why is it cheating?"
"24 Mar 14:04 2014","Mike","This is quite complicated... Zeta(x) is well defined for real x>1. For x<= 1 the series is not convergent. There's a thing called analytic continuation where roughly you find a function which agrees with your function where it is defined and is analytic (read infinitely differentiable) on a compact subset of the complex numbers. // But the analytic continuation is not the same as the original function. So it doesn't make sense to use the series definition of zeta for x<1 and say zeta(-1) = 1+2+3+...."
"24 Mar 14:10 2014","Owen","That is what they guy did in the video.  He did zeta(2) and then took away 2.zeta (-2) or something.  I forget exactly how he did it. It feels like cheating."
"24 Mar 14:14 2014","Mike","We should start a nerd horde group or something..."
"24 Mar 14:15 2014","Owen","Nah. Let the prols that inhabit this thread learn something. // Also apparently 1-1+1-1+1-1.... is divergent.  Which makes no sense!"
"24 Mar 14:24 2014","Dave","Well it doesn't converge to anything. Depending on how you cluster the sums it appears it could converge to 0 or 1. In general for an infinite series to be convergent the underlying sequence being summed must converge to zero."

"03 Apr 19:11 2014","Owen","I would like to see stats on how much import and export tax is saved by being in the EU. // Also I think the reasons for being part of it are vague and complicated whereas the reasons for not being part basically boil down to saving a small amount of money and stopping immigration. // I am fairly sure I am pro EU not because of its benefits (I don't really know what they are) but because I don't think the arguments against it are compelling. I am basically anti xenophobe. And apparently included in that set is being pro European union."
"03 Apr 20:06 2014","Tegan","I am pro eu because I fully dig passing through Borders with no problems // Liberte! Egalite! Fraternite! // (No accents, sorry French)"
"03 Apr 20:13 2014","Owen","I agree with you. That seems like a pretty small reason. I am fairly sure the EU is actually fairly inconsequential though."
"03 Apr 20:14 2014","Tegan","It feels like the closest thing to idealism which we still have a commitment to"
"03 Apr 21:29 2014","Sam","Arguing against the eu just feels like xenophobic atavism, I'd love it if there were poignant arguments for Britain to be a member for itself, but I feel completely happy with the idea that we make a net loss, with a huge gain in other countries // Looking over the history of colonial Britain, I think we owe the world a bit"
"03 Apr 21:34 2014","Alan","The only way human society can overcome the worlds problems (environment, war, inequality, crime, etc) is through political globalisation. The eu is a big step in that direction. Even if Britain gained did gain by leaving the eu, theres bigger issues at play here than just being 1 or 2% wealthier. // Anyone around for post work beers tomorrow night?"
"03 Apr 21:35 2014","Mike","I don't know that immigration is good for other countries though. Seems like a lot of poorer countries lose a lot of bright people that way // Beers beers beers. Just saw your email, Alan, where are you guys off to?"
"03 Apr 21:54 2014","Alan","Vietnam (probably).  To Danang"

"28 May 10:59 2014","Sam","Some gangster turned off auto spacing and auto capitalisation, that's what happened // I feel like I'm graduating Henry, imgur app has taken my hours for too long!"
"28 May 11:01 2014","Henry","there is better stuff on reddit, try /r/showerthoughts and /r/Britishproblems // what tv are ppl watching atm? im stuck at home ill and need something to binge"
"28 May 11:04 2014","Angela","Have you watched the US office? Great binging fodder"
"28 May 11:05 2014","Henry","Actually I never saw that I always assumed it was rubbish"
"28 May 11:06 2014","Angela","Get past the first few episodes, which try to copy the uk one, and then it gets going and is really funny"
"28 May 11:09 2014","Owen","It was some very subtle trolling Sam. I kept just thinking my fingers had got fatter or something. // Yeah once you get to the second series it is a lot better. // The first series just try to copy the British one. But because they are American they don't seem to get the humor."
"28 May 11:10 2014","Angela","They can't do it half as cringey and awkward // I liked it from the first few episodes though"
"28 May 11:16 2014","Henry","sweet, full day of tv binging sorted"
"28 May 11:31 2014","Mike","The toilets at my work are like a Faraday cage, so I can't look at reddit at work without my boss seeing :("

"28 May 11:39 2014","Bunn","Gross dude // My toilet naps would be busted // Iv spent the morning listening to GoT audiobooks on youtube // So much easier than actually doing the reading"
"28 May 11:45 2014","Sam","You're my hero Bunn, taking lethargy to new levels // You listen while you work? I got a bollocking for wearing headphones once. I need a new job..."

"28 May 12:56 2014","Mike","Man your old place sounds dumb. Sometimes I just put my headphones in with no sound on, it's better than ambient noise!"
"28 May 13:05 2014","Tegan","I want headphones that play silence // Then I will know I live in the future"
"28 May 13:11 2014","Mike","Noise cancelling headphones aren't that expensive these days, like ¬£40 for a cheap pair?"
"28 May 13:24 2014","Shaggy","Cheap headphones that claim to do expensive things are a waste of money"
"28 May 13:29 2014","Mike","I think expensive headphones are a waste of money, there I said it"
"28 May 13:30 2014","Shaggy","Maybe on your ears"
"28 May 13:31 2014","Henry","I dunno man good headphones are heavenly,  I used to go thru a pair every six months till I shelled out for good ones, theyve lasted 5 years"
"28 May 13:43 2014","Mike","Yeah longevity is a good point. I leave mine at work though, use inner ear on commute, so doesn't matter so much. // I think audiophiles are kidding themselves though. Its like high end wine tasting."
"28 May 13:58 2014","Sam","I'm pretty sure it's just what your used to, going back to computer speakers when you've been listening to real ones for a little while is painful, you never realise how bad the quality is // And I'll never forgive Vanessa for educating me about burgers. Now I know what they're supposed to taste like, I can't even finish a McDonald's"
"28 May 14:01 2014","Henry","its a hard life bro"
"28 May 14:12 2014","Bunn","That was her plan all alonh // Along* // You got schooled sukka // Legend goes shaggy had 3 maccyD bfasts on monday // And he doesnt remember it"

"28 May 15:16 2014","Owen","So it turns out that although your bosses seem to not want you taking a shit or wearing headphones they are perfectly happy with you spending the day on wassap Óêï"
"28 May 15:19 2014","Sam","Hah, I was just thinking the same, think I need to turn my phone off for the afternoon"
"28 May 15:21 2014","Bongo","Yea TL;DR // They need some sort of summarising feature to condense all of today's messages into a one liner"
"28 May 15:23 2014","Mike","In a meeting lol // A really long boring one"
"28 May 16:31 2014","Tegan","Noise cancelling headphones cancel out amvient noise when you're playing music // I just want them to play silence // Deafening silence // Arthur c clarke wrote about it many years ago and they still haven't been invented // Sci fi fail"
"28 May 16:38 2014","Catrin","Hey guys. Having drinks and dinner on the southbank later if anyone's up for it! Cxx"

"28 May 20:14 2014","Bongo","Do you like mellow stuff? // Wax tailor or hundred waters // Any of their albums"
"28 May 20:17 2014","Mike","If you like John Cage you should listen to the album of trees falling in the forest while no ones around to record them"

"29 May 12:27 2014","Alan","Anything goes really. Perhaps one of the pubs on the river near lb?"
"29 May 12:30 2014","Angela","Sounds lovely. If my work drinks don't materialise (pretty likely) and jason hasn't bought us tickets to the cinema already (semi-likely as he's very excited about xmen) then I'm in!"

"30 May 09:13 2014","Tegan","Rubbish horde // Lovely group of people"
"30 May 09:14 2014","Sam","That made a posse at most"
"30 May 09:14 2014","Shaggy","That was my hoard. Now it's my horde"
"30 May 09:15 2014","Mike","Can one of the original peeps do me a favour? Go to main menu, click on three dots, settings, chat settings, email conversation and email the whole horde chat as a text file to me? // Mine only goes back to when I broke my phone, wana do some stats on it!"
"30 May 09:17 2014","Hannah","Stats mike?"
"30 May 09:18 2014","Bunn"," [MEDIA] "

"30 May 10:39 2014","Owen","Mike you should do stats on who comments most. And who gets mentioned most. Then do the ratio of the two. Then we could finally have what we all have been waiting for: an objective measure of who is the most popular."
"30 May 10:39 2014","Henry","haha thats amazing, I didnt realise pig castration came under the remit of your job tegs"
"30 May 10:40 2014","Tegan","It's an agile role :)"

"30 May 10:40 2014","Henry","surely a normalised number of mentions is better, if you incorporate comment counts then prolific commenters would feature better...and yoid have to take into account time spent in the group too"
"30 May 10:41 2014","Tegan","Doing some post workshop networking there shags"
"30 May 10:41 2014","Shaggy","With my coworker lol"
"30 May 10:43 2014","Owen","No Henry. I think the person who doesn't comment much but gets mentioned a lot has the highest comment efficacy. And therefore is the objectively best person."
"30 May 10:44 2014","Tegan","Even if we keep calling them a cunt?"
"30 May 10:44 2014","Owen","Shaggy that link doesn't work for me.  Who is it?"
"30 May 10:44 2014","Henry","I think thats an assumption that needs testing before you can claim objectivity :)"
"30 May 10:44 2014","Shaggy","Ce moi"
"30 May 10:45 2014","Henry","plus tegs makes a good point how does it take into account sentiment?"
"30 May 10:45 2014","Owen","Owen Owen Owen Owen Owen Owen owen"
"30 May 10:45 2014","Shaggy","Does that count as a self mention? Am I boosting my popularity of self-centredness?"
"30 May 10:45 2014","Henry","I wonder what the stats would be for proportion of whatsapping done on fridays"
"30 May 10:46 2014","Shaggy","Or Mondays"
"30 May 10:48 2014","Henry","would be quite interesting to do a sentiment analysis by day too, bet were all happier on fridays"
"30 May 10:51 2014","Hannah","http://m.youtube.com/watch?v=cU8ps6okoJ4 // Can we get stats on the number of times I post something hilarious and nobody replies?"

"30 May 16:36 2014","Bunn","Scruff + glitch mob + no money = me"
"30 May 16:39 2014","Hannah","Em I think there's silt tickets! Come? It's from midday till midnight at roundhouse x"

"17 Sep 22:40 2014","Tegan","Bum"
"17 Sep 22:40 2014","Owen","It's really good."
"17 Sep 22:40 2014","Tegan","I only need a phone game"
"17 Sep 22:41 2014","Owen","I am learning android to make a phone game with similar ideas. // What kind of phone game?"
"17 Sep 22:43 2014","Tegan","A building game // With pretty // All crowd sourced suggestions welcome"
"17 Sep 22:48 2014","Sam","Terraria. Best game ever"
"17 Sep 23:09 2014","Owen","There aren't  many good phone  building  games."
"17 Sep 23:10 2014","Sam","Ooh xconstructor"
"17 Sep 23:10 2014","Owen","Tiny tower was pretty addictive but it was one of those stupid wait  4 hours for something to  finish."
"17 Sep 23:10 2014","Sam","Not sure if it's on iPhone, but it's awesome"
"17 Sep 23:10 2014","Owen","X constructor? // That sounds good. What is it?"
"17 Sep 23:10 2014","Sam","I think that's it, where you build railway bridges and trains go over them // But if you build them badly, everyone dies"
"17 Sep 23:18 2014","Owen","Nice"
"17 Sep 23:34 2014","Joe","Hey Owen how good with android are you // I'm starting a coursesa course in a few days // Looking for others interested // Also I've been messing about with unity as well"
"18 Sep 00:24 2014","Owen","I'm about 1/4 of the way through my book. I have got the basics and am now using fragments. It's a pretty neat setup. Very scalable, but that means that you have to do quite a lot for even the simplest app. Fortunately android released a development  kit pre bundled with eclipse which takes away loads of the legwork  that existed when android was first  released. I haven't  looked into unity, mainly because I don't have an apple. What's  it like?"
"18 Sep 09:01 2014","Mike","What's the predictions for Scotland vote then?"
"18 Sep 09:02 2014","Angela","I think it'll be a no, what do you think?"
"18 Sep 09:02 2014","Mike","I reckon no too, morbidly curious to see a yes vote though..."
"18 Sep 09:02 2014","Angela","I didn't think I was bothered but actually I would be a bit sad if they voted yes // Like being dumped by someone I completely took for granted all these years"
"18 Sep 09:03 2014","Mike","Lol // And all those cyclists. Damn // 55% no, that's my bet"
"18 Sep 09:06 2014","Sam","Cyclists?"
"18 Sep 09:06 2014","Marth","Reckon 52% no - a bit too close for comfort"
"18 Sep 09:06 2014","Sam","I'm not sure I care about the really. The important thing is it sets the stage for Cornish independence, which is way overdue // *result // They actually have their own currency, take that Scotland"
"18 Sep 09:08 2014","Mike","Yeah think about all those gold medals we got in the cycling! // I reckon no's are underreporting. I'd be surprised by a yes vote"
"18 Sep 09:13 2014","Angela","I agree, I think 55% at least for no"
"18 Sep 09:18 2014","Dave","I think I would be happy either way: excited for an independent Scotland, content to see an island united. // The underreporting point is true though the polls may not be very reliable. There was a chap from yougov on the radio the other day saying that polls are usually weighted to control for the way they are sampled however this process requires historical data"
"18 Sep 09:20 2014","Mike","There's no exit polls! Bullshit, where's the fun in that?"
"18 Sep 09:20 2014","Dave","There isn't any such data for this referendum but the weighting process has been done anyway which can skew the results"
"18 Sep 09:24 2014","Joe","Ungrateful Scots costing us a fortune yes or no, best just to cull the lot of em. Off to collect my dole money ÓêÖ"
"18 Sep 09:25 2014","Mike","You know betfair have already paid out on no? Thats pretty cocky..."
"18 Sep 09:26 2014","Angela","While they weight the results for sampling, they can't weight them for people lying. All the polls in 1992 predicted a labour win but it turned out that voting conservative was so uncool that people just didn't want to admit to it"
"18 Sep 09:26 2014","Dave","What happens if it's yes? Do they have to return the money?"
"18 Sep 09:27 2014","Angela","Probably voting no is seen as boring but actually people do want the safer option?"
"18 Sep 09:28 2014","Bunn","I'm for a yes vote"
"18 Sep 09:28 2014","Dave","Maybe, bit I wonder how many people, when in the ballot box, will let the excitement take over and change to yes"
"18 Sep 09:28 2014","Bunn","I bet they could have a more progressive country if they cut London loose // Great Britain is renamed, not-so-great-anymore Britain"
"18 Sep 09:32 2014","Krizia","I think the contrary actually happens in the ballot box a lot of people take the safe option or they change right there!"
"18 Sep 09:32 2014","Bunn","Not-as-united as before Kindom"
"18 Sep 09:33 2014","Krizia","I can't wait for this to be over! !! its boring at work all is Scott here there! ! Common"
"18 Sep 09:43 2014","Sam","They'll all be deported tomorrow, it'll be a lonely Friday for you!"
"18 Sep 09:49 2014","Krizia","Hehe well if I had a vote I would say yes!!! Let's start a revolution just for the sake of it!!"
"18 Sep 09:54 2014","Bunn","Thats the spirit!"
"18 Sep 09:56 2014","Dave","Yay!"
"18 Sep 09:57 2014","Adimina","If the Scots leave then soon enough we'll have Wales and the rest of Ireland jumping ship too // Then well just be Britain"
"18 Sep 09:57 2014","Bunn","Wales and Ireland dont have any oil // But i would quite like to see Wales go it alone // They could export loveliness"
"18 Sep 10:05 2014","Mike","Let's have a London referendum! Fuck everyone else! // Except Hatfield"
"18 Sep 10:07 2014","Owen","I hope it is a yes. That would be an awesome experiment. // One that we can observe but that really doesn't  affect us much."
"18 Sep 10:08 2014","Sam","Whisky prices will go up // It's the only effect on my life I can think of"
"18 Sep 10:11 2014","Mike","Gold medals in cycling will plummet"
"18 Sep 10:11 2014","Vanessa","England is starting to produce some good whiskey"
"18 Sep 10:11 2014","Mike","People keep ignoring the big issues // Do we still get to claim someone from the uk won Wimbledon?"
"18 Sep 10:12 2014","Owen","Will they? That depends on  a lot of factors: Import  and export tax between England and Scotland, whether the new scoring government  decides to subsidise whiskey, EU trade rules."
"18 Sep 10:14 2014","Sam","It won't go down"
"18 Sep 10:14 2014","Mike","It also depends on whether we decide to put Hadrian's wall back up"
"18 Sep 10:14 2014","Sam","We're only losing Hoy, and without the superior british bikes and training, he'll dwindle to a hollowed has been"
"18 Sep 10:21 2014","Bunn","He'll dwindle to a hollowed has been anyway // Ha! // Ageing // I think claiming Andy Murray as our own has been a gigantic push for Scottish independence"
"18 Sep 10:24 2014","Owen","It could go down sam. It is a big industry. Wouldn't be suprised if a Scotland in charge of thier own economy decide to subsidise it loads. That coupled with EU trade laws would mean no export tax to Britain. // France subsidise thier wine industry considerably."
"18 Sep 11:55 2014","Bunn","http://www.imgur.com/gallery/KAh1J // Brilliant comments hidden in code //  [MEDIA]  //  [MEDIA]  //  [MEDIA]  //  [MEDIA]  // Lol"
