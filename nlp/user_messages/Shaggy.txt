everyone knows rotten tomatoes don't get any better.i had a browse already rush was a great film is perhaps overrated but i'll let it slide snatch is which i think is too low it's certainly a million times better than rush but perhaps it's an old film pitch black that came out same time as snatch is and a failure well that's bullshit it's an excellent film i know exactly the soppy heart wrenching and gut warming films they would rate highly and it's not at all aligned to my tastes.no one cares about your moaning bunn.that's not at all what i said sam.if it's consistent it doesn't matter if it's blind or not.no because that would assume i have knowledge of what is and isn't and i don't i picked a film i watched recently a film i know is excellent and a film i know i would enjoy.based on rt i don't know if i wouldn't enjoy a film or some arsehole wouldn't enjoy a film moreover i don't know if a film is good so that i would enjoy it or good so it gets loads of nominations and i dot

it something.oh hella yeah grats dude grats.wo.one in one out loz left so krizia is allowed back i in.cananabananalism.cananabanananananananabatman.cos she was too loud.david blaine mendes da costa.or a really long an thin penis.i will be but not in my dress.premier in is cheap but not very atmospheric.that depends what the goal is.brain is attached to your spine.i don't even know what externalities are.yeah sign me up.woah £ count me out.yeah that's the good shit.actually that's bongos birthday i think we should sign him up as a wrestler.and use that drawing up to come up with the costume drawing app.wow that's some of the ugliest clothes i've ever seen.errr.there was in fact a similar project on kick starter potato salad that went from one potato salad for this guy to k project somehow it's worth trying sam.have you heard of the movie constipation.hard to tell it hasn't come out yet.l like.big black foot long mic and stand.brazzers work in mysterious ways.faggestbin..hobo i mean hbp thanks autocorrect.lol smash it with a sword.the dude.ooo i have a purple gown maybe i should go.wow that's an awesome t shirt.to be fair you did something similar in c town you didn't lock us out but we came home to you passed out on the couch and house full of smoke because you forgot about pasta which boiled out and completely burned luckily we didn't have any

that came to visit.that bridge really rubbed off on your artichoke.age of wonders ii i think it's on sale.laughing gas has a legitimate use though what are they going to do about that.surely it doesn't include that.how will they feed their marijuana plants.it was although it wasn't actually used for that purpose so we safely class it as a legal high.well you could look at the chemical composition so if it looks like mdma behaves like mdma but is plant food then i'd argue it's probably not really plant food i would also argue that if we know that it's not plant food then so does the

restaurants should reward wastelessness let's assume it's a word by giving discounts to customers who finish their food or vice versa penalise those who waste it.also good.they are not compulsory i'm not worried about me wasting food it's others.that's again wasteful.what about cooties that's unsanitary.doggy and bagging are we still talking about food.nah i think that's fair too i like what pret do i just wish they didn't brag about it so much.but mega cheap.cos otherwise it goes to ducking lizards.i think we should collectively start a restaurant of international food where all waiters are stereotypes and then we can test these ideas we can even get a lizard pit.i think first candidate is tegan mostly due to size or maybe peter dinklage.oh sorry misread.well are they nuclear lizards maybe putin.i don't want that kind of clientele that's my one veto.assassinations leave at least one less person to pay.you grow the lizards but that's not the primary business model.lizards aren't that discriminatory step is profit not global domination.i have humble aspirations i want a restaurant where people don't waste food that's a good picture but you get a down vote for using a link.if a

kanye.but kanye would be upset.running some errands at the moment can't assist i'm afraid.apparently tube is hotter than transport for kettle is allowed to be.i mean transport for cattle too hot can't think.sauna line.how many times none of that shit on the horde.fapathon ✊.it's th july i think we should do beers and what not.yes obvz.i will probs be there at going to welcome drinks for newbie.lol

downstairs i'm in morrisons looking for pizza bases it ain't lookin good i think we should just order food or i can buy frozen pizza.yay it's half price.i don't even get it.maybe it's time like seven sisters.so show of hands who's still true to the detectives.nah shit went down.and frozen pizza..wow do we get to do that i mean cos we know you so by transit ivory transitivity.actually maybe we can do that tonight drink of choice port.i'm going to go home in half an hour i'll be there by.we are on strike until eliza can make pizza again.liquid beer is allowed today also port.we have frozen pizzas and bong is keen to make some lamb chops but nothing planned apart from that.but i just bought port cockburn no less going to be more.where park.how about rooftop with garden.of course.about
