I agree, a lot cheaper, but cottage last year was sooooo epic.7 reasons why: (1) disco room, separated with a curtain from (2) awesome chill out room with more sofas than a room ever needs pushed into a circle, with (3) disco lights. (4) a kitchen with a table we sit and play cards around and eat around that's not covered with crap. (5) a garden to chill out in intermittently throughout the evening, where we're less likely to get stabbed, and (6) a clean, comfy bed with fresh sheets to lay your head on when the sun is rising and your body is blissfully fragile. And (7) the coast of England to enjoy with close friends and a glass of orange juice on New Year's Day. Yay?.Fab, thanks guys! Treats for the morning: OJ, bacon butties etc? Also: nice roasting potatoes (I'll roast 'em for tomorrow soir). Let me know if you can't and I'll pick up en route tomorrow xx.Port! (I have a feeling that was good last time?) and BUBBLES!!!!!
