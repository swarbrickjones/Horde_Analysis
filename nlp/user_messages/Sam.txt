collection when you get here.llamas for the rich goats for the poor.amazing i'm back in about an hour.we could do with some stuff actually anyone know someone.also heaps of booze we ran out last time after buying enough for the chinese army.i'd panic dave panic and lose my house.bgr p th trns i got that first time bunn.i don't know if it's cool or if we've spent so long living together that our menstrual cycles wre in line.one car and some people on trains i think you were down for car ing.could get two cars i'd prefer train though tbh trains are fine on the st about hours to waterloo every half hour cars a bit cheaper trains are nicer.i think seater an option.probably taxi for v then which leaves a and a or a and by train def need one car mainly for ease booze runs flexibility station is lymington or brockenhurst brock is a bit further but easier trains lymington is more change so depends on whether whoever's driving is up for a slightly longer pickup lascivious wink at marth.awesome sauce we can plan pranks to play on bunny.i bought a unicycle just for this.sup.so i think we should stick to the e list.car teeg n dave shag marth pton and oliza leaves bunn cate rob v and me by train taxi did i miss anyone.there's a good pub across the road and a great pub mins drive away.st guess that's tuesday that leaves seats in the car also can team shagmarth be in charge of sorting that out.i'm easy anywhere with all you beautiful people and some tunes is good for me ideally some naughty salts as well anyone got some thoughts on that.you'll have to fight the foxes first thinking about food and people phil marth you know some roast stuff we can have cold like do a ham in the morning maybe and can you do veggies for the veggies dave.i feel pretty good about this actually bantsmas was awesome.agreed but i'd say cos of the people not the place.bunn cleaned he took offence to that one.i'm getting way more into the idea of c town by the minute we've got twice the people as last year and we'll have the place all nice for you ladies.hehe in my experience that rarely ends in the place getting tidier.sofa's free and waiting for you if you're around though.partying blurgh i intend to drink some fine scotch and play some games sleep well and get cracking for tomorrow.we git g of md and g of coke we're thinking basically booze some tasty stuff around midnight and stuff for stuff.we're going on a big ol' shop just now any special requests from morrissons also if possible keep track of receipts and shit we'll make sure no one's lost out at the end.that would be great marth if y'all up for it we should assign drinks put that £ saving to good use i vote marth champagne tegan red dave white owen tequila eliza sambuca v is down a ticket so np rob'll get vodka cate's on other things ans we'll sort out port beer other between us.bunn's on rum then rob on white i'll accept one nice bottle of spirits or ballsack cheap ones with mixer.the more the

the meat rendezvous by the roastables.asap marth only you and v and liza missing.happy new year everyone.much love marth and everyone who made the pile of people such a nice place to chill out i'd like to get cash sorted soon if possible could you all check your emails and get back to me today if pos x.no idea there's one by my bed if you need some juice just now though x.seconded that vodka

something.pray to the gods of internet and try refreshing.v and i are going burgering in angel for aome good clean booze free fun anyone want to join it'll be five guys at.i think they have one made out of vegetarians any good.i have done some research they have a veggie option where you get the bun and all the veg you can fit in it like grilled shrooms and onions which are done on a separate veg grill.anyone for a cine trip tomorrow i'd like to see the new ben stiller thing.science time give us films you really like and you really don't newer films would be better and no cheating.that's bad testing it means nothing if you do it blind you're basically saying you found films you kind of agree with.pitch black was a solid enjoyable but not particularly great.i care bunn without booze i need all the pointless arguments i can get.yeah but you automatically pick the ones that aren't.hah maybe we should make our own whatsapp with black boxes and hookers.i'm there.i'm so hungry tempted to go for a pre burger burger to take the edge off.i hate getting better taste i can't handle mcdonalds anymore i've got to schlep all the way to kfc.greatest meal of all time maximun once a week just got

one plate.both elevenses is for everyday.after bunn shaves the sink looks like someone put a banger in an orange.i'd that huge out just really close to the camera.i'm going to have to kick y'all off netflix i can never use it at the mo there's an option to upgrade from to users if anyone wants to chip in instead £ a month.yeah been a week or so probably when it was bugging that time yeah changed then gave it all out again i thought you could kick everyone when you feel like it doesn't seem to work though.np for now i've got a stream for next time though.yeah as of a couple of weeks ago £ a month extra gets you more.nice one let the semi legal streaming continue should mean everyone can use whenever.sup party people i'm going burgering with v this evening some place in hoxton y'all fancy a snack and shake.lucky chip in the sebright arms about mins walk from hoxton station i think v's working so meet there at.so i had to look up that bukowski place god's drool does it look delicious i

cineworld as well if that helps.anyone on for slavery tonight.for me more late working.every movie is a popcorn movie think i'll grab a sandwich to eat in there want anything from tesco.yeah and yeah.i thought it was pretty optimistic actually it's basically the sorry of a man getting away from all his rich superficial friends and starting a life of outdoor living where he gets to travel and lot and meet a wide variety of people.we went for a couple of drinks there with v one time it's ok too busy semi authentic mexican place they get pissy if you don't order food though you going.wo
