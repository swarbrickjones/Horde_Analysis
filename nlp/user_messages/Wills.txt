 [MEDIA] . Ummm teegz... Did you get on the right plane? Things good my end ;).Leaver of the dark farts. (Congrats man - I always knew you had it in you! ;).Hey! So I'm gonna cook up veggie lasagna at mine for around 7pm. Whoever wants in just lemme know and I'll make sure I make enough! For those who want to come and crack open a few beers with me beforehand, pop over at 4 for drinking and catchup time!! For those who are (a) so hungover they can't see (b) going to be 3 hours late no matter how hard they try, or (c) just feelin' plain lazy. Then aim for 4, and arrive just in time for dinner... Oh, and Happy Easter Sunday!!. P.s., for those who can't remember where I live, postcode is e5 8nb! Number 59... Hope to catch some of your fine faces later :).Just bring drinks!.Good choice Sam - Looking forward to seeing you for breakfast tomorrow! It's always good to stagger attendance....Can we drive?? Just for a bit?.Dave - it doesn't sound like you're in any fit state to drive... Worse, if Angela's suspicions are correct, you may be a zombie, and we all know that zombies shouldn't drive (they never check their mirrors)... Will you need Sam and I to come and navigate stellar eastwards for the day? We can buy sailor hats! X.I assume it's too late for poor young teegz! (@T: sorry hun!) Plus, with two undead aboard the boat, it strengthens the argument that Sam and I should drive (which, under other circumstances may otherwise be a relatively weak argument).Yessss... My work is done. Am on my way!.10-0 it's time to break records!!. Sorry Brazil!.I'm out in stokey watching... Alas, zi Germans have been too conservative to break records today. Only 7-0, they should really work harder... They even let Brazil score....Did you place a bet? Or are you more 'I'm just the smug dude who can predict the score - no biggie' ;). ... But in all fairness, poor brasssil.Cool - I'll pop along too!.How big is 25 ft? Pics?
