function and evaluate at 1 that s what you get kinda cheating though as written the series is clearly divergent.this is quite complicated zeta x is well defined for real x 1 for x 1 the series is not convergent there s a thing called analytic continuation where roughly you find a function which agrees with your function where it is defined and is analytic read infinitely differentiable on a compact subset of the complex numbers but the analytic continuation is not the same as the original function so it doesn t make sense to use the series definition of zeta for x 1 and say zeta 1 1 2 3.we should start a nerd horde group or something.your mum is a divergent series bunn mathbants.alright alright i just made a new group for nerdy stuff tech support etc added some of you but feel free
