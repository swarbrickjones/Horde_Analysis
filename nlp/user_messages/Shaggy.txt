browse already rush was a great film 89 is perhaps overrated but i ll let it slide snatch is 73 which i think is too low it s certainly a million times better than rush but perhaps it s an old film

it s not at all aligned to my tastes.no one cares about your moaning bunn.that s not at all what i said sam.if it s consistent it doesn t matter if it s blind or not.no because that would assume i
