30 Sep 2013 10:26 - Vanessa: Why is it that group Whatsapp doesn't notify you of messages?
30 Sep 2013 10:26 - Shaggy: It does. My phone vibrates every two damn minutes

30 Sep 2013 13:39 - Bunn: Urgh. I just had a lunch presentation that i couldnt keep myself awake in
30 Sep 2013 18:42 - Dave Mendes da Costa: Urg, me too. Learning about the legal parameters of confidentiality on Monday morning is a downer for the rest of the day. I might go MadMen and keep a bottle whisky at work for such occasions.
1 Oct 2013 11:52 - Sam Roberts: Beers beers beers beers beers beers beeeeeeeeeeers tomorrow? I haven't seen Y'all in too long! London bridge is always easy, if anyone objects to the george we can definitely find another place x

1 Oct 2013 13:09 - Martha: ...the second was just because I got excited
1 Oct 2013 14:00 - Vanessa: I have a client tomorrow evening so it'll be a no from me :(

8 Oct 2013 11:06 - Bunn: You didnt tell me that happened!!
8 Oct 2013 11:06 - Phil 2: Sweet zombie tranny jesus. I just found this on me phoneola.
8 Oct 2013 11:12 - Sam Roberts: Mercy that was a pretty justice-heavy evening
8 Oct 2013 11:13 - Sam Roberts: You got any other pics? I don't think that's pj at his sexiest
8 Oct 2013 11:18 - Dave Mendes da Costa: Shit. Did PJ get arrested on his stag do?
8 Oct 2013 11:39 - Bunn: I hope hooters offered him a job
8 Oct 2013 11:39 - Bunn: He looks great!
8 Oct 2013 11:41 - Sam Roberts: Hah yeah, but only for 5 minutes for having illegal levels of party animal
8 Oct 2013 11:41 - Sam Roberts: Think shaggy's got some more pics, he's being all coy today though

8 Oct 2013 14:49 - Vanessa: That's cool
8 Oct 2013 14:56 - Shaggy: Where is the potato patch?
10 Oct 2013 23:03 - Dave Mendes da Costa: Sup horde? Who wants to see Stewart Lee on Thursday 7 November? Xx
11 Oct 2013 08:24 - Shaggy: Going to see trentm√∏ller on the 7th
11 Oct 2013 12:13 - Dave Mendes da Costa: Ah, how about on the Tuesday? Anyone...
11 Oct 2013 12:14 - Bunn: Hi Dave. Not really a big fan of Stewart Lees rants. I guess i'm not his audience
11 Oct 2013 12:15 - Bunn: Unless you can change my mind
11 Oct 2013 12:16 - Sam Roberts: Don't think I've seen any of his biz, I love standup though,  I'll geek up a bit this weekend n maybe get a ticket!
11 Oct 2013 12:16 - Bunn: Its not your typical standup! (There are no jokes)
11 Oct 2013 12:19 - Dave Mendes da Costa: Hmm, I see what you mean. I find that Stewart Lee is like good horror, the comedy is often in what he doesn't say and how you fill it in. He's very theatrical but bit in a camp way and he's true to his comic roots and honest. I think he's really funny. But that's just me... X
11 Oct 2013 12:20 - Bunn: We'll watch some tonight a la casa and decide
11 Oct 2013 12:22 - Dave Mendes da Costa: That seems fair. Let me know your conclusions. X
11 Oct 2013 12:24 - Sam Roberts: I conclude that if regulation doesn't work out, you've got a fine future in arts review!
11 Oct 2013 12:25 - Bunn: Which one should we watch?
11 Oct 2013 12:25 - Bunn: Ps. Shaggy add bongo!
11 Oct 2013 12:25 - Bunn: So we can rinse him
11 Oct 2013 12:31 - Dave Mendes da Costa: Mike will advise. His episodes 'Stewart Lee's comedy vehicle' are good and his show If You Prefer A Milder Comedian Please Ask For One is great, especially the cider part at the end. X
11 Oct 2013 12:42 - Shaggy: I've seen his show where he talks about Cameron, I think it was funny, if a bit odd, but I also think that most his humour was lost on my ignorant self
11 Oct 2013 12:43 - Bunn: I think it takes a while to 'get' him
11 Oct 2013 12:44 - Phil 2: His show about cameron was weak sauce no matter how long you watched it. Maybe his other stuff is better though.
11 Oct 2013 12:58 - Bunn: Dayum. Sexy Spanish girl in pret just gave me a badass wink and grin
11 Oct 2013 12:58 - Bunn: Awww yeah
11 Oct 2013 12:58 - Bunn: Weekend approacheth
11 Oct 2013 12:59 - Phil 2: You got your cast off yet? Maybe you can do fun, 2 handed activities with her.
11 Oct 2013 13:00 - Dave Mendes da Costa: It's high ten time
11 Oct 2013 13:04 - Shaggy: Go bunnster!!!
11 Oct 2013 13:04 - Shaggy: Have you raped her yet?
11 Oct 2013 13:06 - Shaggy: For those of you who don't have the privilege of having watched deathstalker it's a reference, not a vulgar jape
11 Oct 2013 13:14 - Dave Mendes da Costa: Sure shaggy...sure
11 Oct 2013 17:53 - Bunn: <Media omitted>
11 Oct 2013 17:55 - Shaggy: They forgot to take out the instruments this time?

11 Oct 2013 18:03 - Shaggy: Yeah whatever, staplewrist
11 Oct 2013 18:29 - Shaggy: So it turns out I didn't lose my keys, they were in the pocket in my bag, that I always put them in

11 Oct 2013 20:22 - Shaggy: That would be the only way I could graduate with a distinction
13 Oct 2013 21:58 - Sam Roberts: Hey Y'all,  my brother just released this game which is pretty cool, I'm pretty proud of the whole thing so if you want to check it out it's called barcode wars and looks like this (all free)
13 Oct 2013 21:58 - Sam Roberts: <Media omitted>
13 Oct 2013 22:01 - Sam Roberts: If you fancy downloading it'd it would do him a favour, and he loves people critisizing his stuff if you find any bugs
13 Oct 2013 22:02 - Vanessa: Android?
13 Oct 2013 22:02 - Sam Roberts: Def, I think I phone as well
13 Oct 2013 22:03 - Sam Roberts: iPhone rather
13 Oct 2013 22:03 - Vanessa: Can't find it
13 Oct 2013 22:03 - Sam Roberts: Ah I'll check, might be android only atm
13 Oct 2013 22:07 - Bunn: My barcode warrior is gonna be the champ
13 Oct 2013 22:07 - Bunn: I'll pwn all your asses
13 Oct 2013 22:07 - Vanessa: How did you find the app on iPhone?
13 Oct 2013 22:08 - Bunn: Oh i havnt yet
13 Oct 2013 22:08 - Bunn: Just talking smack
13 Oct 2013 22:08 - Sam Roberts: I didn't think of that... better to get some cheats off him!
13 Oct 2013 22:09 - Shaggy: <Media omitted>
13 Oct 2013 22:09 - Sam Roberts: Close
13 Oct 2013 22:11 - Bunn: Looks like someone already thought of your bros idea
13 Oct 2013 23:20 - Sam Roberts: Hmmm I'll have to have a look at that!
13 Oct 2013 23:21 - Sam Roberts: Android only atm, apparently that takes 5 mins to release, ios takes a couple of weeks,  so he's getting all the bugs out before he sends it in

11 Dec 2013 16:05 - Sam Roberts: I can get there for 7. Film at 7.40 or 8.50, so either quick beer and eat after or head to wahaca for some proper snacks and do the 8.50 showing. Fancy it marth? X

11 Dec 2013 17:22 - Martha: Feeling mighty knife-edge-esque fighting off some kind of ill, so it's an early bedtime for me. Also no beer. Do they do food in the pub?

11 Dec 2013 17:32 - Shaggy: Beeron
11 Dec 2013 17:35 - Martha: Just because I can't partake doesn't mean it's not a necessary location on the evening's itinerary!
11 Dec 2013 17:36 - Martha: But this girl will need snacks too. Pub has food right?
11 Dec 2013 17:44 - Sam Roberts: Pub has food, of a solid standard variety
11 Dec 2013 17:45 - Martha: Aight. Cat and canary at 7.  I think they do **crumble** :D
11 Dec 2013 19:00 - Mike Prime: Cat and canary is rammed, might have to go somewhere else for food
11 Dec 2013 19:10 - Martha: Running late, I'll be there in 10. Don't worry about food (but maybe do we need to get tickets sooner rather than later?) x
12 Dec 2013 17:15 - Tegan: Whose a-hippin and a-hoppin tonight? Plans gor meets and eats?

12 Dec 2013 17:40 - Tegan: I would imagine our pre-gig and your post-pint drinks will not converge. Probably should have used the other thingy. Doh.

13 Dec 2013 17:35 - Owen: How are we getting to cate's tomorrow? I vote train because I hate coaches.  But am willing to coach if I have to.
13 Dec 2013 17:50 - Sam Roberts: Could someone check prices / availability? We have to be there before 5
13 Dec 2013 17:57 - Owen: Could you?
13 Dec 2013 17:58 - Sam Roberts: Nope,  got this staff party thing
13 Dec 2013 17:59 - Sam Roberts: I'll manage via whatsapp
13 Dec 2013 18:48 - Mike Prime: Coach actually doesn't take much longer than train, and ends up right by her house
13 Dec 2013 18:48 - Mike Prime: Megabus is hella cheap but national express is nicer
13 Dec 2013 18:49 - Sam Roberts: Prices?  Availability
13 Dec 2013 18:50 - Sam Roberts: And did you see the memo? All messages need to be sent with a tps report. So if you could go ahead and fill that out, that'd be great

13 Dec 2013 18:54 - Sam Roberts: Report: tps
13 Dec 2013 18:55 - Mike Prime: For both buses latest still available is 12.30 ¬£18. For train you can leave whenever but its ¬£30 . both those are one way.
13 Dec 2013 18:55 - Bongo: Too verbose, try it keep it tight next time.
13 Dec 2013 19:03 - Sam Roberts: Coach! Book 6 pls, teeg dave shag phil bongo me?
13 Dec 2013 19:09 - Owen: Me and eliza will catch the train. It is ¬£35 return with a yp railcard and its an hour quicker and more comfy.
13 Dec 2013 19:09 - Shaggy: Train is actually 50, no railcards
13 Dec 2013 19:14 - Owen: How far is cate from the train station?
13 Dec 2013 19:14 - Owen: Whats her address?

13 Dec 2013 19:35 - Mike Prime: Bout 15-20 mins walk
13 Dec 2013 19:36 - Owen: Ok we will get the train then. See you then.
13 Dec 2013 19:44 - Mike Prime: Oh jus in case you guys don't know, me and cate broke up a few weeks ago and I'm not gona be there. I'm just helping cause I'm bored
13 Dec 2013 23:48 - Sam Roberts: I think you should come anyway, I've always wanted a galtically awesome awkward situation
13 Dec 2013 23:50 - Mike Prime: I just remembered, I think cate is still on this thread...
14 Dec 2013 02:38 - Martha: (18 return??) Then can someone book me a bus ticket too? And let me know when/where to be in the morning. I'm feeling hella shitty :( cough ick eww.

14 Dec 2013 11:06 - Martha: Owen and Eliza - what time train are you getting?
14 Dec 2013 11:06 - Shaggy: I'll book tickets now, Phil and bong already booked megabus so I guess I'll get the same, they are ¬£26.50 now.
14 Dec 2013 11:06 - Sam Roberts: One for me pls
14 Dec 2013 11:07 - Shaggy: Train *is* infinitely more comfortable and much more convenient too

14 Dec 2013 11:21 - Sam Roberts: Oh I need to be back in London by 2.30, that change things?
14 Dec 2013 11:22 - Shaggy: That's hella early.
14 Dec 2013 11:23 - Sam Roberts: Yup, probably easiest with a train open return?
14 Dec 2013 11:23 - Martha: Yay train crew!
14 Dec 2013 11:23 - Shaggy: There are early coaches but they are really easy to miss on a hangover
14 Dec 2013 11:24 - Shaggy: Ok cool, trains from paddington I think, what time shall we rendezvous?
14 Dec 2013 11:26 - Owen: 2:30 train from paddington its a deal.
14 Dec 2013 11:26 - Dave Mendes da Costa: Benefit of the coach is that it's 3 mins from Cate's place. Station is a half hour walk. X
14 Dec 2013 11:27 - Owen: No coach. Also was that ¬£26.50 each way?
14 Dec 2013 11:28 - Owen: If so the train is cheaper.
14 Dec 2013 11:28 - Shaggy: Not each way, return
14 Dec 2013 11:28 - Shaggy: Coach is definitely cheaper
14 Dec 2013 11:30 - Martha: The 2:45pm from Paddington takes 1hr20. Flexible return. Winner.
14 Dec 2013 11:30 - Martha: Screw that. It's to parkway.
14 Dec 2013 11:30 - Shaggy: Even with 30 mins walk it's still less than the coach
14 Dec 2013 11:32 - Martha: Aight, let's meet at 2:15 at Paddington to get supplies and the 2:30 train. Pew pew
14 Dec 2013 11:32 - Shaggy: Done. We can get tickets at the station
14 Dec 2013 11:34 - Owen: 2:30 train. No changes. Lets get many train beers!
14 Dec 2013 13:18 - Sam Roberts: How's everyone doing for time? Think shanglez and I are going to be close, could you grab some train beers for us as well O?
14 Dec 2013 13:30 - Owen: Ok
14 Dec 2013 13:31 - Owen: You have an hour. How is it going to be close?
14 Dec 2013 14:02 - Owen: Do we need to get you tickets as well?
14 Dec 2013 14:05 - Sam Roberts: I lack faith in time

16 Dec 2013 08:47 - Shaggy: Can't stop shaking, trying hard not to throw up
16 Dec 2013 09:22 - Martha: Is anyone there with you? Drink water, or even better, take lots of small sips of coke (for salts and sugar). Then dry salted crackers will help to soak up whatever heinous things are still in your bloodstream.
16 Dec 2013 09:23 - Owen: Did you go to work?
16 Dec 2013 09:23 - Martha: Failing that, call in a sicky and go to bed with a soft drink and a bucket x

16 Dec 2013 09:44 - Bunn: Hair of the dog is far better than Martha's tips
16 Dec 2013 10:15 - Martha: Next time Bunny comes as babysitter. Then he can eat all the dog hair he likes.
16 Dec 2013 12:29 - Phil 2: Seeing the thing that Shaggy turned into back at ours made me glad.I took the bus. The lonely, slow, shitty, boring, devoid-of-alcohol bus.
16 Dec 2013 12:31 - Owen: The train was hilarious and embarrassing. But it made the journey go quick.

27 Dec 2013 16:22 - Bunn: He'll be back
27 Dec 2013 16:23 - Sam Roberts: It's pretty badass to have a pet fox, what do they eat?
27 Dec 2013 16:25 - Eliza Bott: In my experience biscuits, pepperami and garlic bread...
27 Dec 2013 16:26 - Sam Roberts: I've got half a Christmas cake and some pork, no animal alive is about to turn that down
27 Dec 2013 17:07 - Hannah: <Media omitted>
27 Dec 2013 17:40 - Sam Roberts: Touch of bad news chaps, we've got green end (the river / party cottage) for the 31st but can't stay the night of the first

27 Dec 2013 17:44 - Sam Roberts: Whenever, afternoon sometime I guess

27 Dec 2013 17:50 - Bongo: So are we just chillin in c town tonight? Imma head round in about an hour or so I reckon.
27 Dec 2013 17:54 - Sam Roberts: C town it is, I'll show you my shank collection when you get here
27 Dec 2013 18:02 - Bongo: Fucking trains, It's only two stops from work to my house and it's cancelled for 20 mins, AARG
27 Dec 2013 18:05 - Bongo: Can we just all ride llamas to get places from now on?
27 Dec 2013 18:31 - Sam Roberts: Llamas for the rich, goats for the poor
27 Dec 2013 18:33 - Eliza Bott: Tame the fox in your garden and have it pull you on a sleigh. That's the dream.

27 Dec 2013 19:06 - Phil 2: Full of fox cookies
27 Dec 2013 20:59 - Phil 2: Chowda or shaudeur?

28 Dec 2013 19:21 - Vanessa: What's phase 10?
28 Dec 2013 19:22 - Vanessa: Sam do we need to bring blankets and stuff like that?
28 Dec 2013 19:24 - Bunn: Phase 10 is a card game that everyone needs to love
28 Dec 2013 19:24 - Bunn: And yeah we tool down sleeping bags and blankets last year
28 Dec 2013 19:24 - Bunn: But we didnt really sleep
28 Dec 2013 19:25 - Vanessa: I love card games! Watch out though I get very competitive
28 Dec 2013 21:51 - Sam Roberts: We could do with some Stuff actually, anyone know someone?
28 Dec 2013 21:51 - Owen: Poundland does haribo...
28 Dec 2013 21:52 - Sam Roberts: Also heaps of booze. We ran out last time after buying enough for the chinese army
28 Dec 2013 22:25 - Cate: I can't get any Stuff. Bunn bring cards against humanity!! Did you get the expansion pack yet?
28 Dec 2013 22:26 - Bunn: Yeah i'll def bring it!
28 Dec 2013 22:27 - Bunn: No expansion pack yet but could order off amazon maybe
28 Dec 2013 22:27 - Bunn: Need to start asking around for md
28 Dec 2013 22:28 - Bunn: Do we need to worry/make preparations for the storm thats coming in?
28 Dec 2013 22:35 - Dave Mendes da Costa: I'll bring ropes for tying down the house. What would you do without me?
28 Dec 2013 22:39 - Tegan: Is Shaggy at all enlightened?
28 Dec 2013 22:39 - Sam Roberts: I'd panic dave. Panic and lose my house
28 Dec 2013 22:52 - Vanessa: Storm? Again?
28 Dec 2013 22:53 - Bunn: Appaz. Although i havnt seen any news or weather and im going on rumours
28 Dec 2013 22:54 - Vanessa: Appaz? Is that the name of it?
28 Dec 2013 22:57 - Bunn: Lol. I meant apparently but i shortened it cos im totes amaze
28 Dec 2013 23:03 - Tegan: Might bugger up the trains
28 Dec 2013 23:03 - Tegan: Sorry, bug up the trs
28 Dec 2013 23:29 - Sam Roberts: Bgr p th trns
28 Dec 2013 23:29 - Sam Roberts: I got that first time bunn
28 Dec 2013 23:31 - Bunn: Thats cos ur cool
28 Dec 2013 23:35 - Sam Roberts: I don't know if it's cool or if we've spent so long living together that our menstrual cycles wre in line
28 Dec 2013 23:55 - Bunn: I can believe that
28 Dec 2013 23:55 - Bunn: But according to Spaced. Men are supposed to have this unspoken understanding of how to act out a gunfight
28 Dec 2013 23:55 - Bunn: Which is a bit cooler than syncronised bleeding
29 Dec 2013 09:53 - Phil 2: If a gunfight erupts I'll use you as a human shield and then sell your remains to a cat food company.
29 Dec 2013 10:03 - Bunn: Good to know you're on my side
29 Dec 2013 10:03 - Bunn: Sneaky Austrian
29 Dec 2013 10:03 - Bunn: Aren't you supposed to go Arnie?
29 Dec 2013 10:04 - Bunn: And stand solo with a minigun in the heart of battle
29 Dec 2013 10:04 - Bunn: And destroy everything in sight?
29 Dec 2013 11:58 - Owen: Are we getting trains now? Also what colour is my name on wassap?
29 Dec 2013 13:12 - Cate: Brown. What's the closest station?
29 Dec 2013 13:15 - Owen: I don't know.  Sam said something about trains. I liked the idea of hiring a car, but then again I can't drive and mainly liked the idea of getting drunk with shaggy distracting the driver until we careered into a hedge.
29 Dec 2013 13:20 - Sam Roberts: One car and some people on trains, I think you were down for car-ing?
29 Dec 2013 13:23 - Dave Mendes da Costa: Car would be great if there are people happy to drive. Phil, are you still game? X
29 Dec 2013 13:28 - Owen: Since we can't stay on the first wouldn't it be best for everyone to go by car?
29 Dec 2013 13:47 - Cate: Owen makes a lot of sense. Also Sam, what train station would we go to?
29 Dec 2013 13:48 - Dave Mendes da Costa: Last time we went to brokenhurst broklesby
29 Dec 2013 13:49 - Cate: Seriously?!
29 Dec 2013 13:48 - Dave Mendes da Costa: Brockenhurst even
29 Dec 2013 13:49 - Cate: That place name like my name!!
29 Dec 2013 13:50 - Cate: No. No it isn't. As you were...
29 Dec 2013 13:49 - Dave Mendes da Costa: Heh, too much excitment
29 Dec 2013 13:49 - Dave Mendes da Costa: Are you training or carrying cate?
29 Dec 2013 13:50 - Dave Mendes da Costa: Urg, carring
29 Dec 2013 13:55 - Sam Roberts: Could get two cars, I'd prefer train though tbh, trains are fine on the 1st, about 2 hours to waterloo every half hour. Cars a bit cheaper, trains are nicer
29 Dec 2013 14:03 - Bunn: What was the price for two cars? Did tegan look into that last time? I can drive
29 Dec 2013 14:04 - Bunn: Also. We have accumulated two bags of unidentified clothing in our house. If you think you might own some of these items please come and pick them up before i chuck them out in a couple of weeks time
29 Dec 2013 14:23 - Dave Mendes da Costa: Marth reckoned that two cars with four in each would be around 34 quid each.
29 Dec 2013 14:23 - Dave Mendes da Costa: How many are going?
29 Dec 2013 14:33 - Sam Roberts: 13 I think, 7 seater an option?
29 Dec 2013 14:40 - Dave Mendes da Costa: Could get a couple of 7s. Marth worked it out as 46 each that way.
29 Dec 2013 14:50 - Vanessa: I'm already training it. The station in arriving at is called Lymington Town. Is that right Sam?
29 Dec 2013 14:51 - Vanessa: Bunny is there a dark red herringbone bomber jacket in there?
29 Dec 2013 15:04 - Owen: Don't we need at least one car to get us from brocksbursy leminghurst town (or whatever its called) to sam's?
29 Dec 2013 15:03 - Dave Mendes da Costa: Could taxi
29 Dec 2013 15:08 - Vanessa: I'm arriving at around 10pm so I'll figure it out when I get there
29 Dec 2013 15:20 - Sam Roberts: Probably taxi for v then, which leaves a 7 and a 5, or a 7 and 5 by train
29 Dec 2013 15:20 - Sam Roberts: Def need one car, mainly for ease / booze runs / flexibility
29 Dec 2013 15:21 - Sam Roberts: Station is lymington, or Brockenhurst. Brock is a bit further but easier trains, lymington is 1 more change
29 Dec 2013 15:22 - Sam Roberts: So depends on whether whoever's driving is up for a slightly longer pickup *lascivious wink at marth*
29 Dec 2013 15:23 - Owen: Me and eliza will do the same thing as you sam.
29 Dec 2013 15:24 - Sam Roberts: Awesome sauce, we can plan pranks to play on Bunny
29 Dec 2013 15:23 - Dave Mendes da Costa: You're walking aren't you Sam?
29 Dec 2013 15:24 - Owen: Scratch that... we will do the same thang as whoever has the keys to the house.
29 Dec 2013 15:24 - Sam Roberts: I bought a unicycle just for this!
29 Dec 2013 15:25 - Owen: Well add mine and eliza's unicycles and you will have a tricycle.  Just like a grown up little boy.
29 Dec 2013 15:28 - Shaggy: Wazzzzuuuuuuuuuuiuup
29 Dec 2013 15:29 - Sam Roberts: Sup
29 Dec 2013 15:30 - Owen: Hi shaggy.
29 Dec 2013 15:30 - Sam Roberts: So I think we should stick to the e-list
29 Dec 2013 15:30 - Owen: ??
29 Dec 2013 15:30 - Owen: Elist?
29 Dec 2013 15:30 - Sam Roberts: Car: teeg n dave, shag marth, pton and oliza
29 Dec 2013 15:31 - Sam Roberts: Leaves bunn, cate, rob, V and me by train / taxi
29 Dec 2013 15:31 - Sam Roberts: Did I miss anyone?
29 Dec 2013 15:32 - Owen: 7 peeps.
29 Dec 2013 15:32 - Owen: Sounds good.
29 Dec 2013 15:32 - Owen: If we get there early is there a pub?
29 Dec 2013 15:36 - Shaggy: There is
29 Dec 2013 15:36 - Shaggy: And I know where
29 Dec 2013 15:37 - Owen: What style of shoes do you like shaggy?
29 Dec 2013 15:37 - Shaggy: Skate shoes
29 Dec 2013 15:36 - Dave Mendes da Costa: Sounds good. I'm out of work at 1230. What time are we leaving?
29 Dec 2013 15:38 - Shaggy: I'm free all day
29 Dec 2013 15:38 - Owen: Do you like stilettos?
29 Dec 2013 15:39 - Owen: Me too
29 Dec 2013 15:39 - Shaggy: Not for myself, but yes
29 Dec 2013 15:53 - Sam Roberts: There's a good pub across the road and a great pub 5 mins drive away
29 Dec 2013 18:27 - Martha: Can't be arsed to read 153 new whatsapp messages. What's up folks?
29 Dec 2013 18:27 - Martha: Big festive love to you all from Xav & me in Brussels xx
29 Dec 2013 18:28 - Dave Mendes da Costa: There's a car crew and a train crew. These are mentioned about 10 messages ago. Can only stay until the 1st. Gonna be playing with cards. Need booze. X
29 Dec 2013 18:33 - Bunn: And drugs would be nice
29 Dec 2013 19:30 - Owen: Anyone know where to get some hallucinogens? Mushrooms or summat?
29 Dec 2013 19:34 - Dave Mendes da Costa: Tegs and I are thinking of training down if it's just gonna be one 7 seater car.
29 Dec 2013 20:51 - Bunn: Still asking around
29 Dec 2013 22:23 - Bongo: Just catching up on these messages, is everyone heading down tomorrow or tues?
29 Dec 2013 22:59 - Sam Roberts: 31st, guess that's Tuesday
29 Dec 2013 23:00 - Sam Roberts: That leaves 2 seats in the car? Also can team shagmarth be in charge of sorting that out?
29 Dec 2013 23:07 - Bongo: I guess I'll train it down with you lot in the day then.
29 Dec 2013 23:07 - Bongo: Those clothes are mine btw, I'll take them off your hands next time I'm round.
30 Dec 2013 11:58 - Shaggy: Why is there a train crew if we all have to be back at the same time? All in car makes more sense
30 Dec 2013 11:59 - Cate: I would rather go by car, is there room in a car for me? X
30 Dec 2013 11:59 - Shaggy: And it's an aweful long way to go for one night anyway. Just sayin
30 Dec 2013 12:00 - Cate: Let's go todaaay!
30 Dec 2013 12:04 - Bunn: Just come here Cate if you're bored today
30 Dec 2013 12:11 - Bunn: Its miserable outside today :(
30 Dec 2013 12:18 - Vanessa: Perfect day for hot choco and baileys
30 Dec 2013 12:18 - Dave Mendes da Costa: At work :(
30 Dec 2013 12:42 - Bunn: Gonna throw this (potentially) controversial suggestion out there
30 Dec 2013 12:42 - Bunn: NYE at Croydon Road?
30 Dec 2013 12:44 - Sam Roberts: I'm easy,  anywhere with all you beautiful people and some tunes is good for me
30 Dec 2013 12:45 - Sam Roberts: Ideally some naughty salts as well, anyone got some thoughts on that
30 Dec 2013 12:45 - Sam Roberts: ?
30 Dec 2013 12:47 - Dave Mendes da Costa: I guess that it is a bit of a mission if we're off the next day. Would have been great to see the sea though.
30 Dec 2013 12:49 - Shaggy: In this weather you might as well squint your eyes and look at the ripples on the puddles in our garden
30 Dec 2013 12:49 - Dave Mendes da Costa: Heh, perhaps I can take a trip out on your garden boat.
30 Dec 2013 12:50 - Tegan: Point taken- it's not really the weather for a walk.  Let's visit the sea in the spring time.
30 Dec 2013 12:50 - Sam Roberts: You'll have to fight the foxes first
30 Dec 2013 12:52 - Sam Roberts: Thinking about food and people, phil / marth, you know some roast stuff we can have cold? Like, do a ham in the morning maybe?
30 Dec 2013 12:52 - Sam Roberts: And can you do veggies for the veggies dave?
30 Dec 2013 12:52 - Dave Mendes da Costa: Roast red peppers are great cold
30 Dec 2013 12:53 - Bunn: Ok this seems to be gathering momentum. Lets see what everyone else says. What would have been spent on travel can be spent on more food
30 Dec 2013 12:54 - Bunn: Vanessa will be reimbursed cos she's already bought a train ticket
30 Dec 2013 12:55 - Vanessa: I've also got a bottle of vodka and rum ready to be cracked open!
30 Dec 2013 12:55 - Sam Roberts: I feel pretty good about this actually, bantsmas was awesome
30 Dec 2013 12:55 - Dave Mendes da Costa: Agreed, though she should try and get a refund if possible.
30 Dec 2013 13:09 - Vanessa: It wasn't a lot so don't worry about it
30 Dec 2013 13:09 - Dave Mendes da Costa: I'm happy to chip in V. Also very happy to help with food.
30 Dec 2013 13:10 - Vanessa: Teaches me a lesson for being too organised
30 Dec 2013 13:13 - Cate: :/
30 Dec 2013 13:15 - Shaggy: Not sure it's one of those things in life that you need a lesson for, but yes, your fault
30 Dec 2013 13:16 - Vanessa: Thanks mom
30 Dec 2013 13:15 - Dave Mendes da Costa: Is anyone not up for relocation to c town?
30 Dec 2013 13:35 - Eliza Bott: Owen and I are fine either way.
30 Dec 2013 16:06 - Martha: Damn, seriously? I agree, a lot cheaper, but cottage last year was sooooo epic
30 Dec 2013 16:08 - Sam Roberts: Agreed but I'd say cos of the people, not the place
30 Dec 2013 16:17 - Martha: 7 reasons why: (1) disco room, separated with a curtain from (2) awesome chill out room with more sofas than a room ever needs pushed into a circle, with (3) disco lights. (4) a kitchen with a table we sit and play cards around and eat around that's not covered with crap. (5) a garden to chill out in intermittently throughout the evening, where we're less likely to get stabbed, and (6) a clean, comfy bed with fresh sheets to lay your head on when the sun is rising and your body is blissfully fragile. And (7) the coast of England to enjoy with close friends and a glass of orange juice on New Year's Day. Yay?
30 Dec 2013 16:23 - Cate: Yay!
30 Dec 2013 16:25 - Tegan: Awww, Marth, you're such a poet! I'm easy either way x
30 Dec 2013 16:29 - Bunn: <Media omitted>
30 Dec 2013 16:29 - Bunn: Our table is NOT covered in crap
30 Dec 2013 16:30 - Bunn: (I cleaned. I took offence to that one)
30 Dec 2013 16:32 - Sam Roberts: (Bunn cleaned. He took offence to that one)
30 Dec 2013 16:34 - Bunn: We could substitute new years day walk by the sea with something in london together?
30 Dec 2013 16:55 - Tegan: Do you guys really not fancy it?
30 Dec 2013 16:59 - Sam Roberts: I'm getting way more into the idea of c-town by the minute!
30 Dec 2013 17:00 - Sam Roberts: We've got twice the people as last year, and we'll have the place all nice for you ladies
30 Dec 2013 17:00 - Dave Mendes da Costa: Fancy a hand getting it ready tonight? Perhaps in testing the sofa out.
30 Dec 2013 17:03 - Sam Roberts: Hehe in my experience that rarely ends in the place getting tidier!
30 Dec 2013 17:03 - Dave Mendes da Costa: You can trust me...
30 Dec 2013 17:04 - Sam Roberts: Sofa's free and waiting for you if you're around though
30 Dec 2013 17:04 - Dave Mendes da Costa: Woot. There's a plan to meet Chris Alford tonight if anyone's up for that. X
30 Dec 2013 17:06 - Bunn: Yeah i am. But whats the plan? All iv heard is flimsyness
30 Dec 2013 17:08 - Dave Mendes da Costa: Sounds like a rerun of the last brick lane night. Any better suggestions?
30 Dec 2013 17:11 - Sam Roberts: Partying? Blurgh! I intend to drink some fine scotch and play some games, sleep well and get cracking for tomorrow
30 Dec 2013 17:15 - Tegan: Better suggestions please- on the facebook page If possible,  to keep Chris in the loop
30 Dec 2013 17:31 - Bunn: Cool
30 Dec 2013 17:47 - Dave Mendes da Costa: Sounds like the plan is to meet at the big chill in kings cross.
30 Dec 2013 17:49 - Cate: Can I come? What's the details? X
30 Dec 2013 17:50 - Bunn: 7 o clock kings cross
30 Dec 2013 17:49 - Dave Mendes da Costa: Hell yeah Cate! I'm heading to the big chill bar near king cross now. Others should be around from 7. X

6 Jan 18:45 - Dave Mendes da Costa: Do they have a veggie burger?
6 Jan 19:18 - Sam Roberts: I think they have one made out of vegetarians, any good?
6 Jan 19:24 - Tegan: Mmmmmmm.... grilled cheese sandwich...
6 Jan 19:26 - Sam Roberts: I have done some research, they have a veggie option where you get the bun and all the veg you can fit in it, like grilled shrooms and onions, which are done on a separate veg grill
6 Jan 21:27 - Vanessa: Oh yum the veggie option sounds really good. I might have to have it after my meat
7 Jan 09:53 - Sam Roberts: Anyone for a cine-trip tomorrow? I'd like to see the new ben stiller thing
7 Jan 09:53 - Shaggy: Maybe, haven't been to a picture theatre in quite a while
7 Jan 09:56 - Martha: Meh. I've got a dinner with a friend visiting tomorrow, so will have to give it a miss this time. I really fancy seeing american hustle - next week?
7 Jan 10:00 - Vanessa: No can do for me either this week
7 Jan 10:25 - Bunn: Apparently american hustle is really bad
7 Jan 10:26 - Shaggy: Apparently Jennifer Lawrence looks boday in American hustle
7 Jan 10:26 - Martha: Damn, until now I had only heard good things.
7 Jan 10:26 - Martha: Bunn, why you gotta rain on ma parade? Grr
7 Jan 10:27 - Shaggy: Again
7 Jan 10:27 - Martha: Indeed, again.
7 Jan 10:27 - Bunn: Im trying to save you! Iv only heard bad things. Not one good review
7 Jan 10:29 - Bunn: Probably wrong tho...
7 Jan 10:34 - Bunn: But mostly its cos i like to ruin things
7 Jan 11:03 - Owen: Rotten tomatoes has American hustle at 95%. So it can't be all bad. Me and liza were thinking of seeing it.
7 Jan 11:05 - Shaggy: I don't rate rotten tomatoes
7 Jan 11:06 - Owen: Really why? It seems pretty accurate to me. And has a simple easy to understand algorithm.
7 Jan 11:21 - Eliza Bott: I'm up for seeing it Marth, despite all this rain.
7 Jan 11:22 - Eliza Bott: Unless there's actual rain... in which case I'll probably stay in...
7 Jan 11:23 - Martha: Yay! Unfortunately I can't tomorrow though, was thinking maybe pnext week orange wed?
7 Jan 11:24 - Eliza Bott: Next week is good.
7 Jan 11:47 - Shaggy: Rotten tomatoes seems to consistently disagree with me, or at least it used to and now I never use it. Or any ratings site, word of mouth is best for this sort of thing, bar only to own impressions
7 Jan 12:47 - Phil 2: Name one thing that does not consistently disagree with you.
7 Jan 12:49 - Bongo: Beer
7 Jan 12:51 - Shaggy: Word
7 Jan 12:56 - Hannah: <Media omitted>
7 Jan 13:12 - Bunn: <Media omitted>
7 Jan 13:28 - Phil 2: Brontosaurus mance.
7 Jan 14:07 - Owen: Perhaps you just have terrible taste in films shaggy. Also if it consistently disagrees with you then it is an excellent system, you just need to do the opposite of what it says.
7 Jan 14:54 - Shaggy: It's not excellent, it's terrible, just like bbc weather. If I have to change my mindset just so that one system works as well as others, it's a failure as a product
7 Jan 15:08 - Owen: Can you give me examples of where it is wrong?
7 Jan 15:09 - Shaggy: Like I said I haven't used it since its conception
7 Jan 15:09 - Owen: So you have no idea if it is good or bad then?
7 Jan 15:09 - Bunn: <Media omitted>
7 Jan 15:10 - Owen: I generally find it pretty excellent
7 Jan 15:10 - Bunn: <Media omitted>
7 Jan 15:10 - Shaggy: I know it was bad
7 Jan 15:11 - Shaggy: And everyone knows rotten tomatoes don't get any better
7 Jan 15:12 - Owen: I think you may be confusing the website with the fruit.
7 Jan 15:56 - Sam Roberts: Science time! Give us 3 films you really like, and 3 you really don't.  Newer films would be better, and no cheating!
7 Jan 16:04 - Shaggy: I had a browse already: rush was a great film, 89 is perhaps overrated but I'll let it slide. Snatch is 73 which I think is too low, it's certainly a million times better than rush, but perhaps it's an old film. Pitch black, that came out same time as snatch, is 57 and a failure? Well that's bullshit, it's an excellent film. I know exactly the soppy heart wrenching and gut warming films they would rate highly and it's not at all aligned to my tastes
7 Jan 16:15 - Bunn: Eurgh. Shaddap already. This is not bants
7 Jan 16:15 - Sam Roberts: That's bad testing! It means nothing if you do it blind, you're basically saying you found 3 films you kind of agree with
7 Jan 16:16 - Bunn: No1 cares about your moanig shaggy
7 Jan 16:16 - Bunn: Moaning*
7 Jan 16:18 - Owen: Also 57% is very close to fresh. The only problem I have with rotten tomatoes is the binary nature of fresh/rotten.  If you just go by percentage instead it is more accurate.
7 Jan 16:18 - Sam Roberts: Pitch black was a solid 57, enjoyable but not particularly great
7 Jan 16:18 - Shaggy: No one cares about *your* moaning bunn
7 Jan 16:19 - Owen: Better than crap. Not as good as great.
7 Jan 16:20 - Shaggy: That's not at all what I said Sam
7 Jan 16:20 - Sam Roberts: I care bunn. Without booze I need all the pointless arguments I can get!
7 Jan 16:20 - Shaggy: If it's consistent it doesn't matter if it's blind or not
7 Jan 16:20 - Bunn: Your stupid arguing is ruining whatsapp
7 Jan 16:20 - Sam Roberts: Yeah but you automatically pick the ones that aren't
7 Jan 16:21 - Bunn: <Media omitted>
7 Jan 16:21 - Bunn: See? Thats funny. Thats what whatsapp is for
7 Jan 16:21 - Bunn: The pub is for arguing
7 Jan 16:22 - Shaggy: No because that would assume I have knowledge of what is and isn't, and I don't. I picked a film I watched recently, a film I know is excellent and a film I know I would enjoy
7 Jan 16:22 - Bunn: #dryjanuarysucks
7 Jan 16:22 - Dave Mendes da Costa: Agreed
7 Jan 16:23 - Bunn: Thanks dave
7 Jan 16:23 - Shaggy: Based on rt I don't know if I wouldn't enjoy a film or some arsehole wouldn't enjoy a film. Moreover I don't know if a film is good so that I would enjoy it or good so it gets loads of nominations and I dot give a shit about
7 Jan 16:24 - Shaggy: #boredatwork
7 Jan 16:24 - Sam Roberts: Hah maybe we should make our own whatsapp, with black boxes and hookers
7 Jan 16:25 - Bunn: Blackjack*
7 Jan 16:26 - Vanessa: Who's coming to burger night tonight?
7 Jan 16:27 - Shaggy: I am, as soon as I can get out of this godforsaken office
7 Jan 16:27 - Shaggy: I'm on edge, I think I'm getting beer withdrawal symptoms
7 Jan 16:27 - Sam Roberts: I'm there
7 Jan 16:27 - Bunn: Yeah i'm keen for burger club. What time?
7 Jan 16:29 - Vanessa: 7:30 at Angel
7 Jan 16:46 - Bunn: No probs :)
7 Jan 16:49 - Sam Roberts: I'm so hungry, tempted to go for a pre-burger burger to take the edge off
7 Jan 16:50 - Martha: 7:30, I'm in!
7 Jan 16:50 - Vanessa: Sweet!
7 Jan 16:50 - Shaggy: Yeah or a pre-milkshake
7 Jan 16:51 - Vanessa: Yeah a pre-milkshake is a better idea
7 Jan 16:52 - Tegan: I'm out- poisoned by Wetherspoons last night :( - I was looking forward to that sandwich. ..
7 Jan 16:55 - Shaggy: Your high class stomach can't take whetherspoons grub anymore
7 Jan 17:11 - Sam Roberts: I hate getting better taste, I can't handle mcdonalds anymore, I've got to schlep all the way to kfc!
7 Jan 17:36 - Shaggy: Looks who's too good for Dallas chicken all of a sudden
7 Jan 18:31 - Bongo: They really went downhill since I left.
7 Jan 18:32 - Bunn: Still good tho. In a disgusting fast food way
7 Jan 18:39 - Sam Roberts: Greatest meal of all time,  maximun once a week
7 Jan 18:40 - Sam Roberts: Just got here, I'm having a pre-pre-burger milkshake coke in the Nags Head, opposite angel station and a little down
7 Jan 18:52 - Bunn: Leaving work in 10
7 Jan 18:59 - Bongo: I'll be there in 20
7 Jan 19:00 - Shaggy: Do you mean up and do you mean hogs head?
7 Jan 19:03 - Sam Roberts: Depends which way your facing and no
7 Jan 19:04 - Sam Roberts: I'm the one in the window with an orange and lemonade and disappointed expression
7 Jan 19:04 - Vanessa: I'm just leaving work. Should I meet y'all at Five Guys?
7 Jan 19:14 - Sam Roberts: Yeah game on, we'll head there
7 Jan 19:20 - Shaggy: We're here, waitin on all y'all
7 Jan 19:23 - Bunn: Im here
7 Jan 19:24 - Shaggy: I know! You're sitting opposite me
7 Jan 19:31 - Martha: On my way! X
7 Jan 19:33 - Phil 2: Send  pix of the steamed hams.
7 Jan 19:42 - Shaggy: <Media omitted>
7 Jan 19:42 - Dave Mendes da Costa: Arse?
7 Jan 19:44 - Owen: Shaggy how is your bum hairier than your face?
7 Jan 19:45 - Bunn: Steamy
7 Jan 20:34 - Hannah: Anyone want to join me on the 30 day squat challenge
7 Jan 20:35 - Hannah: <Media omitted>
7 Jan 20:35 - Shaggy: How many squatters you can rat on in a month?
7 Jan 20:46 - Dave Mendes da Costa: I can't believe it starts with 50
7 Jan 20:55 - Shaggy: Man I want a bum like that
7 Jan 20:58 - Owen: Less hairy?
7 Jan 20:58 - Shaggy: That was bunn's for the record
7 Jan 21:01 - Owen: That explains a lot.  It also raises many questions.
7 Jan 21:18 - Sam Roberts: I'm in hannah, can't let my buns get like bunns!
7 Jan 21:18 - Sam Roberts: You starting today?
7 Jan 21:36 - Vanessa: Good luck on your squats. I'll begin organising the next burger Tuesday #priorities
7 Jan 21:39 - Bunn: You'd all kill for a firm buttocks like mine
7 Jan 21:40 - Bunn: #bunnsbuns
7 Jan 21:42 - Shaggy: I will kill you and wear your buns on my head
7 Jan 21:43 - Shaggy: <Media omitted>
7 Jan 21:43 - Bunn: <Media omitted>
8 Jan 09:55 - Shaggy: Anyone seen gravity?
8 Jan 09:56 - Bunn: Yeah its awesome. Def worth seeing in 3d and cinema. cant imagine the same experience downloading it
8 Jan 10:19 - Shaggy: I don't believe you. It got 97 on rottentomatoes
8 Jan 10:20 - Hannah: Tbh I heard it was awful
8 Jan 10:45 - Sam Roberts: Awwww yeah rottentomatoes chat again!
8 Jan 10:45 - Bunn: Yeah not exactly shakespear but visually stunning
8 Jan 10:59 - Shaggy: So have it as a backdrop for bonobo discography basically
8 Jan 11:05 - Owen: Tbh gravity needed more lizard men.
8 Jan 11:24 - Shaggy: When's the next #burgur? #want
8 Jan 11:32 - Shaggy: Since nessi is hating on Shake shack I propose we go another day without her
8 Jan 11:55 - Sam Roberts: I'll go on a burger date with you,  but I'll be thinking of Ness
8 Jan 11:55 - Shaggy: As long as you don't call out her name it's all good
8 Jan 11:55 - Sam Roberts: Where is shake shack? Would be cool to find a good place nearer us, something in london bridge?
8 Jan 12:01 - Bunn: Not many people make new years resolutions to eat more burgers
8 Jan 12:01 - Shaggy: Covent Arden
8 Jan 12:02 - Shaggy: Today's shake of the day: malted marshmallow milk chocolate
8 Jan 12:18 - Shaggy: Shake shack menu includes dog snacks #waht
8 Jan 12:26 - Sam Roberts: For when you have 100 problems
8 Jan 12:37 - Shaggy: Lol
8 Jan 12:58 - Vanessa: (Gasp) Sam I can't believe you would cheat on me and right in front of me
8 Jan 13:01 - Sam Roberts: I thought it was you honey I swear! His whatsapp colour is almost identical!
8 Jan 13:24 - Bunn: Ooooo
8 Jan 13:24 - Bunn: Everyone can see through your lies Sam
8 Jan 13:24 - Bunn: Jerry! Jerry! Jerry! Jerry!
8 Jan 13:33 - Bunn: I like the sound of malted marshmallow milkshake.
8 Jan 13:33 - Bunn: Where did you say that did the oreo milkshake?
8 Jan 13:39 - Sam Roberts: Anything fun happening this evening? Maybe a wahaca /film combo?
8 Jan 13:42 - Bunn: I think i gotta work late so i'm out
8 Jan 13:43 - Dave Mendes da Costa: Would that be at the wharf?
8 Jan 13:45 - Dave Mendes da Costa: Pop quiz: how tall is the shard? No cheating!
8 Jan 14:01 - Owen: I would guess about 580m
8 Jan 14:01 - Owen: Wow, I was way off :(
8 Jan 14:02 - Dave Mendes da Costa: Harp. I have no sense of height eiyher
8 Jan 14:03 - Owen: I was thinking about it compared to the birj kalifa in dubai. I assumed that the shard would be over half its height easily. Nope!
8 Jan 14:05 - Mike Prime: Back on Whatsapp!
8 Jan 14:05 - Mike Prime: 540 new messages from the Horde
8 Jan 14:05 - Phil 2: Shard is about 250m I think.
8 Jan 14:05 - Dave Mendes da Costa: ...and that's why I hate mike
8 Jan 14:07 - Bunn: Yeah i recon 200m ish
8 Jan 14:08 - Owen: You are also both way off.
8 Jan 14:08 - Mike Prime: Wow I'm glad I made it back for this riveting convo
8 Jan 14:08 - Owen: Phil has been closest so far.
8 Jan 14:09 - Bunn: Dave's stupid quiz
8 Jan 14:09 - Phil 2: Anti Semite
8 Jan 14:17 - Dave Mendes da Costa: Apologies, bored at lunch.
8 Jan 14:17 - Martha: 268
8 Jan 14:17 - Martha: Give us more.
8 Jan 14:18 - Martha: What colour is Sam's top today?
8 Jan 14:18 - Martha: What colour is Tegan's right sock?
8 Jan 14:19 - Martha: How much does Martha wish she were still on holiday?
8 Jan 14:41 - Sam Roberts: Salmon pink, some kind of fuchsia, 11/10
8 Jan 14:53 - Tegan: Hint: in a break from routine, it's the same colour as my left sock
8 Jan 15:02 - Martha: (1)Blue with a delicate pattern of smudges (2)green? And (3) shoot me now
8 Jan 15:04 - Bunn: How many times have i thought about burgers today?
8 Jan 15:06 - Dave Mendes da Costa: Burgcoup
8 Jan 15:19 - Sam Roberts: Not far off marty!
8 Jan 15:20 - Sam Roberts: Yo mike, no one seems up for wahacing tonight, dallas and film at ours?
8 Jan 15:31 - Mike Prime: I have finally caught up on this thread, here are my thoughts:
8 Jan 15:32 - Mike Prime: Metacritic is way way better than rotten tomatoes and american hustle is supposed to be amazing
8 Jan 15:32 - Mike Prime: I think boringjanuary is getting to you guys
8 Jan 15:33 - Mike Prime: What the hell was that ass thing all about?
8 Jan 15:46 - Phil 2: We refer to bunn's hairy rump as steamed ham. Way to slum this highbrow convo up Mikado.
8 Jan 16:00 - Mike Prime: It's clearly grilled
8 Jan 16:00 - Bunn: <Media omitted>
8 Jan 16:01 - Bunn: Its from a little game called bum or elbow
8 Jan 16:01 - Bunn: House bants material
8 Jan 16:01 - Bunn: Until shaggy shared
8 Jan 16:06 - Phil 2: Elbow
8 Jan 16:10 - Dave Mendes da Costa: Agreed
8 Jan 16:19 - Shaggy: You started by posting duckface here
8 Jan 16:21 - Bunn: I'm sorry i shared your vagina with everyone
8 Jan 16:22 - Shaggy: It's was for your eyes only!!!
8 Jan 16:22 - Shaggy: It's only fair I shared your sexual organ too
8 Jan 16:22 - Bunn: Haha
8 Jan 17:20 - Tegan: Can we join you for the movie? Might pass on the take away, I'm on a cream cracker diet
8 Jan 17:21 - Mike Prime: I'm still on for movie
8 Jan 17:30 - Tegan: Are you talking cinema or home times?
8 Jan 17:31 - Mike Prime: Ah I thought you were talking cinema, were you not?
8 Jan 17:37 - Tegan: Depends on the Dave,  he's a little under the weather. .. Will report back
8 Jan 17:50 - Sam Roberts: I'm in for either! Quick choice though, I'll be cycling somewhere in 15 minutes
8 Jan 17:54 - Tegan: Radio silence from Dave. We also need to factor the laundrette into our plans... Yours?
8 Jan 17:55 - Shaggy: I vote home
8 Jan 17:55 - Mike Prime: Yeah come ours then. Does anyone wana see that 12 years a slave film when it comes out? Looks awesome
8 Jan 17:57 - Tegan: It's going to be harsh... But yes.
8 Jan 18:20 - Bunn: Only god forgives?
8 Jan 18:23 - Sam Roberts: You seen silver linings playbook? I vote that for tonight. Same director as American hustle
8 Jan 18:35 - Bunn: Sounds bon
8 Jan 18:35 - Bunn: Gotta wait for a late night work thing to finish. Dont wait up
8 Jan 18:59 - Dave Mendes da Costa: Silver linings playbook sounds good.
8 Jan 19:00 - Dave Mendes da Costa: And the shard is 310m.
8 Jan 19:01 - Mike Prime: Seen it. Don't mind watching again though
9 Jan 09:27 - Vanessa: <Media omitted>
9 Jan 09:29 - Phil 2: Not bad. Keep at it and one day you'll be writing beautiful stories about rainbow unicorn princesses.
9 Jan 09:30 - Owen: To be fair. The question is ambiguous and the pupil has given a correct answer given the ambiguity.
9 Jan 09:39 - Bunn: How much detention would you give them owen?
9 Jan 09:59 - Owen: Zero. Because that answer is awesome!
9 Jan 10:13 - Eliza Bott: But how many thank you cards would you make him write?
9 Jan 10:27 - Martha: So apparently (according to Bunn) American hustle IS the shit. We'll see it next week. Sorted.
9 Jan 10:28 - Eliza Bott: Excellent. Wednesday?
9 Jan 10:43 - Sam Roberts: Agree, just had a chat with office chap who was raving about it. I loved silver lining playbook last night as well!
9 Jan 10:43 - Bunn: Yeah it was good!
9 Jan 10:57 - Mike Prime: When did you see it?
9 Jan 10:58 - Bunn: Nah someone from work said it was good
9 Jan 10:59 - Mike Prime: Also American Hustle by David O Russell is a rhyme
9 Jan 11:00 - Mike Prime: You can't argue with that
9 Jan 12:26 - Shaggy: Technically not quite
9 Jan 12:36 - Bunn: Really argumentative during dry january arent ya?
9 Jan 12:40 - Sam Roberts: That's totally not true bunn, and I resent you saying it
9 Jan 12:41 - Mike Prime: <Media omitted>
9 Jan 12:42 - Mike Prime: Graph of how argumentative shaggy is vs the amount of alcohol he's drunk recently
9 Jan 13:05 - Bunn: Math banths
9 Jan 15:07 - Vanessa: Woot woot I'm not working this weekend! Who wants to go to brunch?
9 Jan 15:07 - Shaggy: Shakeshack?
9 Jan 15:08 - Vanessa: üòï
9 Jan 15:09 - Vanessa: If you want we can do shakeshack for burger Tuesday
9 Jan 15:52 - Phil 2: Can we do either breakfast or lunch? Brunch is a fabrication of the gay agenda.
9 Jan 15:56 - Shaggy: Brunch is a true English approach to food
9 Jan 15:59 - Sam Roberts: Where else can you get bacon, egg and potato dauphinoise on one plate?
9 Jan 16:00 - Bunn: Breakfast then second breakfast
9 Jan 16:00 - Bunn: Hobbit styke
9 Jan 16:01 - Bunn: Style*
9 Jan 16:01 - Bunn: .... Then brunch
9 Jan 16:01 - Shaggy: Then secon brunch
9 Jan 16:01 - Bunn: .... Then lunch?
9 Jan 16:01 - Shaggy: Followed by afternoon tea
9 Jan 16:07 - Bunn: With cake
9 Jan 16:07 - Bunn: Then supper
9 Jan 16:07 - Owen: Jesus christ guys how could you leave out elevenses.
9 Jan 16:08 - Bunn: Where does elevenses fit in?
9 Jan 16:08 - Hannah: Are we talking Saturday or Sunday?
9 Jan 16:09 - Owen: Between brunch and half-lunch.
9 Jan 16:09 - Vanessa: Either
9 Jan 16:13 - Sam Roberts: Both. Elevenses is for everyday
9 Jan 16:15 - Vanessa: I was answering Hannah's question
9 Jan 16:16 - Owen: But hannah asked a serious question. You don't answer those V.
9 Jan 16:19 - Eliza Bott: Owen's right. This is the place for dumb jokes and arguments about personal taste. Not sorting things out.
9 Jan 16:21 - Owen: Thank you for supporting me in my decision to be an idiot dear wife.
9 Jan 16:41 - Bunn: Haha
9 Jan 16:42 - Bunn: And dumb pictures
9 Jan 16:42 - Bunn: <Media omitted>
9 Jan 16:45 - Owen: I like how the cat has a mousetash
9 Jan 16:45 - Owen: Hehe mouse tash
9 Jan 16:46 - Owen: Because he's a cat.
9 Jan 16:46 - Owen: And cats like mice.
9 Jan 16:46 - Owen: Get it?
9 Jan 16:46 - Owen: Mouse tash
9 Jan 17:02 - Shaggy: It's a cat, it's not funny
9 Jan 17:03 - Bunn: Has a better tash than you shaggy
9 Jan 17:03 - Shaggy: That hurt, Bunn. That hurt
9 Jan 17:03 - Shaggy: At least my facial hair isn't ginger
9 Jan 17:06 - Bunn: Haha
9 Jan 17:06 - Bunn: Low blows all round!
9 Jan 17:41 - Sam Roberts: After bunn shaves the sink looks like someone put a banger in an orange
10 Jan 13:28 - Martha: CATS
10 Jan 13:28 - Martha: (I may or may not have just noticed the group profile pic)
10 Jan 13:50 - Shaggy: Such is the horde
10 Jan 13:53 - Mike Prime: Just looked it up - one of the collective nouns for cats is 'pounce'
10 Jan 14:14 - Shaggy: Horde is a collective noun for the lovable degenerates I have gathered here
10 Jan 18:15 - Shaggy: <Media omitted>
10 Jan 18:18 - Tegan: Beautiful!
10 Jan 18:24 - Bongo: Woa who painted those?
10 Jan 18:25 - Vanessa: That is so cute
10 Jan 18:26 - Shaggy: Vinay
10 Jan 18:28 - Bongo: He's just gone up 3 points in my book.
10 Jan 18:33 - Tegan: His Hobbes is especially awesome
10 Jan 18:34 - Tegan: I can't not say this. .. In case anyone was wondering, business class is the bomb! Sorry dry January,  this champagne is free! FREE!
10 Jan 18:36 - Bongo: Lol the first one to crack
10 Jan 18:36 - Tegan: Sorry guys
10 Jan 18:36 - Tegan: I reckon if also be the first to go in a horror film situation
10 Jan 18:37 - Tegan: So it's only fitting
10 Jan 18:38 - Dave Mendes da Costa: I guess the legroom won't make much of an impression on you so it's only right to enjoy the drinks. X
10 Jan 18:39 - Tegan: It's a blip. Not a slide down an icy January slope. Into a pit of beer.
10 Jan 18:40 - Dave Mendes da Costa: Drool.
10 Jan 18:51 - Shaggy: I thought you appreciated the plant pots, Tegan. You're just drunk!
10 Jan 18:51 - Tegan: Emphatically both
10 Jan 18:52 - Dave Mendes da Costa: Do you get better food?
10 Jan 18:52 - Tegan: (It was only a small glass of champagne)
10 Jan 18:52 - Tegan: I get a frickin menu
10 Jan 18:52 - Tegan: But its probably the same food
10 Jan 18:52 - Dave Mendes da Costa: Don't eat the fish
10 Jan 18:53 - Vanessa: Where are you flying to Tegs?
10 Jan 18:54 - Tegan: You know me so well! But I have avoided that temptation x
10 Jan 18:54 - Tegan: To Nairobi, for business and pleasure :)
10 Jan 18:58 - Mike Prime: Kenya believe it
10 Jan 18:59 - Mike Prime: Well there goes pun-free january
10 Jan 19:00 - Vanessa: Nice
10 Jan 19:22 - Vanessa: http://m.huhmagazine.co.uk/6064/the-simpsons-lego-set
10 Jan 19:22 - Vanessa: A new LEGO set
10 Jan 19:46 - Bongo: There's something not quite Lego about that.

12 Jan 17:07 - Mike Prime: Cold as balls in London
12 Jan 19:02 - Tegan: Och, it's actually perfect. I'm sitting out having dinner in shorts.

13 Jan 00:06 - Dave Mendes da Costa: This is under the bridge by my boat on Saturday. Thought I'd share cause it looked awesome. X
13 Jan 00:07 - Dave Mendes da Costa: It also looks like a crazy warrior if you turn it clockwise 90 degrees
13 Jan 00:11 - Vanessa: Wow that's an awesome image!
13 Jan 19:44 - Bongo: Agree, you should make that into a poster.
13 Jan 21:27 - Hannah: Album cover
13 Jan 23:02 - Sam Roberts: I'm going to have to kick y'all off Netflix, I can never use it at the mo! There's an option to upgrade from 2 to 4 users if anyone wants to chip in instead, ¬£4 a month
13 Jan 23:03 - Shaggy: Not on it, I'm game for sharing it though
13 Jan 23:03 - Shaggy: Have they rolled out the new model then?
13 Jan 23:04 - Bunn: Not on it either. Didnt you change the pword recently?
13 Jan 23:05 - Sam Roberts: Yeah, been a week or so, probably when it was bugging that time
13 Jan 23:05 - Sam Roberts: Yeah changed, then gave it all out again. I thought you could kick everyone when you feel like it, doesn't seem to work though
13 Jan 23:07 - Dave Mendes da Costa: We're out downstairs
13 Jan 23:07 - Sam Roberts: Np for now, I've got a stream, for next time though
13 Jan 23:30 - Bongo: I was on it just now.

13 Jan 23:31 - Sam Roberts: Yeah, as of a couple of weeks ago
13 Jan 23:31 - Sam Roberts: ¬£4 a month extra gets you 2 more
13 Jan 23:32 - Bongo: I'm game for that, I'll set up a direct debit with you tomorrow.
13 Jan 23:33 - Sam Roberts: Nice one. Let the semi legal streaming continue!
13 Jan 23:33 - Sam Roberts: 4 should mean everyone can use whenever
13 Jan 23:33 - Bongo: I haven't had any problems with it so far.
13 Jan 23:35 - Bunn: I havnt been able to login a few times in ctown

14 Jan 10:55 - Shaggy: Right on
14 Jan 11:08 - Tegan: Yummers
14 Jan 11:38 - Mike Prime: 2.5 hour meeting. Still going strong. Urge to kill rising.
14 Jan 11:38 - Shaggy: You have any sleep bolts left?
14 Jan 11:41 - Mike Prime: Haha
14 Jan 11:41 - Mike Prime: Gona blink out of this shit
14 Jan 13:59 - Bunn: Dont think im coming to burgers tonight

14 Jan 14:02 - Shaggy: I just had a whole pizza üçïüçïüçïüçïüçïüçïüçïüçï
14 Jan 14:07 - Bunn: Nah. More a financial decision. Hadnt budgeted to pay for a trip to budapest so impulsively
14 Jan 14:42 - Phil 2: Yo Dave you should take your boat across this thing
14 Jan 14:42 - Phil 2: <Media omitted>
14 Jan 14:44 - Dave Mendes da Costa: Ah, the unpronounceable aqueduct in Wales! I'd love to, its a proper dream. Might have to take a few weeks off work for that. Mmmm
14 Jan 15:03 - Phil 2: I think it's pronounced llllllllllllllllllllthllllllllll.
14 Jan 17:10 - Owen: You forgt the "yyyllchyy"
14 Jan 18:11 - Shaggy: So are we meeting in the lucky chip at 7:30?
14 Jan 18:13 - Sam Roberts: Yeah! Or maybe a bit before, what time're you free?
14 Jan 18:14 - Shaggy: I can leave in 15, will be there for 7 I guess
14 Jan 18:15 - Sam Roberts: Cool, I'll aim for the same
14 Jan 18:21 - Dave Mendes da Costa: See you there. Where is it? X
14 Jan 18:22 - Shaggy: Google lucky chip hoxton
14 Jan 18:26 - Vanessa: I won't make it before 7:30
14 Jan 18:27 - Shaggy: Going to pop into tk maxx, need more pjs
14 Jan 18:32 - Sam Roberts: That's not a bad shout, is there one around here?
14 Jan 18:35 - Hannah: Guys would you rather have teeth for pubes or pubes for teeth?
14 Jan 18:36 - Tegan: Teeth for pubes.  Otherwise you'd have to develop a whale-like method of eating which would be awkward at dinner parties.
14 Jan 18:36 - Dave Mendes da Costa: Teeth for pubes
14 Jan 18:36 - Dave Mendes da Costa: For reasons stated
14 Jan 18:36 - Tegan: Good question Hannah. Touching on deep and important issues.
14 Jan 18:37 - Shaggy: Bank
14 Jan 18:37 - Shaggy: Or rather monument
14 Jan 18:38 - Shaggy: What kind of teeth? Molars would be ok
14 Jan 18:39 - Sam Roberts: Ah yeah
14 Jan 18:40 - Tegan: Are they set in, so that pube maintenance would literally be pulling teeth? I sort of imagined then jangling about
14 Jan 18:40 - Shaggy: Terrible selection, it's like they don't care about peoples home comfort
14 Jan 18:40 - Tegan: That tk maxx sucks. It's all 'business'
14 Jan 18:40 - Shaggy: Would you need to brush them regularly?
14 Jan 18:41 - Tegan: Ha
14 Jan 18:43 - Hannah: I think teeth for pubes as only few people would know your secret
14 Jan 18:44 - Hannah: Unless of course you made whipping them out a great party trick
14 Jan 18:44 - Shaggy: Wouldn't everyone have that?
14 Jan 18:44 - Shaggy: I thought it was like an evolutionary question
14 Jan 18:45 - Bunn: Just you
14 Jan 18:45 - Bunn: Sex would be weird if everyone had it
14 Jan 18:45 - Bunn: Probably quite painful too
14 Jan 18:45 - Tegan: Nah,  it makes more sense if it's everyone
14 Jan 18:46 - Bunn: A lot of danger of getting chomped
14 Jan 18:46 - Tegan: Otherwise theres no rationale for it happening at all
14 Jan 18:46 - Shaggy: Living on the edge, baby
14 Jan 18:46 - Bunn: Its a 'would YOU rather' question though
14 Jan 18:47 - Tegan: You'd probably develop some kind of defense
14 Jan 18:47 - Shaggy: That's very egocentric
14 Jan 18:47 - Tegan: Like an armadillo
14 Jan 18:47 - Tegan: Is also negative banter
14 Jan 18:47 - Bunn: I guess if everyone got asked the question and made a choice
14 Jan 18:47 - Bunn: Then if they disnt have a mouth full of pubes
14 Jan 18:48 - Bunn: It would be safe to assume they went for the teeth for pubes option
14 Jan 18:48 - Bunn: And you could have weird teeth crunching sex
14 Jan 18:49 - Tegan: Beautiful
14 Jan 18:49 - Shaggy: Not from behind
14 Jan 18:49 - Bunn: That might be the only option in this weird fantasy world
14 Jan 18:50 - Shaggy: Would you have pubic milk teeth?
14 Jan 18:51 - Bunn: Gross. Just picturing someone with pubes for teeth is making me ill
14 Jan 18:51 - Tegan: Agreed
14 Jan 18:51 - Shaggy: I meant the other way around
14 Jan 18:52 - Tegan: Always having hair in your mouth might be one of the worst feeling things
14 Jan 18:52 - Shaggy: You probably get used to it. You could style it all you want with saliva
14 Jan 18:52 - Tegan: Blerk
14 Jan 19:01 - Mike Prime: 53 new messages
14 Jan 19:01 - Mike Prime: Wtf guys

14 Jan 19:03 - Hannah: You've really helped me here
14 Jan 19:09 - Sam Roberts: I've spent too long thinking about this
14 Jan 19:10 - Sam Roberts: But I'm down for pubes for teeth
14 Jan 19:10 - Sam Roberts: You could trim them right down, and I think having a Johnson ringed with teeth is like saying goodbye to sex
14 Jan 19:12 - Mike Prime: I refuse to read the rest of this conversation
14 Jan 19:13 - Mike Prime: Wouldn't teeth for pubes look like awesome ivory underwear
14 Jan 19:13 - Mike Prime: Id go that
14 Jan 19:24 - Tegan: That's how I was picturing it, Mike
14 Jan 19:24 - Tegan: Kinda tribal

15 Jan 15:04 - Tegan: No one needs plague
15 Jan 15:05 - Shaggy: Did you do that for Kenya?

16 Jan 13:17 - Bunn: Leaving crocodile and snake for bongo and cate
16 Jan 13:18 - Shaggy: Sam should be dragon with body considering he actually has it tattooed on his shoulder
16 Jan 13:18 - Shaggy: Unless of course he got it to honour mike
16 Jan 13:32 - Tegan: Thanks Bunn
16 Jan 13:32 - Tegan: I didn't even want an animal
16 Jan 13:33 - Tegan: So shut up
16 Jan 13:35 - Bunn: Aw i thought you claimed one earlier!
16 Jan 13:36 - Sam Roberts: You're such a party animal, you don't need a substitute
16 Jan 13:37 - Bunn: Well since Cate doesnt even have whatsapp then take hers
16 Jan 13:37 - Bunn: Croc or snake
16 Jan 13:37 - Sam Roberts: And yeah shaggy, the tat is actually my vision of Mike as a dragon
16 Jan 13:37 - Bunn: Leaving bongo with the last
16 Jan 13:42 - Mike Prime: I think we all know cate wants to be snake
16 Jan 13:44 - Bunn: Looks like a gave phil the cow
16 Jan 13:44 - Bunn: But on closer inspection its some sort of dog/big cat
16 Jan 13:45 - Bunn: He can have the camel
16 Jan 13:45 - Bunn: They like to party right?
16 Jan 13:45 - Shaggy: Too fast for Phil, is there a sloth?

16 Jan 13:51 - Shaggy: No, I'll ask
16 Jan 14:18 - Phil 2: I'm the wolf aooooooo
16 Jan 14:22 - Bunn: I'm the ferocious white bunny rabbit
16 Jan 14:23 - Bunn: <Media omitted>
16 Jan 14:25 - Phil 2: Messy eater, making out with a dude. Yea that's bunn all over.
16 Jan 14:26 - Shaggy: <Media omitted>
16 Jan 14:30 - Bunn: I said ferocious not rampant
16 Jan 14:32 - Shaggy: I tried to find that but now my google history is probably on sex offenders list
16 Jan 14:33 - Bunn: Haha
16 Jan 15:12 - Dave Mendes da Costa: I'd like to be the cross between a snake a the toilet duck. Xx
16 Jan 15:33 - Shaggy: @tegan think that place is no more
16 Jan 15:34 - Tegan: Yes, I couldn't find it. Ah well, a walk after dinner will prepare us for boogies.
16 Jan 15:39 - Owen: Eliza I think the one above boar might be a fox.
16 Jan 15:41 - Phil 2: Isn't there a wolf spirit emote? I'm all about the wolf spirit.
16 Jan 16:14 - Eliza Bott: BOAR!
16 Jan 16:14 - Dave Mendes da Costa: DUCK!
16 Jan 16:25 - Tegan: Ok lucky people, I have booked for 16 at Kokeb, off Caledonian Rd, at 7.30 on Saturday.  Let's see what happens. ..

16 Jan 18:52 - Bongo: Happy bday Dave!
16 Jan 18:53 - Bongo: Also, if we're all choosing spirit animals I'm a jaguar.
16 Jan 18:54 - Tegan: Good choice
16 Jan 18:55 - Owen: We are not choosing spirit animals we are choosing which animal in the animal party we are.

16 Jan 18:56 - Hannah: That's me
16 Jan 19:51 - Phil 2: You're no jaguar man. You're Wubong the monkey king.
17 Jan 15:52 - Sam Roberts: What's everyone doing tonight? Looks like I'm smashing a couple of pints (lemonade) then in for a late night (playing computer games)
17 Jan 16:03 - Hannah: <Media omitted>

19 Jan 18:48 - Martha: Tickets will be 330 dollars I think.
19 Jan 18:49 - Martha: DO IT xxx
19 Jan 20:17 - Sam Roberts: I got me a profile! Thoughts on what we should take to barter with? I was thinking dance lessons for the paralytic
19 Jan 21:36 - Vanessa: I've done my profile
20 Jan 19:41 - Tegan: By the by, I couldn't find my sailor's hat when I left c town this morning. Which was a shame as I wanted to wear it. If you come across it,  do let me know.
20 Jan 21:04 - Sam Roberts: Wolf of wall street Wednesday? Cheap tickets and good films, what's not to love!
20 Jan 21:08 - Bongo: Yea I'm up for that.
20 Jan 21:13 - Shaggy: Tickets are cheaper on Tuesdays and for everybody, not just orange. Where's burger club?
20 Jan 21:14 - Dave Mendes da Costa: I'm up for tomorrow. So are o and e
20 Jan 21:14 - Shaggy: Burgur club
20 Jan 21:15 - Dave Mendes da Costa: Hmm, can we do both? Is there a docklands burger place? Or a cinema near a burger bar?
20 Jan 21:23 - Sam Roberts: I'm busy tomorrow, y'all wanna burger then film on Wed?
20 Jan 21:23 - Shaggy: But but but....burgurs
20 Jan 21:24 - Sam Roberts: Burgrrrrrs?
20 Jan 21:24 - Dave Mendes da Costa: There was a double film plan. Wall at tomoro and 12 years a slave on Wednesday
20 Jan 21:24 - Dave Mendes da Costa: Thoughts?
20 Jan 21:25 - Sam Roberts: V's not around, you'll have to schism the snacks
20 Jan 21:25 - Sam Roberts: I can't do tomorrow and quite want to see it, t'other way round?
20 Jan 21:27 - Dave Mendes da Costa: Owen, Eliza? Make yourselves heard!
20 Jan 21:28 - Shaggy: Don't care about slavery, want money
20 Jan 21:29 - Shaggy: Also I thought v is not around in feb
20 Jan 21:41 - Vanessa: Yup not around in Feb but also I can't do burger club tomorrow. Next Tuesday is good though, and then you get to be co-president for two weeks!
20 Jan 22:03 - Bongo: So where are we going for burgers tomorrow?
20 Jan 22:03 - Bongo: Shake shack?
20 Jan 22:04 - Martha: I want the money too. Mmm dicaprio. Can do tomorrow but not Wednesday. BURGER BURGER BURGER yay!
20 Jan 22:18 - Tegan: I forged my week on the understanding that I was going to see Leo tomorrow.  I want that one.
20 Jan 22:19 - Tegan: Also can't do Wednesday
20 Jan 22:49 - Eliza Bott: We'll be wolfing tomorrow tegs. 7.40 showing?
20 Jan 22:56 - Sam Roberts: Treachery! I hate you all
20 Jan 22:56 - Martha: I'm down with the treachery. Whereabouts?
20 Jan 22:57 - Dave Mendes da Costa: Canary wharf methinks
20 Jan 23:29 - Mike Prime: Not feeling wolf o wall st, but still up for slaves, even though I know you guys are going to pussy out
20 Jan 23:30 - Mike Prime: Will there still be a burger group?
20 Jan 23:42 - Sam Roberts: I'll revel in the human exploitation with you Mike
20 Jan 23:42 - Sam Roberts: It's either that or salsa dancing. I'll take human suffering every time
20 Jan 23:47 - Phil 2: Wows has the fat guy from the mclovin film. T'should be good.
21 Jan 12:11 - Tegan: Looking for a likely burger on the wharf. .. byron gets all the reviews
21 Jan 12:11 - Tegan: But is Super expensive
21 Jan 12:12 - Shaggy: Same price as all others
21 Jan 12:13 - Tegan: Also dave had some ulterior motive for not going
21 Jan 12:13 - Tegan: Other option is GBK, which is not at all original
21 Jan 12:13 - Tegan: But is full of food
21 Jan 12:14 - Shaggy: Gbk is quite good, lots I burger options
21 Jan 12:18 - Tegan: Plenty of time for votes and debate throughout the afternoon
21 Jan 12:59 - Owen: Me and eliza are seeing wolf tonight.
21 Jan 13:00 - Dave Mendes da Costa: We're joining you. Looking to see if we can burger on the wharf beforehand
21 Jan 13:03 - Owen: Me and eliza are eating at home. We shall come for drinks after you burgharrrgh though
21 Jan 13:07 - Dave Mendes da Costa: Aight. Any votes on burger venue tonight?
21 Jan 13:26 - Sam Roberts: I recommend Byron, it's slightly more expensive but a thousand times more deliciou
21 Jan 13:26 - Sam Roberts: What time's the film?
21 Jan 13:31 - Eliza Bott: 7.30 or 8.15 - would prefer the earlier time as the film is almost 3 hours long...
21 Jan 13:40 - Martha: Yikes. Yes please, earlier rather than later for me too. Is there another venue where we can see it even earlier? Xx
21 Jan 14:38 - Tegan: Earlier showing is best- can people make 6.30 for dinner? Advantage of the wharf is the cheap tuesday which I am keen to take advantage of
21 Jan 14:42 - Sam Roberts: O2 is cineworld as well, if that helps
21 Jan 14:43 - Owen: üêäRarrrgh!!! Stomp!!! Smash!!!üêä
21 Jan 14:45 - Eliza Bott: There is a showing at 6.40 at canary wharf, but not sure that leaves time for eating? I need to eat something before 3 hour film...
21 Jan 14:46 - Owen: ÓÄùwhoooshÓÄù
21 Jan 14:53 - Eliza Bott: Shun Owen
21 Jan 14:54 - Eliza Bott: Oop, that was supposed to be 'shhh Owen'. But that will do just as well.
21 Jan 15:38 - Owen: üê©woof woofüê©
21 Jan 15:50 - Tegan: I agree. With Lize. Hard to agree with Owen here. That is to say, not eating before a 3 hour movie will make me cross. Meet at 6? I'm going to vote GBK because the veggie selection at byron looks half arsed, but I could be persuaded by the pain of others for Scottish meat.  If it were a thing.
21 Jan 15:52 - Mike Prime: I partly agree with Owen. I think his crocodile was way off though
21 Jan 16:03 - Dave Mendes da Costa: I agree with everybody! Merry Christmas! Xx
21 Jan 16:38 - Tegan: Useful stuff, guys.
21 Jan 16:39 - Dave Mendes da Costa: Gbk please. Byron looks weak for the veg veg
21 Jan 16:47 - Tegan: Cool. See you there at 6.15 ish?
21 Jan 17:23 - Eliza Bott: We've eaten, but we'll be there ~6.45 for pudding and drinks!
21 Jan 17:23 - Tegan: Sounds right- catch you soon
21 Jan 17:23 - Martha: Eat without me, I'll be there when I can xxx
21 Jan 17:42 - Tegan: Anyone else eating?
21 Jan 17:50 - Owen: üêÑ Growl üêÑ
21 Jan 17:52 - Shaggy: Not coming tonight, so don't wait up
21 Jan 17:53 - Owen: ÓÑõ booooo ÓÑõ ... come!
21 Jan 17:53 - Martha: Aw shagaroo
21 Jan 17:54 - Owen: Goddamitt there is no kangaroo emoticon!
21 Jan 17:58 - Bunn: Me neither. Shaggy and i are bumming
21 Jan 17:59 - Owen: There is definitely not an emoticon for that ÓÑá
21 Jan 17:59 - Owen: Although on a casual glance that might suffice. Ewwwww
21 Jan 18:00 - Owen: ÓêùÓê†ÓêöüëÖ these could all suffice actually.
21 Jan 18:49 - Owen: Where is this gbk?
21 Jan 18:51 - Martha: On my way! Canary wharf right?
21 Jan 18:54 - Dave Mendes da Costa: It's underground. We went for nandos instead which is next door.
21 Jan 18:54 - Dave Mendes da Costa: And yes, canary wharf x
21 Jan 19:04 - Owen: We have caught up with dave and teegs. We have left nandos. We are in m&s.
21 Jan 19:05 - Dave Mendes da Costa: Good update
21 Jan 19:08 - Martha: Indeed.
21 Jan 19:09 - Martha: I am at green park, catching the jubilee and willing it to HURRY UP with all of my might x
21 Jan 19:27 - Martha: 'ere, well, almost. See you in the cinema foyer? Have we got tickets?
21 Jan 19:59 - Owen: üê™ÓÑÜ

21 Jan 20:25 - Owen: Snow dick????
21 Jan 20:25 - Owen: Wtf???
21 Jan 20:31 - Bunn: How do i get them??
21 Jan 20:44 - Vanessa: It's an app called emoji
21 Jan 20:44 - Vanessa: That's the one I use
21 Jan 20:51 - Bongo: For snow penises?
21 Jan 22:24 - Bunn: How was the film guys?
21 Jan 23:28 - Mike Prime: Did it finish yet?
22 Jan 00:23 - Dave Mendes da Costa: It finished. It was pretty good, didn't feel like three hours. There are some great scenes and it's very entertaining but a bit shallow. Perhaps that's the point.
22 Jan 00:39 - Tegan: I really liked it. I laughed heartily as di Caprio got fucked up and commited fraud. Thumbs up.
22 Jan 00:40 - Dave Mendes da Costa: üê•
22 Jan 00:44 - Martha: ÓÄΩÓÄé
22 Jan 00:45 - Martha: Booya
22 Jan 13:52 - Martha: <Media omitted>
22 Jan 14:01 - Owen: Obviously I love this!
22 Jan 16:17 - Sam Roberts: Anyone on for slavery tonight?
22 Jan 16:20 - Mike Prime: Yeyah. Showing at 6.20 or 7.40
22 Jan 16:20 - Sam Roberts: 7.40 for me, more late working!
22 Jan 16:20 - Mike Prime: Works for mr
22 Jan 16:20 - Mike Prime: *me
22 Jan 17:55 - Mike Prime: You gona eat beforehand?
22 Jan 17:56 - Mike Prime: Got a feeling this isn't going to be a popcorn movie
22 Jan 18:04 - Sam Roberts: Every movie is a popcorn movie
22 Jan 18:04 - Sam Roberts: Think I'll grab a sandwich to eat in there, want anything from Tesco?
22 Jan 18:06 - Bunn: Classy
22 Jan 18:38 - Mike Prime: Get me a sandwich plz
22 Jan 18:38 - Mike Prime: You got orange weds?
22 Jan 18:38 - Sam Roberts: Yeah and yeah
22 Jan 22:15 - Mike Prime: I'm really sad now
23 Jan 00:02 - Owen: Slaves?
23 Jan 08:33 - Mike Prime: Slaves.
23 Jan 08:33 - Mike Prime: That film was amazing, but so damn tough
23 Jan 08:55 - Sam Roberts: I thought it was pretty optimistic actually
23 Jan 08:57 - Sam Roberts: It's basically the sorry of a man getting away from all his rich superficial friends, and starting a life of outdoor living, where he gets to travel and lot and meet a wide variety of people
23 Jan 08:58 - Owen: You should be one of those voltswagen "see film differently" people sam.
23 Jan 09:00 - Mike Prime: Haha. It also makes it easier if you watch it as the prequel to Django Unchained
23 Jan 10:00 - Phil 2: The trailer made it look like a goofy, happy film.
23 Jan 10:09 - Tegan: It's a bromance, no?
23 Jan 10:30 - Shaggy: Interracial bromance, all about promoting diversity
23 Jan 10:55 - Shaggy: Does la bodega negra ring a bell? Sounds familiar but can't remember if anyone suggested going
23 Jan 11:11 - Sam Roberts: We went for a couple of drinks there with v one time, it's ok, too busy semi-authentic Mexican place, they get pissy if you don't order food though
23 Jan 11:11 - Sam Roberts: You going?
23 Jan 11:12 - Shaggy: No, someone mentioned it and it seemed familiar
23 Jan 17:44 - Tegan: Any fun planned this evening?
23 Jan 18:03 - Sam Roberts: Woooo climbing! actually I'm probably not making it, l looks like frustrating work, kebab and early night tonight
23 Jan 18:06 - Tegan: How would it be if I finished my frustrating work, came over and cooked something even better than a kebab, and then stared at your tv?
23 Jan 18:07 - Tegan: Obviously the plan would still work if you really wanted a kebab
23 Jan 18:16 - Shaggy: Sounds great tegs, come on round
23 Jan 18:23 - Sam Roberts: I might get a kebab, and put it in whatever you cook
23 Jan 18:23 - Sam Roberts: That sounds delicious
23 Jan 18:30 - Dave Mendes da Costa: I'm hungry
23 Jan 18:31 - Tegan: Me too. And I'm bored.  Pretty sure I've stopped learning now.
23 Jan 18:32 - Tegan: I'm going to head of to prepare noodle soup a la kebab :)
23 Jan 18:51 - Dave Mendes da Costa: Num x
23 Jan 19:58 - Bongo: Inspiring, i might follow suit
24 Jan 10:16 - Sam Roberts: I'm going for dinner and dancing with Cate in Brixton tonight, anyone fancy it?
24 Jan 13:42 - Mike Prime: Feelin pretty ill still, so no to dancing. Is she coming to Ctown this weekend? Might come say hi if not
24 Jan 14:53 - Sam Roberts: Staying at ours tonight
24 Jan 18:08 - Sam Roberts: Anyone having a drink anywhere interesting? Massive fail by the work people
24 Jan 18:11 - Tegan: We're going to head out and meet Cate when she arrives for a pre dance drink.  Probs not til 8.30-9 though
24 Jan 18:34 - Hannah: Poor fanny!
24 Jan 18:34 - Hannah: <Media omitted>
24 Jan 18:36 - Owen: HA!
24 Jan 18:40 - Bunn: Sam! Dry january?
24 Jan 18:43 - Sam Roberts: Haven't decided, this was gonna be my night off, might just stick it out though
24 Jan 18:43 - Bunn: Who needs drinking anyway?
24 Jan 18:43 - Tegan: A delicate decision...
24 Jan 18:47 - Sam Roberts: Yeah right? I don't even miss that sweet sweet refreshing life giving gmgghghhmg I want a beer
24 Jan 18:47 - Tegan: I feel bad for failing dry january. But beer helps me to forget.

24 Jan 20:12 - Tegan: Slam, where did you go?
24 Jan 20:12 - Tegan: Are you meeting cate for a drink? We were gonna come with...
25 Jan 14:52 - Bongo: Any of you not seen wolf of wall str yet? We're seeing it at 7:30 at canary wharf tonight.
25 Jan 14:57 - Shaggy: Mmm not too psyched. It's super long
25 Jan 15:00 - Sam Roberts: Yeah I want to see it, I also really don't want to leave the house though, so let's sew how it pans out
25 Jan 15:03 - Bongo: Well I'm coming round to pick up my squash racket before it starts so I'll throw  in some chicken and motivation juice (beer).
25 Jan 15:03 - Shaggy: Have you caved in as well?
25 Jan 15:04 - Tegan: It's well worth seeing, Shaggy-i laughed a lot, and it didn't seem like 3 hours
25 Jan 15:04 - Vanessa: Can you bring my gloves please
25 Jan 15:05 - Owen: Tegan we didn't go with shaggy. We went with Martha and dave and eliza.
25 Jan 15:05 - Tegan: Theres a bit where he takes so much of some kind of sedative that he goes straight to cerebral palsy phase- I think you'd relate ;)
25 Jan 15:05 - Tegan: I was pointing that comment at Shaggy
25 Jan 15:05 - Tegan: As I feel was clear from my perfect syntax
25 Jan 15:06 - Owen: I will sin against your tax in a minute!  üëπ
25 Jan 15:08 - Tegan: Meaningless,  but perfectly formed
25 Jan 15:08 - Tegan: ÓÑé
25 Jan 15:10 - Tegan: In other news, our engine started! Whoop!
25 Jan 15:13 - Shaggy: Ah yes, admiral Dave and his brave crew, comprising solely of sailor Tegan, brave the canals again.
25 Jan 15:13 - Tegan: I am so brave
25 Jan 15:14 - Sam Roberts: Like a lion, who realised he's had a heart all along
25 Jan 15:15 - Sam Roberts: Um, i might have lost your racket bong
25 Jan 15:15 - Sam Roberts: You playing sometime?
25 Jan 15:36 - Bongo: I was going to play tomorrow, is it lost outside of the house? Cus I think I moved it around last time I was there.
25 Jan 15:39 - Bunn: <Media omitted>
25 Jan 15:44 - Sam Roberts: Haha awesome!
25 Jan 15:45 - Sam Roberts: I'm pretty bemused to be honest, mine and yours are definitely in the house somewhere, but I spent awhile looking last weekend and couldn't find either
25 Jan 20:01 - Bongo: <Media omitted>
25 Jan 20:02 - Sam Roberts: Dog?
25 Jan 20:05 - Mike Prime: <Media omitted>
25 Jan 20:47 - Owen: Guys what is focus?
25 Jan 20:48 - Dave Mendes da Costa: <Media omitted>
25 Jan 20:48 - Dave Mendes da Costa: An important lesson for us all
25 Jan 21:35 - Mike Prime: <Media omitted>
25 Jan 21:41 - Bunn: Lol!
26 Jan 11:04 - Sam Roberts: Anyone up for doing tough mudder or something similar? I want to do it one year
26 Jan 11:05 - Shaggy: Pass
26 Jan 11:16 - Tegan: I don't need to prove how hard I am
26 Jan 11:17 - Tegan: I just feel it, y'know?
26 Jan 11:18 - Vanessa: I'm def up for doing it
26 Jan 11:19 - Vanessa: But I don't like the electric field
26 Jan 11:25 - Bunn: Tempted
26 Jan 11:32 - Mike Prime: I hate getting muddy
26 Jan 11:32 - Mike Prime: Which might be a problem
26 Jan 11:41 - Bongo: I'm up for it, need some serious endurance training beforehand though.
26 Jan 12:07 - Sam Roberts: I'm going to cut down smoking, if I limit it to ten a day I'm pretty sure the thing will be easy
26 Jan 12:09 - Vanessa: If you train hard you'll actually not want to smoke
26 Jan 12:25 - Hannah: No worries if you already had a charity in mind to raise money for - but if not, can I suggest a charity to donate any fundraising money to?
26 Jan 12:25 - Hannah: One I work with every summer (mencaaap)
26 Jan 12:29 - Sam Roberts: Oh yeah, I forgot it was supposed to be a charity thing as well
26 Jan 12:30 - Sam Roberts: Well do though, the bit I've heard about them sounds like a really good thing to be involved with

26 Jan 13:22 - Owen: I suggest the "eliza's taxes" charity. Jesus tax is expensive! I swear she is paying more thab starbucks!
26 Jan 13:26 - Sam Roberts: From a user of public dentistry and streetlights, thanks Liza!
26 Jan 13:26 - Bunn: #notenoughtax
26 Jan 13:28 - Owen: It sucks. I recieve nothing from the tax payer. NOTHING!!!
26 Jan 14:22 - Tegan: I love paying my taxes - really feels like I'm giving something back
26 Jan 14:23 - Tegan: #paidbyDfID
26 Jan 14:40 - Sam Roberts: Department for injoying dicks?
26 Jan 14:40 - Sam Roberts: That's not how you spell enjoying teeg
26 Jan 15:05 - Tegan: Ha
26 Jan 16:33 - Mike Prime: Anyone wana see coen bros film this week?

26 Jan 20:10 - Vanessa: No but I recommend watching the tv series The Killing
26 Jan 20:21 - Owen: The killing is ace. Orange is the new black is also good.
26 Jan 21:03 - Dave Mendes da Costa: My life as a turkey - lifechanging
26 Jan 21:04 - Dave Mendes da Costa: 'O brother where are thou' is great if you've not seen it
26 Jan 21:06 - Bunn: Even better if you take a lot of ketamine before too
27 Jan 20:51 - Bongo: Damnit I'm only just getting into Chinese man, that shit is so groovy
27 Jan 21:47 - Bongo: Did you end up seeing them last week Sam?
27 Jan 22:06 - Eliza Bott: Have you watched the first episode of Archer where Archer is a velociraptor? It's pretty funny.
27 Jan 22:17 - Mike Prime: I watched that episode randomly with no context. Was so confused
27 Jan 22:22 - Owen: It makes the show even better.
28 Jan 00:47 - Sam Roberts: Didn't get to see them, I thought it was a good idea to get tickets on the door. It wasn't!
28 Jan 12:58 - Sam Roberts: Happy burger day everyone! Honest burger tonight, it's on Dean street just by Soho square
28 Jan 12:58 - Sam Roberts: I'll try and get there for 7 to get a table, it gets busy but there's a bunch of other places nearby if it's too bad
28 Jan 13:27 - Vanessa: I won't make it until 7:30 but it's def good that you're going before, thanks!
28 Jan 17:36 - Tegan: Yay for Ukraine! Baby steps.
28 Jan 17:57 - Shaggy: Need the president to go as well, although a whole cabinet is already good
28 Jan 18:02 - Tegan: It's a start I guess.  The beeb say no barricades will move until the president steps down. Excellent protesting.
28 Jan 18:03 - Shaggy: No half measures. They should get relentless so sponsor the people
28 Jan 18:05 - Phil 2: Óêª viva la refishlution
28 Jan 18:29 - Bongo: Just received a bollocking from a very angry, very pregnant Chinese business analyst.
28 Jan 18:30 - Bongo: That's definitely going in the top ten scariest things I've seen
28 Jan 18:35 - Shaggy: Did you have a stapler misaligned with the energy flow of a building?
28 Jan 18:47 - Bunn: So angry she nearly gave birth?

28 Jan 19:15 - Vanessa: I'm on my way. Did you get a table?
28 Jan 19:20 - Sam Roberts: We're on a list, how fancy!
28 Jan 19:20 - Vanessa: How long did they say the wait was?
28 Jan 19:20 - Vanessa: Sorry "is"
28 Jan 19:21 - Phil 2: Negatory. between 1.5 and 2 hours wait. We might be able to get one outside instantly but we can't reserve it.
28 Jan 19:21 - Sam Roberts: Long! We can have a team meeting when you're here
28 Jan 19:22 - Vanessa: Arghh what is wrong with people eating burgers so freakin slow!
28 Jan 19:23 - Sam Roberts: Yeah right!? I bet they stop to chew and everything!
28 Jan 19:23 - Phil 2: It's part of the slow eating agenda.
29 Jan 13:29 - Tegan: New Coen brothers film tonight?  Whose on orange?

29 Jan 15:00 - Tegan: Thank you Slam

29 Jan 15:23 - Mike Prime: What time you wana go? Times look a bit annoying - 1815 or 2045 in all the cineworlds near ours. Its only 105 minutes long tho
29 Jan 15:55 - Dave Mendes da Costa: 2045? Tegs?
29 Jan 15:58 - Mike Prime: I need to know soon, cause I gotta book a shuttle to the station
29 Jan 16:01 - Tegan: Either good for me. If we go to the late one we can eat first
29 Jan 16:01 - Tegan: Mmmm... eat
29 Jan 16:01 - Tegan: Do we have a fourth person?
29 Jan 17:15 - Mike Prime: Food in C wharf? Will be around for about 7.30
29 Jan 17:39 - Tegan: Poifect
29 Jan 18:28 - Dave Mendes da Costa: Sounds good
29 Jan 18:31 - Sam Roberts: Still haven't got that code, will you need it?
29 Jan 18:32 - Dave Mendes da Costa: Doesn't look like it unless anyone else wants to join
29 Jan 18:33 - Mike Prime: Did you ever get one last week? Maybe they don't like you anymore
29 Jan 18:47 - Sam Roberts: I think that's it! I got it at the end of the film, guess I've got to call them sometime
29 Jan 18:54 - Sam Roberts: Oh! Next Friday is birthday time! Make sure y'all keep it free (7th)
29 Jan 18:54 - Sam Roberts: I'll get a proper plan together, but we'll head to Birthdays in Dalston for sure
29 Jan 18:58 - Tegan: Sweet
29 Jan 19:16 - Dave Mendes da Costa: Is anyone at the wharf yet? X
29 Jan 19:08 - Bongo: Lol erectile dysfunction is an endorsed skill on LinkedIn, totes endorsing Sam for that.
29 Jan 19:25 - Dave Mendes da Costa: Mike - Tegs thinks we should get tickets then eat to avoid disappointment. What's the code and when are you getting in?
29 Jan 19:25 - Mike Prime: I'm here now at station
29 Jan 19:28 - Dave Mendes da Costa: Cool. I'm waiting for Tegs by the wasabi near the DLR.

30 Jan 09:34 - Vanessa: <Media omitted>
30 Jan 09:35 - Vanessa: Look who runs the Canning Town block
30 Jan 09:37 - Owen: That's not actually hannah is it? Are you sure this isn't just a joke about that den of iniquity shaggy calls his home?
30 Jan 09:55 - Sam Roberts: Very talented lady!
30 Jan 10:43 - Hannah: What can I say, I'm just hannah from the block
30 Jan 12:37 - Shaggy: And you got the booty to prove it
30 Jan 14:54 - Hannah: Used to have a little now I have a lot
30 Jan 14:54 - Hannah: No matter where I go I know where I came from
30 Jan 15:01 - Mike Prime: The mean streets of Rugby
30 Jan 15:04 - Shaggy: Where I came from might not be a country soon. Again
30 Jan 15:45 - Owen: Do you have dual citizenship or are you just British? If the former what would happen?
30 Jan 16:05 - Shaggy: Just British
30 Jan 16:06 - Shaggy: If the former it would have depended on the new country dual citizenship laws as well as process of re-establishing citizenship in a newly formed country given the citizenship in the old one
30 Jan 16:24 - Tegan: Lots of people, especially rural,  become citizens of nowhere that way.  Sad.
30 Jan 17:02 - Bunn: Sounds pretty awesome being a citizen of nowhere
30 Jan 17:03 - Bunn: Destined to wander the earths surface looking for justice
30 Jan 17:03 - Bunn: And....
30 Jan 17:03 - Bunn: Revenge
30 Jan 17:31 - Tegan: Yeeeaahh
30 Jan 17:37 - Bunn: *epic 80s guitar solo*
30 Jan 18:54 - Tegan: Except you'd mainly be playing epic guitar solos in border control cells
30 Jan 18:55 - Tegan: They'd still be epic, obviously
31 Jan 09:27 - Shaggy: Uff tea - does everyone have threads to wear for this?
31 Jan 09:46 - Eliza Bott: I think I've got something... is this weekend best for everyone?
31 Jan 09:57 - Bongo: Gong hei fa choi! Or happy new year for all you guilo's.
31 Jan 09:58 - Shaggy: Tom yum goong with pak choi to you too!
31 Jan 10:21 - Owen: Awesome. Is anyone up for coming to the new year celebrations on sunday. It was awesome fun last year in spite of the rain.  And apparently sunday will be dry.
31 Jan 10:45 - Phil 2: It's guailo you round-eyed devil.
31 Jan 11:05 - Sam Roberts: Aw yeah! Racist mcs are my favorite! I'm heading over with James about midday Sunday, fingers crossed for sunshine
31 Jan 11:07 - Owen: Nice. I will join you as eliza refuses to go ÓêÉ
31 Jan 13:16 - Shaggy: http://forgotify.com
31 Jan 13:22 - Sam Roberts: Aww that's cute. I bet they're all really bad

31 Jan 13:35 - Vanessa: Aww that's really cute and sweet
31 Jan 14:28 - Tegan: I wonder how long it will take for those 4 million songs to get one hit each
31 Jan 14:29 - Shaggy: Ever the optimist
31 Jan 16:06 - Mike Prime: Who's pubbing this eve?
31 Jan 16:13 - Shaggy: Pass
31 Jan 16:14 - Sam Roberts: I'm in for a quiet one out two somewhere, Alan's bailed though
31 Jan 16:14 - Bunn: Will shaggy ever be fun again?
31 Jan 16:15 - Shaggy: Pass
31 Jan 16:23 - Tegan: Boo! I definitely need some beer. Sigh. Old street still?
31 Jan 16:26 - Mike Prime: Yeah, I'll be there about 630
31 Jan 16:57 - Tegan: Sounds good
31 Jan 18:30 - Mike Prime: You about yet teegs? In lieu of imagination, I'm heading to road trip
31 Jan 18:43 - Dave Mendes da Costa: Where's that?
31 Jan 18:45 - Tegan: On me way,  see you in 5
31 Jan 19:07 - Bongo: Lora Matt and me are meeting some peeps in Greenwich for some food then sheesha if anyone wants to come chill
31 Jan 19:08 - Shaggy: That's like miles away
31 Jan 19:09 - Sam Roberts: Greenwich!? Why there? Which bit as well?
31 Jan 19:12 - Sam Roberts: I'm going bent over at work, I'll probably catch y'all back home around 2am
31 Jan 19:15 - Bongo: Centre of Greenwich, we're going to do crazy stuff, if you catch my drift.
31 Jan 19:19 - Bongo: You're bent over at work until 2am?!
31 Jan 19:20 - Bongo: Surely not
31 Jan 19:22 - Sam Roberts: Ok, maybe 8, it's still an infringement of my liberty though
31 Jan 19:22 - Sam Roberts: I'm being oppressed!
31 Jan 19:23 - Bunn: People from canning town complaining that grenwich is far.
31 Jan 19:25 - Mike Prime: I'm still trying to figure out what the crazy stuff is
31 Jan 19:28 - Shaggy: Buttsex
31 Jan 19:28 - Phil 2: Mad bingo yo
31 Jan 19:36 - Bongo: Mad bingo with hookers and nose candy
31 Jan 20:16 - Sam Roberts: What's the sit rep?
31 Jan 20:30 - Mike Prime: Still on shore ditch, might head homewards soon tho
31 Jan 20:54 - Bongo: Sit rep?
31 Jan 20:58 - Sam Roberts: Drink!
31 Jan 20:58 - Sam Roberts: I might do similar then, you coming back to ours teeg?
31 Jan 21:53 - Tegan: Yeeah- I beat you here. Quit working so hard!
1 Feb 00:01 - Mike Prime: Goodbye dry January!
1 Feb 04:40 - Vanessa: <Media omitted>
1 Feb 04:40 - Sam Roberts: Haha five pounds when you get off the plane right?
1 Feb 05:03 - Vanessa: Yup already gained it
1 Feb 10:12 - Phil 2: You gonna come back with a big 'ol ghetto bootay.
1 Feb 10:40 - Dave Mendes da Costa: Move over time mug
1 Feb 10:40 - Dave Mendes da Costa: It's...
1 Feb 10:41 - Dave Mendes da Costa: <Media omitted>
1 Feb 10:41 - Dave Mendes da Costa: Belt watch
1 Feb 10:55 - Mike Prime: Do you want to check the time AND get back problems?
1 Feb 14:18 - Bongo: So what's everyone up to today?
1 Feb 14:18 - Martha: Picking up my new bike
1 Feb 14:20 - Martha: ÓÑ∂
1 Feb 14:21 - Bongo: Nice, is it a proper racing bike?
1 Feb 14:21 - Sam Roberts: Seeing some art with my mum. Rock n roll baby!
1 Feb 14:22 - Sam Roberts: You going to be around central with it about 6 Marth?
1 Feb 14:24 - Martha: Yeah baby! Sammy boy, if by central you mean cycling around Shoreditch trying to score cool points looking like the cool cat that I now am, then yes. So much yes.
1 Feb 14:29 - Bongo: That sounds fun, I'm tempted to buy one just to do that.
1 Feb 14:31 - Sam Roberts: Sounds like a sweet ride, you got a basket and done rainbow tassles for that bad boy?
1 Feb 14:38 - Bunn: International rugby at The Bowler in Clerkenwell!!
1 Feb 14:51 - Martha: Yeah. I went the whole hog and even pimped her out with a shiny new set of training wheels.
2 Feb 17:24 - Phil 2: Cya nerds
2 Feb 17:34 - Tegan: You tour that ski, man!
2 Feb 18:12 - Sam Roberts: Ugh, STILL here!?
2 Feb 19:02 - Bunn: Enjoy mi amigo!!
3 Feb 18:44 - Hannah: Yo Sam
3 Feb 18:44 - Hannah: You still having some bday celebrations this weekend
3 Feb 19:04 - Sam Roberts: Aww yis! To which you are very much invited to, heading to Birthdays in Dalston for 7.30, snacks there (they've got the greatest burgers known to man) and done dutty rap downstairs after
3 Feb 19:05 - Sam Roberts: I keep meaning to send an email or something, but basically everyone I'd send it to is on this thread, so be invited everyone! X
3 Feb 19:41 - Hannah: I have 2 beautiful French girls stayin with me (my Parisienne housemates from when I lived there)
3 Feb 19:42 - Hannah: Is it cool if I bring them?
3 Feb 19:42 - Mike Prime: Um duh
3 Feb 20:01 - Owen: 7:30 friday or Saturday sam?
3 Feb 20:05 - Shaggy: Both days
3 Feb 20:33 - Owen: Do the burgers match this one. Everything is made from scratch... except the colslaw.
3 Feb 20:33 - Owen: <Media omitted>
3 Feb 21:32 - Tegan: I can't believe you couldn't be bothered to make your own coleslaw!
3 Feb 21:32 - Tegan: Slackers
3 Feb 21:49 - Vanessa: It's snowing!
3 Feb 21:49 - Vanessa: <Media omitted>
4 Feb 18:02 - Tegan: Pretty!
4 Feb 18:03 - Tegan: What plans for tonight? Burgers? Or delicious home cooked dinner in c town?
4 Feb 18:20 - Sam Roberts: Meal and a show for me! What's the deal with the American Bunn?
4 Feb 18:26 - Bunn: I think he'll be round tonight
4 Feb 18:28 - Vanessa: I just ordered my burger
4 Feb 18:29 - Sam Roberts: Send us a sepia picture when it gets there please, I HAVE TO KNOW what it looks like!
4 Feb 18:30 - Vanessa: <Media omitted>
4 Feb 18:30 - Vanessa: It's really dark in here
4 Feb 18:31 - Dave Mendes da Costa: Is it cool for Tegs and I to stay over tonight as the tube is gonna make travel to Uxbridge crazy.
4 Feb 18:32 - Sam Roberts: Yarrr! You'll have to wrestle an American for the best bed though. Loser gets Phil's room
4 Feb 18:32 - Sam Roberts: That burger looks like a Ron Swanson special
4 Feb 18:37 - Vanessa: It's a pretty good burger
4 Feb 18:38 - Sam Roberts: Out of ten?
4 Feb 18:39 - Shaggy: That burger looks super tiny
4 Feb 18:39 - Vanessa: 7.5
4 Feb 18:39 - Vanessa: It has a lot of meat
4 Feb 18:41 - Sam Roberts: That's an ok burger, right there. Is it as small as it looks, or are they American style ten gallon coffee cups?
4 Feb 18:41 - Vanessa: Nah it's decent size
4 Feb 18:41 - Vanessa: The plate is huge
4 Feb 20:16 - Mike Prime: What's the craic D&T?
5 Feb 08:52 - Tegan: Hey guys, can someone help me out with the wifi settings in c town- I have the IP address but not the rest. Don't make me go to the office!
5 Feb 09:07 - Mike Prime: <Media omitted>
5 Feb 09:09 - Tegan: Hero! Thanks x
5 Feb 11:11 - Bunn: Is this to stop the wifi being so terrible?
5 Feb 11:12 - Bunn: I need this
5 Feb 11:16 - Shaggy: I'm bringing a router from work to deal with this
5 Feb 14:34 - Tegan: You guys have a little mouse. He is very sweet, but should probably live somewhere else.
5 Feb 14:35 - Tegan: Or as Owen would say, ÓÅì.
5 Feb 15:49 - Shaggy: Her name M-M-M-Monster.
5 Feb 16:11 - Bongo: Maybe she'll have epic battles with the rat. We should arm her and throw a training montage.
5 Feb 16:13 - Bongo: And film the results
5 Feb 16:13 - Bongo: Make lots of money
5 Feb 16:13 - Bongo: And move to brazil
5 Feb 16:18 - Bunn: Home made humane mouse trap anyone?
5 Feb 16:18 - Bunn: Little engineering project
5 Feb 16:27 - Shaggy: We have a glue trap. I suggested we also put spikes and poison on it.
5 Feb 16:37 - Dave Mendes da Costa: Let's buy Mousetrap and use that
5 Feb 17:31 - Tegan: I vote for Bongo's idea. Then Bunn and Dave's
5 Feb 17:36 - Martha: Not shag's "pimp my trap"? We could have had a contest. I'm thinking a mini replica of the canning town drive-through macDs...
5 Feb 17:36 - Martha: Or get a cat!!!!
5 Feb 17:37 - Martha: (So excited I thought of that)
5 Feb 17:37 - Shaggy: Would you rather: use a glue trap and butcher said mouse with a cleaver or capture her with a humane mouse trap and throw outside to die in the freezing cold hinted by canning town ghetto predators?
5 Feb 17:38 - Shaggy: I'm allergic to cats, so fuck you
5 Feb 17:39 - Bunn: Yeah we cant get a cat cos of Shaggy's dumb allergies
5 Feb 17:41 - Tegan: Maybe we should keep it,  and put a waistcoat on it,  and pet it and pet it and pet it?
5 Feb 17:43 - Martha: Replace shaggy with a cat?
5 Feb 17:43 - Martha: ... joke?
5 Feb 17:43 - Shaggy: Hmmm....I could use a better place to live...
5 Feb 17:45 - Sam Roberts: How about a pet that eats mice, but doesn't trigger allergies?
5 Feb 17:46 - Sam Roberts: There's that python going in Bristol, that would be cool
5 Feb 17:46 - Bongo: Didn't we use the glue trap the. Throw it in the snow last time?
5 Feb 17:46 - Shaggy: Perfect! I propose we name it Cate
5 Feb 17:46 - Bongo: I don't think it gets much more inhumane than that
5 Feb 17:47 - Shaggy: Not true. Freezing is one if the better ways to die
5 Feb 17:48 - Sam Roberts: We all eat animals, I don't think we can consistently cry over the slightly uncomfortable death of vermin
5 Feb 17:49 - Sam Roberts: Also, Pete got one with a hammer once, I've always been a bit jealous of that
5 Feb 18:05 - Tegan: That was a terrible sorry.  If mice had a bible, that mouse would almost certainly be jesus.
5 Feb 18:06 - Shaggy: And they would learn not to live in out houses and eat our food. We all live dairy tales. Except the bible. It's terrible
5 Feb 18:06 - Dave Mendes da Costa: Adam Wills joined
5 Feb 18:11 - Tegan: Dave doesn't live dairy tales.
5 Feb 18:11 - Shaggy: Haha so much misspelling
5 Feb 18:16 - Bunn: Wagwan tonight?
5 Feb 18:18 - Sam Roberts: Drink ? Salsa if I can be bothered. It's not looking good. We could do speakers maybe?
5 Feb 18:21 - Bunn: That'd be nice to get done. I'll txt xav
5 Feb 18:21 - Bunn: Wait. Tube strike. We'll do it next week
5 Feb 18:22 - Sam Roberts: Hah, for sure!
5 Feb 18:54 - Tegan: Does this mean there is no plan?
5 Feb 19:22 - Shaggy: I wouldn't rely on those guys to have a plan
5 Feb 20:11 - Sam Roberts: We've got a lot of plans, that's the easy part!
5 Feb 20:39 - Mike Prime: <Media omitted>
5 Feb 20:39 - Mike Prime: Aim high
5 Feb 22:10 - Sam Roberts: Am high?
5 Feb 22:11 - Sam Roberts: Hey if I didn't say before Hannah, about the French friends, hells yeah! The more the merrier! X
6 Feb 00:03 - Shaggy: hbs
6 Feb 08:09 - Eliza Bott: Óçã
6 Feb 08:40 - Sam Roberts: Huzzah for me! :)
6 Feb 09:03 - Bongo: Hbs? You lazy bastard.
6 Feb 09:03 - Bongo: Same from me though
6 Feb 09:05 - Mike Prime: Congrats on not dying yet Sam
6 Feb 09:11 - Sam Roberts: Yeah right? I don't think anyone was expecting that!
6 Feb 09:12 - Sam Roberts: Thanks for the headphones everyone, especially shag for having a half hour conversation about it and I didn't guess!
6 Feb 09:13 - Mike Prime: I lost money on it
6 Feb 09:14 - Owen: üê≤ÓçãÓååüåõÓÄ™ÓÄ†

6 Feb 09:59 - Owen: Which translates as "sam are you doing birthday things tonight? Or frid(shrimp)day night?
6 Feb 10:17 - Bunn: <Media omitted>
6 Feb 10:19 - Bunn: <Media omitted>
6 Feb 10:50 - Sam Roberts: Uh, I'll be getting some drinks in somewhere tonight, probably around Blackfriars or towards c town, but tomorrow night is compulsory fun night, 7.30 at birthdays in Dalston
6 Feb 10:51 - Sam Roberts: The fun is compulsory, so try not to have any today, or you might run out
6 Feb 11:16 - Bunn: Have you booked yeah?
6 Feb 11:17 - Bunn: You've been bigging it up for so long i dont want to be disappointed
6 Feb 11:17 - Sam Roberts: Ah no! Think we need to? I'll give them a call just now
6 Feb 11:17 - Bunn: Duh!
6 Feb 11:27 - Sam Roberts: All booked, sitting down to eat at 9, drinks and biz until then
6 Feb 12:27 - Bongo: Buses are so lame
6 Feb 12:28 - Bongo: Always late and always lame
6 Feb 12:28 - Shaggy: Cycle instead you lazy homo
6 Feb 12:31 - Bongo: But then I wouldn't get to complain and be bitter

6 Feb 17:00 - Dave Mendes da Costa: Will try sam. Not sure what transport is like here. Xx
6 Feb 17:06 - Tegan: Jubilee line is running between stratford and waterloo every 5 mins.
6 Feb 17:07 - Dave Mendes da Costa: How's the northern?
6 Feb 17:08 - Sam Roberts: It's about 10 mins walk from bank, that'll be the easiest for getting home
6 Feb 17:08 - Tegan: Where you wanna go?
6 Feb 17:08 - Tegan: On the Northern line?
6 Feb 17:09 - Tegan: Northern line is good

6 Feb 17:12 - Tegan: DLR isn't on strike
6 Feb 17:12 - Tegan: I'm not sure they have ticket offices
6 Feb 17:12 - Sam Roberts: Dlr's all normal, they replaced the people with robots ages ago
6 Feb 17:13 - Shaggy: They still have drivers, I don't understand why though
6 Feb 17:14 - Tegan: I know,  right?  Who needs people.
6 Feb 17:14 - Tegan: What time are you heading over,  Slam?

7 Feb 17:15 - Tegan: That's the spirit
7 Feb 17:15 - Bunn: I'll probs have some beers near work before heading to Dalston
7 Feb 17:21 - Sam Roberts: Our story opens in a bar top covered in jaegerbombs. In the background a lone voice cries out "won't someone think of the kidneys"
7 Feb 17:57 - Sam Roberts: Where is everyone? I need someone to drink with!
7 Feb 17:58 - Tegan: I'm not ready yet :(
7 Feb 17:59 - Sam Roberts: Gotta get down it's Friday!

7 Feb 19:00 - Sam Roberts: All my dreams are coming true in one night!
7 Feb 19:01 - Owen: Actually I made a mistake. 8:15
7 Feb 19:01 - Owen: Also I did manage to put some boxers on before leaving.
7 Feb 19:02 - Owen: I also got a game of leagues in while waiting for eliza... this is not the reason we are late.
7 Feb 19:02 - Owen: Honest...

8 Feb 13:11 - Bunn: ...
8 Feb 13:12 - Shaggy: üîú
8 Feb 13:25 - Bunn: Joking aside
8 Feb 13:25 - Bunn: I might be up for it!
8 Feb 13:33 - Shaggy: Aren't you doing rugby?

8 Feb 14:27 - Shaggy: @owen
8 Feb 14:28 - Shaggy: <Media omitted>
8 Feb 15:16 - Bongo: What's going on in the Hakka
8 Feb 15:17 - Bongo: I'm down for some shiznit
8 Feb 15:17 - Shaggy: Hakka is the Maori war dance
8 Feb 15:17 - Mike Prime: <Media omitted>
8 Feb 15:23 - Bongo: That's messed up
8 Feb 15:24 - Bongo: Also, why is there a Hakka
8 Feb 15:24 - Shaggy: Waitangi Day
8 Feb 15:24 - Bongo: Where in Westminster is it?
8 Feb 15:27 - Shaggy: In front of parliament
8 Feb 15:47 - Bongo: In this weather?
8 Feb 15:47 - Bongo: Thems is crazy
8 Feb 15:47 - Bongo: Come round here instead
8 Feb 15:48 - Bongo: We have champagne and bloody murders
8 Feb 18:08 - Bongo: So what's everyone up to tonight?
8 Feb 18:12 - Shaggy: Had a nap instead of going anywhere, very productive day so far
8 Feb 18:17 - Bongo: Same, still getting sloshed
8 Feb 18:18 - Mike Prime: What's a bloody murder?
8 Feb 19:07 - Bongo: A Bloody Mary with gin instead of vodka
8 Feb 19:08 - Bongo: Anyone want to come round for sheesha and weed
8 Feb 19:08 - Shaggy: Aptly named, a great drink for dry ginuary
8 Feb 19:15 - Shaggy: Don't think I'm going to make it out of the house today, only just stopped the hangover. Plus it's raining, so cycling's out of the question
8 Feb 19:24 - Bunn: I love naps
8 Feb 19:24 - Bongo: Second
8 Feb 19:24 - Bongo: And chicken
8 Feb 19:25 - Shaggy: Mmmmmmmmmm Dallas chicken
9 Feb 17:13 - Vanessa: It's -22 but feels like -33. It's so cold that there are ice crystals in the air that it looks like permanent glitter
9 Feb 18:03 - Tegan: I can't even begin to fathom what that means! But it sounds beautiful.
9 Feb 18:05 - Shaggy: Sounds like acid
9 Feb 20:51 - Phil 2: Testing
9 Feb 20:51 - Phil 2: Is my whatsapp workin?
9 Feb 20:51 - Phil 2: <Media omitted>
9 Feb 20:51 - Phil 2: <Media omitted>
9 Feb 20:51 - Shaggy: Wow Vienna looks great this time of year
9 Feb 21:01 - Sam Roberts: Jesus see a doctor dude, that stuff looks like an explosion in a mountain dew factory
9 Feb 21:11 - Phil 2: I had to use my superlative paint skills for this. Not for lack of trying with more natural means though. I heroically drank huge amounts of wine and beer. All for the arts and for your birthday you ungrateful swine.
9 Feb 21:15 - Sam Roberts: I greatly appreciate every millilitre of effort you've put in brother, i'll quaff my next tea in your honour!
9 Feb 21:16 - Bunn: Phil i think you wouldv appreciated our heroic drinking games last night
9 Feb 21:36 - Phil 2: From what i'm reading i'm surprised anybody is still alive.
9 Feb 23:53 - Owen: What does "hb8" mean phil?
9 Feb 23:54 - Mike Prime: That's clearly a delta
10 Feb 06:10 - Phil 2: You try writing in natural paint in snow that's up past your knees with shrunken equipment and then editing the results using sophisticated photo manipulation software (sometimes pixel by pixel).
10 Feb 13:13 - Sam Roberts: Now that I'm over the student style hangover that was yesterday, mainly spent curled around the toilet wishing for the sweet release of death, thanks to all of you for making Friday an almost perfect night! My only regret is that I never got down to see the stabby rap room, I blame whoever said they were playing Destinies Child at about 11!
10 Feb 13:13 - Mike Prime: Seen it
10 Feb 13:14 - Sam Roberts: Also special thanks to Bongo for saving everyone a massive headache and putting the meal on his card, that must've been huge so please make sure people pay him back!
10 Feb 20:11 - Bongo: Damn I just replied on the other channel - most people paid and some people over paid so whatevs everyone who's left can just buy me a pint
10 Feb 20:12 - Bongo: That was hella fun seeing everyone as well, we should do mass meals more often
10 Feb 20:18 - Hannah: My friend just discovered a new Nordic themed bar which is apparently great fun, we should all goooo
10 Feb 20:34 - Sam Roberts: Done! When?
10 Feb 20:55 - Bongo: Nordic = shouting loads and pounding on tables yes?
10 Feb 20:55 - Bongo: Then I'm in as well.
10 Feb 22:37 - Owen: I don't want to alarm you all but I have the makings ofa game better than the demon game.
10 Feb 22:38 - Sam Roberts: Give us titillating hints!
11 Feb 15:06 - Tegan: Very excited about this,  owen
11 Feb 15:07 - Tegan: Guys, I heard some terrible hippies left clothes,  hats and ukeleles all over your house- can we come over to tidy up after them please?
11 Feb 15:07 - Sam Roberts: It's ok, we burnt it all, back to the normal c-town squalor now
11 Feb 15:09 - Sam Roberts: You'd be very welcome to come dance in the ashes though, Mike's probably the best bet for tonight x
11 Feb 15:17 - Eliza Bott: Some titillating hints...spies... moles... scavenger hunt... Ooooh!
11 Feb 17:23 - Tegan: I like the ooooh bit best
11 Feb 17:24 - Tegan: How's about it Mike? What plans?
11 Feb 17:27 - Mike Prime: Heading home soon, will be back about 7ish?
11 Feb 17:31 - Tegan: Fun. I fancy a film and a beer. Compliance?
11 Feb 17:55 - Mike Prime: I'll allow it
11 Feb 17:56 - Mike Prime: We have HIV cowboy film
11 Feb 17:58 - Sam Roberts: I love your film choices. There's one just come out about a going French girl who falls through different levels of degradation and sexual experimentation
11 Feb 17:58 - Sam Roberts: It sounds like the blackest of black comedies, it made me think of you
11 Feb 18:01 - Sam Roberts: Ooh also there's a new cirque de soleil thing I want to go to if anyone's up for it
11 Feb 18:02 - Sam Roberts: And Robocop!
11 Feb 18:05 - Shaggy: I don't think quidam is new, although their names all sound weirdly samey
11 Feb 20:54 - Bongo: Sam that film you described just sounds like porn.
11 Feb 21:02 - Mike Prime: Nymphomaniac?
11 Feb 21:03 - Mike Prime: Hear you see shia le buif shagging for real
11 Feb 21:03 - Mike Prime: Shabby la bleef whatever his name is
11 Feb 21:23 - Sam Roberts: Yeah that one! Yeah kind of porny! Apparently you actually see almost nothing though
11 Feb 21:24 - Sam Roberts: Did not not shim sham la beef was in it though, pretty sure I don't want to see his junk
11 Feb 22:39 - Owen: A warning: that film is by lars von trier, his previous films have included a woman cutting off her own genitalia. He is FUCKED UP. So I doubt it will be what you are expecting.
13 Feb 10:21 - Hannah: Happy bunnday!!!!!
13 Feb 10:22 - Shaggy: <Media omitted>
13 Feb 10:28 - Owen: Happy birthday Bunndamental particle.

13 Feb 11:37 - Bunn: Drinks then food
13 Feb 11:37 - Bunn: Drinks at Roadtrip? Or Bedroom bar? Eat somewhere in shoreditch?
13 Feb 11:38 - Bunn: Was thinking chico bandito
13 Feb 11:38 - Bunn: Cos i'm a cheeky bandit
13 Feb 11:38 - Shaggy: Barely a Chico though
13 Feb 11:39 - Shaggy: Woo I just renewed information governance certificate, all hail
13 Feb 12:04 - Hannah: Quickly off topic - who wants to see the Lego movie
13 Feb 12:13 - Eliza Bott: ÓÅóÓåêüêá

13 Feb 12:17 - Phil 2: Happy birthentagschloten
13 Feb 12:18 - Shaggy: Yay for Lego movie
13 Feb 12:20 - Mike Prime: Lego = very yes
13 Feb 12:30 - Owen: More on my new game. It is called "cold war conundrum"
13 Feb 12:32 - Owen: Also, shaggy, can you add dan to this group please?
13 Feb 18:04 - Dave Mendes da Costa: ‚Ä™+44 7545 989149‚Ä¨ joined
13 Feb 15:17 - Owen: The game is coming together.  I have written all the rules. Which weekends are people free?
13 Feb 15:19 - Owen: Btw dan. I have made a new game, a bit like the demon game but shorter and with more spies and moles and tailing and scavenger hunting. It is called cold war conundrum!
13 Feb 15:19 - ‚Ä™+44 7545 989149‚Ä¨: Eeeeexcellent...
13 Feb 15:20 - Owen: Can I email you the rules and get your input before sharing with everyone. You were a great help with the demon game.
13 Feb 15:21 - Owen: Are you danruddick@hotmail.com?
13 Feb 15:32 - Owen: Hey in fact Bunn would you like to do this for your birthday? Part of the game is that it ends up in a pub anyway! A pub in which we could have pub lunch...
13 Feb 15:54 - Shaggy: I don't see this happening on Sunday
13 Feb 15:55 - Owen: Saturday?
13 Feb 15:55 - Owen: Whats happening tonight by the way?
13 Feb 16:02 - Shaggy: Depends. I'd like to slack around and see the Lego movie Saturday, also depends on the weather surely?
13 Feb 16:02 - ‚Ä™+44 7545 989149‚Ä¨: That's me. Send em through...
13 Feb 16:02 - Owen: Already done dan.
13 Feb 16:03 - Sam Roberts: Food and drinks Shoreditch way, when bunny decides where's cool enough!
13 Feb 16:09 - Eliza Bott: Yeah, you definitely don't want to play the spy game in wet or windy weather.
13 Feb 16:26 - Owen: The spy game is so good by the way!
13 Feb 16:26 - Owen: I haven't played it yet.  But I think it is better than the demon game.
13 Feb 16:27 - Shaggy: Gaming banter in gaming group please
13 Feb 16:27 - Owen: This isn't gaming banter. This is for everyone.
13 Feb 16:28 - Shaggy: Spy GAME
13 Feb 16:28 - Owen: Except Sarah. She did not like the demon game.
13 Feb 16:29 - Owen: Yeah but shaggy this is not a video game. This is a game that hopefully everyone will play.
13 Feb 16:30 - Owen: Also "cold war conundrum" does not contain the word "spy"
13 Feb 16:30 - Owen: Or the word "game"
13 Feb 16:30 - Shaggy: You called it the spy game
13 Feb 16:31 - Owen: Ok what topics are allowed in this group then baas?
13 Feb 16:32 - Shaggy: Just banter
13 Feb 17:17 - Tegan: Happy birthday,  Bunn! What time should I be heading to shoreditch?

5 Mar 10:55 - Mike Prime: There's vue, but its 3d at 8. Not sure you can do orange weds with 3d
5 Mar 11:11 - Mike Prime: Think 6.40 at west India quay is the best we can do
5 Mar 11:16 - Tegan: Thats quite early
5 Mar 11:18 - Mike Prime: Yup
5 Mar 11:18 - Mike Prime: It is a kids film tho, can't find later except the expensive vue one
5 Mar 11:33 - Mike Prime: On the other hand probably wana eat. I looked and orange weds is cheaper for 3d but not half price. Think it will be like ¬£6 each
5 Mar 11:55 - Martha: I can have a look for something more central (+ a bit later +not 3d) over lunch
5 Mar 13:01 - Tegan: It's probably not very long- we can always eat after

6 Mar 18:08 - Tegan: Not in a Lego movie it ain't
6 Mar 18:10 - ‚Ä™+44 7944 609055‚Ä¨: As if they'd make a film about lego Teegs, honestly. ;)

9 Mar 09:36 - Owen: One o clock it is. What are we doing? Is there some kind of barbecue at bongos or something?
9 Mar 09:37 - Tegan: Bongo was suggesting barbeque- I believe he had the will but not the outside space
9 Mar 09:41 - Tegan: Fancy hitting a museum/park then hooking up with everyone to hear their awesome yarns?
9 Mar 09:42 - Tegan: Apparently regents park has a sculpture park
9 Mar 09:57 - Tegan: Sugges
9 Mar 09:57 - Tegan: tions?
9 Mar 10:18 - Owen: These sound like good plans. Maybe we could get some beerskis and picnic food for regents park.
9 Mar 10:57 - Alan: I'm going to do a few more hours revision then head out to meet you all early afternoon. Probably at about 2 or 3.
9 Mar 11:00 - Tegan: Sounds good y'all
9 Mar 11:40 - Owen: Where are we meeting?
9 Mar 11:44 - Sam Roberts: Shaggys found a nice pub lunch pub near hackney wick, I think we're cycling over there for about 2, after bloody Mary o'clock, y'all fancy joining for tasty snacks and tall tales?
9 Mar 11:45 - Shaggy: It was Vanessa's idea but I take all credit
9 Mar 11:48 - Sam Roberts: If you guys are gallerying first, at the pub after I guess? You got a favourite one team Shag V?

9 Mar 12:03 - Eliza Bott: Sounds good. See you then/there.
9 Mar 12:16 - Hannah: So are some people hackney wick pub whilst others are regents park?

9 Mar 12:16 - Hannah: Dumbfounded
9 Mar 12:16 - Hannah: Astounded
9 Mar 12:16 - Shaggy: Yes, to prevent overcrowding
9 Mar 12:22 - Shaggy: I think regents park sounds like a winner
9 Mar 12:26 - Hannah: So all to regents park?
9 Mar 12:34 - Sam Roberts: Shure, for about 3? And maybe pub after? There's been a dearth of good pubs in the last two weeks. Stupid India, having to drink in palaces instead
9 Mar 13:11 - Alan: Will see you there
9 Mar 13:41 - Tegan: Whoop! I love it when a plan comes together
9 Mar 13:41 - Tegan: Good work Hannah
9 Mar 13:42 - Tegan: There's some charming pubs around primrose hill.  And chalk farm/camden is just down the road

9 Mar 18:10 - Sam Roberts: Get a man with a van, it costs about twenty quid more than renting one and so much less hassle it's a joke
9 Mar 18:10 - Sam Roberts: I'll be around to help move stuff around if you need, it's on my cv under life skills x
9 Mar 18:13 - Phil 2: I can carry posters like a borse. Up stairs, along corridors, up different stairs. Basically any combination of posters and schlepping I excel at.
9 Mar 18:17 - Cate: Thanks guys :)
9 Mar 19:55 - Mike Prime: Borse = bavarian horse?
9 Mar 19:56 - Owen: Date? Is it a weekend? I will help carry if it is.

9 Mar 20:00 - Alan: I can drive a car / van to/from bristol in a day. But don't have one. If anyone knows someone in London with a big car I can borrow than we can do it. How much stuff you moving?
9 Mar 21:45 - Cate: It's not much stuff, no furniture, just too much stuff for a person to carry. And a fish. Moving day is any day between now and 2nd April, if I can find / hire a car would you really drive it here and back to London Alan?
9 Mar 21:53 - Alan: Sure I will. Car needs to live in London though...
9 Mar 21:53 - Alan: If that isn't obvious

12 Mar 18:30 - Tegan: Cheers
12 Mar 18:34 - Shaggy: Late parrot
12 Mar 18:41 - Mike Prime: That reminds me : google 'hatebeak'
12 Mar 18:47 - Shaggy: It pretty fly
12 Mar 18:48 - Vanessa: Bongo you're wrong, it's going to be glorious weather
12 Mar 18:48 - Bongo: @tegs game on for lunch, I'll ping you in the morning
12 Mar 18:49 - Bongo: They may say it's going to be sunny
12 Mar 18:49 - Vanessa: Is that meant to be a nuance?
12 Mar 18:49 - Bongo: But I bet my monkey's uncle it's going to be cold and depressing
12 Mar 18:50 - Vanessa: You don't have a monkey so you can't bet that
12 Mar 18:50 - Tegan: Dibs on bongo's monkey uncle
12 Mar 18:50 - Tegan: Sorry
12 Mar 18:50 - Bongo: They may say I don't have a monkey
12 Mar 18:50 - Tegan: Monkey's uncle
12 Mar 18:51 - Vanessa: Nah still can't make a bet on that
12 Mar 18:51 - Bongo: Who's going to stop me?
12 Mar 18:51 - Vanessa: Me
12 Mar 18:51 - Vanessa: Phil don't listen to bongo's weather pessimism.  It's going to be glorious
12 Mar 18:52 - Bongo: Don't listen to her Phil, listen to my hairy uncle
12 Mar 18:53 - Tegan: Slam, how was the j'interview?
12 Mar 18:54 - Mike Prime: bongo : mixing idioms like water off a camels back
12 Mar 18:55 - Tegan: It'll take more than two stones to get that camel through the eye of the beerholder
12 Mar 18:55 - Tegan: As bongo would say
12 Mar 18:56 - Bongo: Well said young grass hopper
12 Mar 18:57 - Tegan: Beer somewhere anyone?
12 Mar 18:58 - Bongo: Where are ye?
12 Mar 18:59 - Bongo: I could go for a quick one
12 Mar 18:59 - Tegan: At work still
12 Mar 18:59 - Tegan: I'm just giving a few minutes to Wills
12 Mar 19:00 - Bongo: I'm just leaving, could meet at that place on the corner
12 Mar 19:00 - Bongo: Prince something?
12 Mar 19:00 - Sam Roberts: I'm going to get drunk somewhere. Probably at that salsa bar, so I can swear at elegant people. Y'all welcome to join, but I won't tolerate joviality, frivolity or any other kind of monkey business
12 Mar 19:01 - Mike Prime: That badly huh?
12 Mar 19:03 - Tegan: 10 mins?
12 Mar 19:04 - Bongo: Aight
12 Mar 19:04 - Bongo: I'm pretty much there now
12 Mar 19:04 - Bongo: Or are you talking to Sam?
12 Mar 19:05 - Sam Roberts: Actually really well, which had made me maudlin. Seems like I'm better at everything when I'm too hungover to stand up  by myself
12 Mar 19:06 - Bongo: Your vocab's gone out the hatch too
12 Mar 19:11 - Sam Roberts: I'll batten down my bellyaching
12 Mar 19:12 - Sam Roberts: You guys drinking around Blackfriars somewhere? Might pop over in a bit
12 Mar 19:13 - Tegan: Yeah m
12 Mar 19:13 - Tegan: In the albino
12 Mar 19:14 - Tegan: Albion
12 Mar 19:15 - Bongo: Yea I'm in there now
12 Mar 19:16 - Bongo: Hungover interviews are a tricky one
12 Mar 19:18 - Bongo: I never know whether it went really well because I was still drunk
12 Mar 19:18 - Bongo: But in retrospect they all went really well so I reckon we're onto something
12 Mar 20:38 - Dave Mendes da Costa: Anyone at c town? X
12 Mar 20:39 - Shaggy: Not for a few hours
12 Mar 20:44 - Dave Mendes da Costa: Good lord
12 Mar 21:11 - Shaggy: I'm leaving work shortly, so will actually be home around 10
12 Mar 21:12 - Dave Mendes da Costa: Criminy. Too long at work dude. I though you were out getting your freak on.
13 Mar 12:32 - Shaggy: The cannon is charging:
13 Mar 12:32 - Shaggy: <Media omitted>
13 Mar 16:06 - Tegan: Jiminy whillickers, Batshag!
13 Mar 16:10 - Owen: Batshag... ewwww

13 Mar 16:23 - Mike Prime: Bats need lovin too
13 Mar 17:40 - Tegan: Phil- is some kind of feast on offer this evening?
13 Mar 17:53 - Dave Mendes da Costa: Second
13 Mar 18:41 - Bongo: Lol he's only just got back and you're asking him to cook
13 Mar 18:42 - Shaggy: He's had a month holiday!
13 Mar 18:58 - Tegan: Second
13 Mar 19:23 - Sam Roberts: The Phil requests some wine for the cooking, and also for his face
13 Mar 19:24 - Sam Roberts: I guess I've been designated his whatsapp interpreter
13 Mar 19:34 - Tegan: On my way back,  wineladen
13 Mar 19:38 - Vanessa: I'm having a beer while I'm working #livingontheedge haha
13 Mar 19:39 - Dave Mendes da Costa: Woot to both
13 Mar 19:42 - Shaggy: I don't like that goats cheese or the garlicky one
13 Mar 19:47 - Vanessa: Noted for next time
13 Mar 19:50 - Tegan: General wooting
13 Mar 19:50 - Tegan: Also-I'm probably going to be an hour- does that fit in with Phil's plans, Slam?
13 Mar 19:51 - Dave Mendes da Costa: It does wigs. Xx
13 Mar 19:53 - Tegan: Schwert
13 Mar 19:53 - Tegan: X
13 Mar 20:00 - Sam Roberts: I love that goats cheese, don't listen to the man
13 Mar 21:52 - Bongo: Noooo
13 Mar 21:53 - Bongo: Sorry I meant boooo
13 Mar 21:54 - Bongo: Goats cheese was in all the Indian cirrus
13 Mar 21:54 - Bongo: *currys

13 Mar 21:55 - Dave Mendes da Costa: You need to delete the feed from your list. Sorry to see you go though. Xx
13 Mar 22:13 - Sam Roberts: That was dogs cheese dude, goats cheese is fine
13 Mar 22:15 - Shaggy: Paneer baby yeeeaahhhh

14 Mar 00:04 - Tegan: <Media omitted>
14 Mar 00:04 - Tegan: Awwww
14 Mar 00:42 - ‚Ä™+61 405 567 873‚Ä¨: :(
14 Mar 08:28 - Mike Prime: I'm gonna give this hangover a 9/10
14 Mar 08:29 - Bongo: Is that good or bad?
14 Mar 08:32 - Shaggy: <Media omitted>
14 Mar 08:32 - Shaggy: Can't even see the end of the road
14 Mar 09:05 - Mike Prime: @bongo: the only thing keeping me awake is the pain
14 Mar 09:06 - ‚Ä™+61 405 567 873‚Ä¨: Bongo is awake ?
14 Mar 09:06 - ‚Ä™+61 405 567 873‚Ä¨: Bongo sleeps while he's standing up .....
14 Mar 09:07 - ‚Ä™+61 405 567 873‚Ä¨: Im still here , having computer illiterate troubles leaving thiis convo :p
14 Mar 09:23 - Shaggy: Why are you trying to leave, you prawn?
14 Mar 09:26 - Sam Roberts: I felt like the cycling dead this morning, apocalyptic hangover
14 Mar 09:26 - Shaggy: Haha I feel fine now, I guess I'm made of sterner stuff
14 Mar 09:28 - Tegan: If you hit the settings buttom on your phone, you can leave groups through the 'group info' tab
14 Mar 09:28 - Tegan: It was fleeting, wagg. But it was sweet
14 Mar 09:42 - ‚Ä™+61 405 567 873‚Ä¨: :p
14 Mar 11:39 - Bongo: @shag sounds like you're still drunk mate, good luck surviving the afternoon
14 Mar 11:40 - Shaggy: I feel great now, actually! And in a great mood too
14 Mar 13:06 - Owen: What were all of you doing last night? And why would you get that smashed on a weekday night. Hangovers on Sunday are fine. A work day hangover is terrible. I did not enjoy Monday.
14 Mar 13:27 - Dave Mendes da Costa: Phil returned with schnaps and then went on a beer run. Of would have been rude not to drink!
14 Mar 13:25 - Shaggy: That's because you're a wuss

14 Mar 17:26 - Dave Mendes da Costa: Why do a thing like that?
14 Mar 17:41 - Mike Prime: Cause no point going ctown and back out again
14 Mar 17:42 - Mike Prime: Rather get my reddit on for a bit
14 Mar 17:42 - Dave Mendes da Costa: Owen changed the subject to ‚ÄúAnyone can change subject‚Äù
14 Mar 17:46 - Tegan: I'm in a bar in haggerston of you care to join
14 Mar 17:46 - Tegan: Canal side, nice aspect
14 Mar 17:49 - Mike Prime: Ite, gona be bout an hour tho
14 Mar 17:53 - Tegan: I'm working for now, so I'm here for the long haul- no point in leaving as it's so close to islington
14 Mar 18:35 - Sam Roberts: I'm having a quick one in all bar one, Moorgate if anyone's passing by, we all up there for 8 otherwise?
14 Mar 18:43 - Tegan: location: https://maps.google.com/?q=51.5367737,-0.0784776
14 Mar 18:43 - Tegan: Wills and I are here
14 Mar 18:45 - Mike Prime: I'm heading moorgate cause there's a direct train
14 Mar 19:04 - Owen: We might be late. we missed our train and there are delays on northern line.
14 Mar 19:16 - Vanessa: Does anyone have an iPhone 5 cable I could borrow over the weekend?
14 Mar 19:17 - Vanessa: It's the same one used for the iPad mini
14 Mar 19:27 - Shaggy: Don't have either of those things
14 Mar 19:41 - Mike Prime: I made an awesome graph today
14 Mar 19:41 - Mike Prime: The house numbers of properties sold in the last year. Spot the odd one out...
14 Mar 19:41 - Mike Prime: <Media omitted>
14 Mar 19:47 - Owen: 1!
14 Mar 19:47 - Owen: And 13.
14 Mar 19:47 - Owen: But I'm more interested in 1.
14 Mar 19:48 - Owen: My initial thoughts were that if you had the only house on a street you wouldn't number it, you would name it.
14 Mar 19:49 - Owen: Then I realised that surely for every house number 2 there would be a number 1 so they should at least be equal.
14 Mar 19:51 - Owen: I come to the conclusion that if you own house 1 you are less likely to sell. I have yet to figure out why.
14 Mar 21:23 - Bongo: Reminds me of benford's law, that one's pretty messed up
14 Mar 21:24 - Owen: Benfords law?
14 Mar 22:13 - Sam Roberts: You mean more likely to sell
14 Mar 22:15 - Owen: 22:15
14 Mar 22:26 - Mike Prime: Benfords law is where loads more statistics start with a 1 because they're exponentially distributed, eg longest rivers, CEO salaries etc
15 Mar 00:30 - Shaggy: <Media omitted>
15 Mar 00:32 - Owen: Oh. Yeah I knew about that, didn't know it was called benfords law. That why I was surprised by the fact that there were fewer 1s than 2s.
15 Mar 00:32 - Owen: Night  night now.  Owen sleeps.
15 Mar 00:52 - Shaggy: It's called "drink me". Unlike other cocktails they don't mix it, but just take out of the fridge, and give you a shot of apple juice in case it's too strong. It's not very tasty despite all the effort
15 Mar 11:20 - Bongo: Who's up for a partaay, I need something to keep my attention or I'm going to fall asleep
15 Mar 11:47 - Shaggy: Going to see Lego movie now. Pub later?
15 Mar 11:58 - Bongo: Game on
15 Mar 11:58 - Bongo: When does the movie finish?
15 Mar 11:58 - Bongo: Also - really want to see that
15 Mar 12:05 - Shaggy: Starts at 12:40, so probably around 14:30
15 Mar 12:10 - Bongo: Canary wharf?
15 Mar 12:32 - Shaggy: Hackney
15 Mar 12:33 - Bongo: Imma pop round ctown then
15 Mar 12:34 - Shaggy: There's a big lebowski quote along in prince Charles cinema tonight
15 Mar 12:38 - Bongo: Lol sounds good
15 Mar 12:39 - Owen: Lol? Shaggy just stated a fact why did you lol?
15 Mar 12:43 - Bongo: The fact made me laugh
15 Mar 12:45 - Shaggy: I didn't realise the grand Budapest hotel was the new wes Anderson film, I really want to see it!
15 Mar 12:48 - Owen: It was good.
15 Mar 13:19 - Bongo: Just witnessed a pidgeon swallow a cigarette butt
15 Mar 13:19 - Bongo: Nearly vommed
15 Mar 13:21 - Bongo: Ctown never fails to surprise
15 Mar 14:32 - Shaggy: You or the pidgeon?
15 Mar 15:09 - Bongo: Me
15 Mar 15:10 - Bongo: Pidge probably had the best meal in a week
15 Mar 15:42 - Martha: Hola hombres!! Brunch funday tomorrow at mine starting at midday? Blueberry pancakes etc. followed by board games and/or frisbee in the local park. Bring fruit, bacon, sausages, and perhaps the odd extra maple syrup &/ whatever else you might fancy. Mmm? Xxx
15 Mar 15:43 - Shaggy: I bought a new deck of phase 10!
15 Mar 15:59 - Bongo: I'll bring all that shit and more Marth
15 Mar 15:59 - Bongo: What time are we talking?
15 Mar 16:04 - Shaggy: What time is lebowski thing tonight?
15 Mar 16:04 - Bongo: No brunch tomorrow
15 Mar 16:04 - Bongo: Elbow ski is 9 or something isn't it?
15 Mar 16:05 - Shaggy: Brunch starts midday
15 Mar 16:06 - Bongo: Midday is subjective
15 Mar 16:07 - Bongo: I was hoping she'd give a time so that we could be 2 hours late
15 Mar 16:20 - Martha: Indeed, 12 midday. Rock up whenever, the only risk is that we'll have eaten all the pancakes innit. Yay phase 10!
15 Mar 18:30 - Vanessa: I'm in for the movie. I'm just charging my phone at the apple shop. Where is everyone?
15 Mar 18:30 - Vanessa: @martha not sure I can make it tomorrow. My brother is in town and wants to hang out
15 Mar 18:40 - Owen: Martha. I am going to be playing catan with xav all day!

15 Mar 20:22 - Alan: Catan sounds like an awesome way to spend a Sunday. I've got the 5-6 player expansion if that helps?
15 Mar 20:30 - Owen: I think xav already has it. However we could make 8 player catan with a second expansion.
15 Mar 20:32 - Bunn: Nerds
15 Mar 20:33 - Bunn: ;)
15 Mar 20:51 - Mike Prime: I'm a nerd and I don't even know what this is anymore
15 Mar 20:58 - Bunn: Haha!
15 Mar 20:58 - Bunn: I'm on the train back to Ctown now
15 Mar 20:59 - Bunn: Should be back in about an hour
15 Mar 21:33 - Alan: 8 player catan would be truly epic
15 Mar 21:52 - Shaggy: Looks like civ without a computer, I'm in http://www.catan.com
15 Mar 22:29 - Dave Mendes da Costa: Bunn, I'm afraid I've left some bits on your room. Sorry for the mess. Xx
15 Mar 22:48 - Bunn: S'all good brotha

16 Mar 12:42 - Bongo: Eta 40 mins?
16 Mar 12:49 - Shaggy: I'll be about an hour, leave me a bite of something! What materials are still required?
16 Mar 12:57 - Tegan: Yeah, what can we bring ?
16 Mar 12:58 - Martha: We're good for pancakes, I have eggs, and we even have a few sausages. Maybe Prosecco and juice??
16 Mar 12:58 - Martha: Scratch the maybe.
16 Mar 12:59 - Shaggy: Ooo Buck's Fizz
16 Mar 13:27 - Alan: Martha - where abouts are you based? Gonna start cycling soon.
16 Mar 13:28 - Martha: Round the corner from barbican EC1Y 0SP (v close to look mum no hands)
16 Mar 13:29 - Martha: Old lofts flat D, 10 crescent row

16 Mar 16:16 - Shaggy: location: https://maps.google.com/?q=51.53269,-0.067693
16 Mar 16:19 - Mike Prime: Bikes means right
18 Mar 10:53 - Tegan: <Media omitted>
18 Mar 10:53 - Tegan: Work problem
18 Mar 10:54 - Tegan: Trying to import csv data into postgres- tried changing postgres encoding- do I need to do something to the csv file?
18 Mar 10:55 - Tegan: Answers on a postcard please
18 Mar 10:56 - Shaggy: What encoding does csv have? Looks like it's in some sort of byte code, or whatever you're importing it into converts it to some weird byte code
18 Mar 10:56 - Tegan: How would I go about finding out about the byte code?
18 Mar 10:57 - Shaggy: Can you open and read csv in notepad?
18 Mar 11:01 - Tegan: This is where my basic lack of computing ability comes into the fore! I will try
18 Mar 11:02 - Tegan: Yes I can!
18 Mar 11:04 - Owen: It stands for comma seperated values. Its a really simple ascii encoding.  Each comma means a new cell and two commas means a new row.
18 Mar 11:04 - Dave Mendes da Costa: Bunn changed the subject to ‚ÄúIT Support‚Äù
18 Mar 11:06 - Dave Mendes da Costa: Shaggy changed the subject to ‚ÄúExpert CS think tank‚Äù
18 Mar 11:05 - Shaggy: So then Postgres is trying to read more into than required
18 Mar 11:06 - Shaggy: Do you have any import options?
18 Mar 11:06 - Tegan: Sorry bunny, won't take long I'm sure- but asking these guys seemed like so much of a better option than asking the in house it support, who would spit at me and tell me they could do it next week
18 Mar 11:06 - Owen: Probably. What program generated your csv file teegs?
18 Mar 11:06 - Bunn: Haha. I was making a joke!
18 Mar 11:07 - Tegan: I have some:
18 Mar 11:07 - Owen: ???
18 Mar 11:08 - Tegan: <Media omitted>
18 Mar 11:08 - Tegan: Sad to it was excel, O
18 Mar 11:08 - Owen: That should work
18 Mar 11:08 - Tegan: (You guys are heroes)
18 Mar 11:08 - Owen: I'm not sure how it will handle row delimeters though
18 Mar 11:09 - Owen: I don't know or use postges. I just have used csvs a lot in the past.
18 Mar 11:09 - Tegan: I did the same process with another excel csv and it worked a charm
18 Mar 11:09 - Owen: Cool.
18 Mar 11:09 - Owen: So no problem anymore?
18 Mar 11:09 - Tegan: No, there is a problem with this one
18 Mar 11:10 - Shaggy: Go to file options
18 Mar 11:11 - Tegan: <Media omitted>
18 Mar 11:11 - Shaggy: Encoding empty?
18 Mar 11:11 - Owen: Utf8
18 Mar 11:11 - Owen: That should work.
18 Mar 11:12 - Shaggy: Clearly not UTF8 given the error
18 Mar 11:12 - Owen: I am pretty sure csvs are utf8
18 Mar 11:12 - Owen: Oh yeah.
18 Mar 11:12 - Owen: Odd.
18 Mar 11:13 - Shaggy: Can you export csv again?
18 Mar 11:13 - Tegan: The file is in French so contains accents- looking at
Stackoverflow etc I thought that might be messing stuff up...?
18 Mar 11:13 - Mike Prime: The error looks like it was missing the commas
18 Mar 11:13 - Shaggy: So probably IS in UTF8
18 Mar 11:14 - Tegan: Looking at it in notepad there aren't any commas around null values
18 Mar 11:14 - Owen: Open it in excel and then save with a known encoding.
18 Mar 11:15 - Shaggy: Go to null options
18 Mar 11:15 - Owen: There wouldn't be.
18 Mar 11:17 - Tegan: <Media omitted>
18 Mar 11:18 - Shaggy: How is null shown in csv?
18 Mar 11:18 - Owen: Depends. Normally just blank , , sometimes , "",
18 Mar 11:18 - Tegan: <Media omitted>
18 Mar 11:19 - Tegan: Blank here
18 Mar 11:19 - Owen: Yeah
18 Mar 11:19 - Shaggy: That's fine. You have a header in file though and it's not ticked in misc options
18 Mar 11:19 - Tegan: Don't worry, it's not very confidential
18 Mar 11:20 - Tegan: So header file ticked and utf8 encoding?
18 Mar 11:21 - Shaggy: Encoding should be detected automatically. It's could also be UTF16 or some other numbers, try with it blank doff auto detection
18 Mar 11:21 - Tegan: Both give the same error as before
18 Mar 11:22 - Owen: What is on trans_customer line 2?
18 Mar 11:23 - Owen: You might have an invalid charcter or something?
18 Mar 11:24 - Tegan: Trans_customer is the table I'm importing into... so there's nothing there yet...
18 Mar 11:24 - Owen: is that the whole table or one of the headings?
18 Mar 11:25 - Tegan: I'll check my table defs
18 Mar 11:25 - Tegan: Whole table
18 Mar 11:25 - Mike Prime: Do any of your columns have commas in them?
18 Mar 11:25 - Mike Prime: To be safe you should put quotes around strings when you save them to csv
18 Mar 11:26 - Shaggy: Excel will do that for you
18 Mar 11:26 - Tegan: Good point- some of the character ones do. .. I don't know if it's got as far as reading those though
18 Mar 11:26 - Tegan: Ok
18 Mar 11:26 - Shaggy: Trying playing around with the encoding in file options
18 Mar 11:26 - Shaggy: Try*
18 Mar 11:27 - Owen: Not always shaggy.  It's an option. An option that it doesn't look like it was ticked judging by the notepad screenshot.
18 Mar 11:27 - Tegan: Good detdctive work y'all- would I do that when I save?
18 Mar 11:28 - Shaggy: Not on my excel, maybe yours is rustic
18 Mar 11:28 - Owen: Try reexporting your csv from excel teegs. Choose a known haracter encoding and tick whatever option it is to put inverted commas around strings. It might be called encapsulate strings.
18 Mar 11:29 - Tegan: Ok,  I'm hoping to have a play
18 Mar 11:30 - Owen: Oh you are right. Excel 2010 doesn't have that.
18 Mar 11:30 - Tegan: I am in office 13, and I don't seem to have options when I export
18 Mar 11:31 - Tegan: Stoopid microsoft taking away my autonomy
18 Mar 11:32 - Owen: Hmm. I just tried it out and shaggy is right. On newer versions of excel it automatically adds " where necessary.
18 Mar 11:32 - Tegan: Oh. Then clever Microsoft.
18 Mar 11:52 - Tegan: Thanks anyway guys-I'll owe you a pint for the half hour of work time I just stole from you
18 Mar 11:53 - Owen: Im home ill anyway.
18 Mar 11:54 - Tegan: Poor owen. Feel better
18 Mar 12:14 - Shaggy: Bring me some first class champagne on your way back
18 Mar 12:14 - Dave Mendes da Costa: Shaggy changed the subject to ‚ÄúThe horde‚Äù
18 Mar 12:53 - Hannah: Guys this has not been horde material
18 Mar 12:54 - Hannah: The horde has strict regulations
18 Mar 12:56 - Hannah: Tits and beer only please guys

18 Mar 13:33 - Shaggy: The horror on her face
18 Mar 16:32 - Tegan: Sorry Hannah- in future I will open up another link for my database needs
18 Mar 16:33 - Tegan: #humbled
18 Mar 17:08 - Hannah: No worries teegs - I was just expressing my disappointment when I saw I had 83 whatsapp messages that unfortunately they were not pictures of boobies
18 Mar 17:08 - Hannah: Or a prolonged game of bum or elbow
18 Mar 18:01 - Shaggy: #technophobe
18 Mar 18:05 - Bongo: Aww yeaaaaaaa normalise my tables
18 Mar 18:05 - Bongo: Nerds
18 Mar 18:12 - Bongo: Albion anyone?
18 Mar 18:14 - Tegan: No can do, bruva- I'm offski
18 Mar 18:15 - Dave Mendes da Costa: How goes your leaving Tegs? Did you recover your passport? X
18 Mar 19:09 - Tegan: Passport recovered, leaving underway. I have once again arrived at Heathrow early to find that there is nothing in my pay bracket to distract me.  Grue. Still, dinner on its way- let the expensing commence! X
18 Mar 19:10 - Shaggy: Wait what? You didn't fly yesterday?
18 Mar 19:11 - Tegan: My passport was in Belgium! Fail. But all sorted now.
18 Mar 19:11 - Tegan: Tonight we fly
18 Mar 19:11 - Shaggy: Why?
18 Mar 19:12 - Tegan: I'm going to Mali after I'm done in Tanzania, for which I belatedly realised I needed a visa. Their closest embassy is in Belgium, so I sent my passport of last week... But failed to book a return courier
18 Mar 19:13 - Tegan: #businessnoob

19 Mar 14:03 - Tegan: On my way, captain!
19 Mar 14:05 - Sam Roberts: Is that what heaven looks like?
19 Mar 17:30 - Phil 2: Not enough Dark Souls
19 Mar 17:37 - Shaggy: Are you so bored you checked your phone?
20 Mar 17:13 - Dave Mendes da Costa: Anything happening tonight? I want to do something.
20 Mar 17:45 - Bunn: Home.food.sleep.mmmmm
20 Mar 17:46 - Sam Roberts: Mmmmmmmm
20 Mar 17:51 - Dave Mendes da Costa: Aight. I'm off to explore the docklands. See you later. X
20 Mar 17:54 - Shaggy: Office party!!! I'm busy for the next two hours, then it's open for all. We're near borough
20 Mar 17:57 - Bunn: Open bar?
20 Mar 18:31 - Mike Prime: Anyone wana go borough? Dave? I can but I've got like an hour to kill
20 Mar 18:33 - Dave Mendes da Costa: I'm on a strange walk to canning town. Lost my energy for the night. Unless its a free bar.
20 Mar 18:36 - Mike Prime: K nm then, see you at home
20 Mar 18:45 - Bongo: Dave losing energy made me really sad for some reason
20 Mar 18:46 - Bongo: I order you to have a redbull
20 Mar 18:53 - Dave Mendes da Costa: Yes sir! X
21 Mar 08:40 - Dave Mendes da Costa: Happy Friday everybody! X
21 Mar 09:20 - Sam Roberts: Happy Friday Dave!
21 Mar 09:20 - Sam Roberts: May it be be a rolling crescendo from tea to party
21 Mar 09:22 - Sam Roberts: Speaking of which, there's no red fang tickets left, you think I would have learnt to book in advance by now... anyone got some other fun to join? Or fancy a good old fashioned pub session if not?
21 Mar 09:52 - Bunn: Booo. Tout?
21 Mar 09:54 - Bongo: Old fashioned pub sesh sounds good
21 Mar 10:58 - Phil 2: Gonna hit up some art with beast then join yall for boozing.
21 Mar 11:21 - Sam Roberts: Could try a tout, there's a couple of nice places to drink in Camden if that falls through right?
21 Mar 11:22 - Sam Roberts: I didn't realise how massive the world's end is! I think we stayed in the front bit last time, I thought it was a pokey little place
21 Mar 11:38 - Dave Mendes da Costa: Tout?
21 Mar 11:40 - Mike Prime: Ticket tout for red fang
21 Mar 11:45 - Dave Mendes da Costa: Aha. It all make sense now.
21 Mar 11:47 - Mike Prime: Yeah I thought Bunn was suggesting a French restaurant at first
21 Mar 11:55 - Bunn: Mange tout?
21 Mar 12:39 - Bongo: You could try touting to start off, I'm going to be out latish
21 Mar 12:39 - Bongo: Like, 7/8
21 Mar 21:01 - Bunn: Cate got the job!!
21 Mar 21:02 - Tegan: Whoop!
21 Mar 21:03 - Vanessa: ÓåíÓåíÓåíüéäüéäüéä
21 Mar 21:03 - ‚Ä™+44 7935 737878‚Ä¨: Wooo! Well done Cate!
21 Mar 21:03 - ‚Ä™+44 7935 737878‚Ä¨: What's the job?
21 Mar 21:04 - Bunn: She had an interview this week and came out thinking it went really badly
21 Mar 21:04 - Bunn: But it turns out she got it!!
21 Mar 21:04 - Bunn: She doesnt reply to whatsapp much
22 Mar 07:36 - Hannah: What is the job
22 Mar 07:55 - Mike Prime: Working for a travel agency, designing holidays I think. Its like her dream job!
22 Mar 08:12 - Hannah: Wooopppp!!!
22 Mar 09:01 - Alan: Now I remember her saying that. That job sounds awesome
22 Mar 16:37 - Tegan: Hanging with my farm boys
22 Mar 16:59 - Tegan: <Media omitted>
22 Mar 17:01 - Dave Mendes da Costa: Nice! Spot the odd one out!

22 Mar 20:04 - Tegan: Respect the swans,  yo
22 Mar 20:04 - Tegan: He can break your neck with a single blow of his nose
22 Mar 20:04 - Tegan: Or something
22 Mar 21:13 - Bongo: That's clearly bullshit
22 Mar 21:14 - Tegan: Yes
22 Mar 21:14 - Bongo: I heard that when I was a kid but never believed it.
22 Mar 21:45 - Sam Roberts: I had a friend who got his arm broken by a goose, wings muscles are no joke
22 Mar 21:49 - Alan: My dog used to keep getting attacked by geese.
22 Mar 23:19 - Sam Roberts: It did well to survive through the first one, they're more dangerous than napalm
22 Mar 23:24 - Mike Prime: That's why the US used to dump flocks of swans all over 'nam. Agent White they called it. Unforgivable.
22 Mar 23:34 - Shaggy: <Media omitted>
22 Mar 23:35 - Shaggy: She's doing wonders for my allergy

23 Mar 16:17 - Cat Thomas: Hujambo teegs!? Where are you right now?
23 Mar 18:29 - Tegan: Poa, my friend- in a beachside hotel in dar es salaam working our little socks off! Back to the field (literally) tomorrow to meet some new farmers
23 Mar 18:30 - Tegan: <Media omitted>
23 Mar 18:30 - Tegan: Look familiar? :)
24 Mar 08:32 - Cat Thomas: Mahindi  mpya mzuri!! Poa!! Fuck teegs, so jealous. The beach in dar is sweet eh!? You gonna get the chance to go anywhere else? I can just imagine you in a dala dala sound system blasting:)
24 Mar 08:49 - Sam Roberts: Any spare ugly duckling tickets going? It's been too long since I came gigging!
24 Mar 08:51 - Mike Prime: Is it sold out?
24 Mar 08:52 - Sam Roberts: Nothing on ticket master, maybe done on the door
24 Mar 09:13 - Mike Prime: Looks like there are some on seetickets? I'd be surprised if it sold out tbh!
24 Mar 09:22 - Sam Roberts: Sweet, nice one dude!
24 Mar 09:22 - Sam Roberts: Drinks first somewhere?
24 Mar 09:40 - Mike Prime: I globbed up, forgot I got printed tickets so I have to go home first. I'll probly be in Camden for 7...
24 Mar 09:41 - Dave Mendes da Costa: What time does it start? We should also move topic to gigs group so Joe Cainey can join in.
24 Mar 10:01 - Sam Roberts: Okie dokie, doors open at 7
24 Mar 12:00 - Hannah: <Media omitted>
24 Mar 12:01 - Bunn: Haha. Thts awesome
24 Mar 12:01 - Bunn: Is that how sausage dogs sit??
24 Mar 13:34 - Owen: The sum of all the natural numbers is equal to (-1/12). This is crazy! Mathematicians arise and explain!
24 Mar 13:37 - Sam Roberts: What do you mean by natural numbers? It usually refers to counting numbers, which you can't sum
24 Mar 13:37 - Owen: 1+2+3+4......
24 Mar 13:38 - Sam Roberts: You can't sum that, you can sum OVER the natural numbers, but you can't add them
24 Mar 13:39 - Owen: Why not?
24 Mar 13:39 - Sam Roberts: Email me whatever you're looking at, before Bunn notices there's maths on the horde
24 Mar 13:40 - Owen: Numberphile sum of natural numbers youtube.
24 Mar 13:46 - Owen: There are two proofs.  One of which uses the reimann zeta function.
24 Mar 13:52 - Mike Prime: Lol, bad horde chat. If you analytically continue the Riemann zeta function and evaluate at -1 that's what you get. Kinda cheating though. As written the series is clearly divergent.
24 Mar 13:58 - Owen: I don't really get what makes a series divegent though. Because 1/1+1/2+1/3 +1/4... is divergent. Even though it feels like it shouldn't be.
24 Mar 13:59 - Owen: Why is it cheating?
24 Mar 14:04 - Mike Prime: This is quite complicated... Zeta(x) is well defined for real x>1. For x<= 1 the series is not convergent. There's a thing called analytic continuation where roughly you find a function which agrees with your function where it is defined and is analytic (read infinitely differentiable) on a compact subset of the complex numbers.
24 Mar 14:06 - Mike Prime: But the analytic continuation is not the same as the original function. So it doesn't make sense to use the series definition of zeta for x<1 and say zeta(-1) = 1+2+3+....
24 Mar 14:10 - Owen: That is what they guy did in the video.  He did zeta(2) and then took away 2.zeta (-2) or something.  I forget exactly how he did it. It feels like cheating.
24 Mar 14:14 - Mike Prime: We should start a nerd horde group or something...
24 Mar 14:15 - Owen: Nah. Let the prols that inhabit this thread learn something.
24 Mar 14:16 - Owen: Also apparently 1-1+1-1+1-1.... is divergent.  Which makes no sense!
24 Mar 14:24 - Dave Mendes da Costa: Well it doesn't converge to anything. Depending on how you cluster the sums it appears it could converge to 0 or 1. In general for an infinite series to be convergent the underlying sequence being summed must converge to zero.
24 Mar 14:26 - Sam Roberts: It's been ages since we've had a pointlessly nerdy argument about something, it's not a much fun sober and writing, let's get drunk and do this again sometime
24 Mar 14:29 - Bunn: Eurgh
24 Mar 14:30 - Bunn: If this was my whatsapp group you'd all be banned by now
24 Mar 14:30 - Shaggy: Hush or I'll ban you
24 Mar 14:30 - Bunn: Please
24 Mar 14:30 - Shaggy: Everyone else, proceed
24 Mar 14:30 - Bunn: I cant take this lack of bants
24 Mar 14:33 - Mike Prime: Your mum is a divergent series Bunn #mathbants
24 Mar 14:35 - Dave Mendes da Costa: Your mum takes zeta(1) and has room for more. #mathslag
24 Mar 14:38 - Shaggy: Your mom's measurements are not even in aleph0 #mathfat
24 Mar 14:44 - Owen: Physicists have finally figured out why the force of gravity is so weak. Bunns mum stole it all!
24 Mar 16:09 - Bunn: Y'all need this
24 Mar 16:10 - Bunn: <Media omitted>
24 Mar 17:17 - Hannah: I agree with Bunn
24 Mar 17:18 - Hannah: If I've told you guys once I've told you a million times - this group is for tits and beer chat

24 Mar 17:43 - Bunn: Is that!?
24 Mar 17:43 - Shaggy: I'll leave that to your imagination
24 Mar 17:47 - Owen: is it for doing elevetated sit ups?
24 Mar 18:02 - Shaggy: No, waterboarding
24 Mar 18:50 - Bunn: Did the clocks go forward at the wknd??

27 Mar 08:38 - Sam Roberts: I've always dreamt of being one of the knife and fork operatives in sector 7g
27 Mar 08:38 - Sam Roberts: Live the dream teeg, nap through the morning

27 Mar 13:58 - Bunn: This sunday yo
27 Mar 16:50 - Martha: For the geeks: www.janthor.com/maze/index.html
27 Mar 16:52 - Tegan: Marth, are you not on the geek group?
27 Mar 16:52 - Tegan: That must be remedied
27 Mar 17:20 - Martha: No I'm not, and not sure whether to be flattered or outraged.
27 Mar 17:22 - Martha: But quite satisfied that I get to flagrantly abuse the 'no geek talk' policy that Bunn and Han have introduced. Vive la revolution!
27 Mar 17:58 - Bunn: Links are fine
27 Mar 18:00 - Hannah: Bunn - we must stand united
27 Mar 18:11 - Dave Mendes da Costa: One of us
One of us

27 Mar 19:44 - Bongo: Probably nothing to do with Kim dotcom bring back in business..
27 Mar 19:44 - Bongo: Probably nothing to do with Kim dotcom being back in business..
27 Mar 20:42 - Hannah: Guys, he'll probably be Óêç but shaggy got another promotion today!ÓåíÓåíÓåíüéäüéäüéäÓåêÓåêÓåêÓÑõÓÑõÓÑõ

28 Mar 10:28 - Tegan: Oops.  Bag recording.
28 Mar 10:39 - Dave Mendes da Costa: Did you record a bag again. That's a bag habit.
28 Mar 10:39 - Shaggy: A haaaaandbbbaaaaaaaaaaag?
28 Mar 10:41 - Shaggy: That recording was just bagging for it
28 Mar 11:10 - Tegan: Just confirming that, as I suspected, there was nothing going on in there
28 Mar 11:10 - Tegan: Nothing at all
28 Mar 11:17 - Sam Roberts: From a one second recording? I think the evidence is inconclusive
28 Mar 11:29 - Shaggy: I think NSA will have more to say about this #terrorists
28 Mar 12:57 - Martha: Indeed, I believe they are currently conducting an investigation in Baghdad
28 Mar 12:58 - Owen: Nice :)
28 Mar 13:00 - Owen: I heard they have plans to place satchel charges in bagdad while they clutch onto their last tope of freedom.
28 Mar 13:00 - Owen: #bagpuns
28 Mar 13:28 - Tegan: Sterling effort, O
28 Mar 13:40 - Owen: Is a sterling a bag?
28 Mar 13:49 - Tegan: No, sorry.  Just genuinely impressed.
28 Mar 13:50 - Tegan: I wrote 'lol' at first
28 Mar 13:50 - Tegan: r
28 Mar 15:02 - Bongo: It's funny how the NSA is the only government department that actually listens to its people
28 Mar 15:19 - Dave Mendes da Costa: Lol
28 Mar 15:25 - Bongo: Where's an awesome place to go on a Saturday in London?
28 Mar 15:28 - Vanessa: What type of awesome are you looking for? Day, night, art, neighbourhoods, etc
28 Mar 15:30 - Sam Roberts: Bongo's got a date!
28 Mar 15:33 - Bunn: Oooooooo

28 Mar 15:44 - Bongo: And less ooooooo
28 Mar 15:48 - Bunn: Canning Town has a nice park
28 Mar 15:52 - Bunn: Not until you tell us who the date is with
28 Mar 15:55 - Eliza Bott: The Grant Museum. It has a jar of moles. Very romantic.
28 Mar 15:56 - Sam Roberts: That place we went for fran's birthday, it's a good mix of classy cocktails and rapey staircases
28 Mar 15:57 - Vanessa: Day walking go to London fields because they have the market and it's a good atmosphere, then walk down to the canal and along the canal towards haggerston. There are a couple of cafes. That's a nice day date
28 Mar 15:59 - Bunn: Canning Town also has some lovely restaurants
28 Mar 16:16 - Hannah: Canning town has some friendly tramps
28 Mar 16:44 - Phil 2: Anywhere you can take your shirt off is pretty good so i'm gonna say canning town too.
28 Mar 16:44 - Bunn: ÓÄé
28 Mar 16:54 - Sam Roberts: Anyone up for drinking classy style tonight, I'm heading to dickens inn with Lucy and James, just by tower bridge i think
28 Mar 16:57 - Vanessa: Is it at St Katharine Docks?
28 Mar 16:58 - Sam Roberts: Yeah that's the one, been there?
28 Mar 16:58 - Vanessa: I want a fancy drink but somewhere easier to get to
28 Mar 16:58 - Vanessa: Nope haven't been there

30 Mar 10:34 - Tegan: Yours abandonned in the park, or yours on your head? I am very much on favour of the second option
30 Mar 10:35 - Tegan: In
30 Mar 10:35 - Shaggy: The latter
30 Mar 10:36 - Mike Prime: I just made it look like we stole your hat and left it at the park because it pleased me

30 Mar 12:01 - Tegan: Tonight, I fly
30 Mar 12:01 - Tegan: Today I sit and try to summon the energy
31 Mar 13:15 - Sam Roberts: So the magnificent Marty suggested a burger trip tomorrow evening, anyone else up for it? I'd like to try meatliquor after that delicious article Lora sent round
31 Mar 14:12 - ‚Ä™+44 7944 609055‚Ä¨: Spare ticket going for Black Star at the coronet tonight - 30 quid

31 Mar 15:09 - Sam Roberts: What's black star? Coronet is the one by elephant and castle right?
31 Mar 15:14 - ‚Ä™+44 7944 609055‚Ä¨: Most def & talib kweli
31 Mar 15:15 - ‚Ä™+44 7944 609055‚Ä¨: *mos
31 Mar 15:51 - Sam Roberts: Sounds dirty, I've only got my suit to wear, I think I'd get shanked
31 Mar 16:00 - Owen: Racist much!?
31 Mar 16:03 - Sam Roberts: Against elephant and castle? Definitely
31 Mar 16:03 - Owen: Sounds foreign, I'll probably have my wallet stolen.
31 Mar 16:25 - Sam Roberts: Keep your hands in your pockets, it'll be fine
31 Mar 16:25 - Owen: Nah I'll just stay at home. I have way too much work to do.
1 Apr 13:50 - Bunn: Had a looong meeting at the architects this morning but it was ok cos the meeting room was next to the canal
1 Apr 13:51 - Bunn: <Media omitted>
1 Apr 13:51 - Bunn: Then stopped off at look mum no hands for lunch which was awesome
1 Apr 13:51 - Bunn: <Media omitted>
1 Apr 13:51 - Bunn: And i got interviewed for a cycling channel about being a london cyclist
1 Apr 13:52 - Bunn: I dont think my answer 'i like cycling in london cos its dangerous' will be used
1 Apr 14:00 - Sam Roberts: Haha nice one! Was that on look mum no hands? Love that place, they fixed up my breaks for free
1 Apr 18:10 - Vanessa: I could kill for a coffee
1 Apr 18:20 - Martha: What time's dinner again?
1 Apr 18:23 - Sam Roberts: Meeting about 7.30, this place is too cool to book tables, I'll find somewhere to pub n meet before
1 Apr 18:30 - Dave Mendes da Costa: Where is it?
1 Apr 18:31 - Mike Prime: Meatlicquor
1 Apr 18:31 - Mike Prime: I think its vegan
1 Apr 18:31 - Sam Roberts: Meatliqour, by bond street
1 Apr 18:32 - Dave Mendes da Costa: Apparently its good for us veggies
1 Apr 18:47 - Sam Roberts: I'll be in the Woodstock

1 Apr 18:48 - Martha: Aaight. I've got one more thing to finish then I'm a outta here and over there (I'm 10 mins away) xx
1 Apr 18:48 - Martha: (From when I leave...)
1 Apr 18:49 - Sam Roberts: Yeah, no queue at the mo, chap says there probably will be a little un by half past
1 Apr 18:50 - Sam Roberts: There's an itsu if you can't take our company for the 10 mins it'll take! X
1 Apr 18:56 - Mike Prime: Worth going in for 8? In C town, can't leave til Lorna shows up
1 Apr 18:56 - Sam Roberts: Yeah it's still early, we can eat at 8 np
1 Apr 18:59 - Owen: Who is lorna that name really rings a bell.
1 Apr 19:03 - Sam Roberts: Woodstock closed, we're in the spread eagle instead
1 Apr 19:40 - Bunn: Loving how light it still is!
1 Apr 19:42 - Vanessa: Are you still at the pub?
1 Apr 19:42 - Dave Mendes da Costa: Yea
1 Apr 19:54 - Martha: I'm on my way, see you at meatliquor?
1 Apr 20:05 - Sam Roberts: Just having a cheeky one at the pub, check here first x
1 Apr 20:15 - Mike Prime: I'm on new bond street, where am I going?
1 Apr 20:15 - Dave Mendes da Costa: location: https://maps.google.com/?q=51.5143373,-0.1476895
2 Apr 08:31 - Sam Roberts: Great burgering everyone, I'm really glad that Ed's was closed!
2 Apr 08:58 - Martha: Agreed! Double fail = tasty win. Lovely to see you all xx
2 Apr 09:31 - Mike Prime: Odysseus would be proud. Excellent burgering y'all
2 Apr 09:34 - Vanessa: Sam I think you may have figured out how to avoid those silly queues
2 Apr 09:35 - Dave Mendes da Costa: Yeah that was a great night. Next time I'm having a burger tho! Xc
2 Apr 09:47 - Sam Roberts: Yeah, drink until the sensible people have gone home!
2 Apr 18:44 - Bunn: If anyone wants a taste card for ¬£30 instead of ¬£80 use code MENU8
Plus you get a free ¬£23 cork screw!
2 Apr 18:45 - Bunn: <Media omitted>
2 Apr 18:52 - Mike Prime: Man what does a ¬£23 corkscrew look like?
2 Apr 18:53 - Mike Prime: Couldn't you buy a robot butler for that kind of money?
2 Apr 19:44 - Shaggy: 29.99 + 3xFREE = 102.99
2 Apr 19:44 - Shaggy: That's math
2 Apr 20:23 - Bongo: That's numberwang
2 Apr 20:23 - Bongo: What's a taste card?
2 Apr 22:27 - Bunn: 50% off at certain restaurants
2 Apr 22:27 - Bunn: Like chico banditos
3 Apr 09:50 - Martha: Dave & Mike - from our discussion the other night: you can infer the (fact-checked) arguments for and against EU here: http://www.buzzfeed.com/owenspottiswoode/12-things-we-learned-from-nick-clegg-and-nigel-far-nmzm?s=mobile
3 Apr 09:56 - Dave Mendes da Costa: Cheers Marth. God bless the facts. X
3 Apr 10:06 - Owen: Interesting. Apparently like 70% people think farage won the debate according to the guardian.
3 Apr 10:08 - Owen: I personally don't care. I just don't think that in a democracy politicians really have that much power. Gove is trying his best to fuck up education and still isn't really making a dent.
3 Apr 10:32 - Dave Mendes da Costa: From all accounts I'm reading Andrew Lansley's Health and Social Care Act has essentially privatised the NHS. I'd keep my eyes on politicians - it's when we stop watching them that the shit hits the fan.
3 Apr 10:34 - Owen: What yah gonna do. As long as I don't have to pay for health insurance.
3 Apr 10:34 - Owen: Which I never will. If any politician suggested such a thing there would be a recall election or a vote of no confidence.
3 Apr 11:30 - Vanessa: I'm looking for new tunes, anybody have any suggestions?
3 Apr 11:32 - Owen: Sting and The Police!
3 Apr 11:32 - Owen: Blondie
3 Apr 11:32 - Owen: Eric satie
3 Apr 11:33 - Owen: Yes
3 Apr 11:33 - Owen: Rush
3 Apr 11:42 - Hannah: Hiatus kaiyote
3 Apr 11:42 - Hannah: Moonchild
3 Apr 11:53 - Vanessa: Thanks!
3 Apr 18:37 - Mike Prime: Thanks for the link Marth. My gut definitely says it would be dumb to leave the EU, but all the arguments I see either for or against it seem very vague and notional...
3 Apr 18:38 - Mike Prime: Also I reckon the yougov poll was probly skewed by the fact that people hate clegg
3 Apr 19:11 - Owen: I would like to see stats on how much import and export tax is saved by being in the EU.
3 Apr 19:12 - Owen: Also I think the reasons for being part of it are vague and complicated whereas the reasons for not being part basically boil down to saving a small amount of money and stopping immigration.
3 Apr 19:16 - Owen: I am fairly sure I am pro EU not because of its benefits (I don't really know what they are) but because I don't think the arguments against it are compelling. I am basically anti xenophobe. And apparently included in that set is being pro European union.
3 Apr 20:06 - Tegan: I am pro eu because I fully dig passing through Borders with no problems
3 Apr 20:07 - Tegan: Liberte! Egalite! Fraternite!
3 Apr 20:07 - Tegan: (No accents, sorry French)
3 Apr 20:13 - Owen: I agree with you. That seems like a pretty small reason. I am fairly sure the EU is actually fairly inconsequential though.
3 Apr 20:14 - Tegan: It feels like the closest thing to idealism which we still have a commitment to
3 Apr 21:29 - Sam Roberts: Arguing against the eu just feels like xenophobic atavism, I'd love it if there were poignant arguments for Britain to be a member for itself, but I feel completely happy with the idea that we make a net loss, with a huge gain in other countries
3 Apr 21:29 - Sam Roberts: Looking over the history of colonial Britain, I think we owe the world a bit
3 Apr 21:34 - Alan: The only way human society can overcome the worlds problems (environment, war, inequality, crime, etc) is through political globalisation. The eu is a big step in that direction. Even if Britain gained did gain by leaving the eu, theres bigger issues at play here than just being 1 or 2% wealthier.
3 Apr 21:35 - Alan: Anyone around for post work beers tomorrow night?
3 Apr 21:35 - Mike Prime: I don't know that immigration is good for other countries though. Seems like a lot of poorer countries lose a lot of bright people that way
3 Apr 21:41 - Mike Prime: Beers beers beers. Just saw your email, Alan, where are you guys off to?
3 Apr 21:54 - Alan: Vietnam (probably).  To Danang
4 Apr 00:11 - Tegan: Waaaah
4 Apr 08:13 - Hannah: If of interest to anyone, next Saturday 12th, singing a concert with my choir. It's in an awesome church in hackney, there will be light show and an amazing beatboxer. Tickets here:  http://www.londoncontemporaryvoices.co.uk/tickets/
4 Apr 08:13 - Hannah: (Choirz r cool)

4 Apr 09:08 - Shaggy: What do these hipsters come out with now?
4 Apr 09:08 - Shaggy: Also, best soap in the world:
4 Apr 09:08 - Shaggy: <Media omitted>
4 Apr 09:24 - Sam Roberts: Delicious
4 Apr 09:24 - Sam Roberts: I don't get the to one, painted pillars?
4 Apr 09:25 - Owen: Bike pump station.
4 Apr 09:25 - Mike Prime: Public bike pump
4 Apr 09:25 - Mike Prime: Looks like a trap to me
4 Apr 09:26 - Sam Roberts: Looks like a detonator
4 Apr 09:27 - Sam Roberts: Pretty cool though, for when you've been ignoring that flat halfway to work
4 Apr 09:32 - Bunn: I think bike pump stations are a good thing
4 Apr 09:35 - Shaggy: I like the idea that they are detonators for bombs planted in infidel states, that way government can claim it was the will if the people, Putin style
4 Apr 11:07 - Bongo: Dark
4 Apr 19:35 - Martha: Are we cycling to uxbridge tomorrow then? Ey ey?
4 Apr 19:36 - Tegan: Weather says wet.... Also our skin tanks have burst a bit. Dave, status report? X
4 Apr 19:39 - Martha: F***ing weather, just when it was starting to get good. Ok. Board games series fry-up all day breakfast and pyjamas anyone? Ey ey?
4 Apr 19:50 - Dave Mendes da Costa: Right, sorry about the late update. We have a problem with the boat which *may* be fixed tomorrow but may not. So I think its best to cancel boat plans for this weekend (also rainy) and say that we will cruise another day. Sorry all. Xx
4 Apr 19:50 - Mike Prime: Sam is that Maddox's video?
4 Apr 19:52 - Dave Mendes da Costa: Goig! Why that video? Why?
4 Apr 19:53 - Mike Prime: Lol. I think Sam got whatsraped
4 Apr 19:54 - Dave Mendes da Costa: I feel like my eyes got whatsraped
4 Apr 19:55 - Mike Prime: Yeah that's Maddox's current favourite conversation starter
4 Apr 20:07 - Sam Roberts: I like it....
4 Apr 20:07 - Sam Roberts: Big ride somewhere else? The weather literally doesn't matter when you're riding, and I'm jonesing for a trip now!
4 Apr 20:15 - Bongo: I don't have a bike plus I'll be knackered, up for anything else though
4 Apr 20:16 - Tegan: Cruising potential for Sunday? If fixed?
4 Apr 20:25 - Sam Roberts: Similar... so Pete's uncle is doing some circus stunt off the Olympic tower at ten in Saturday, we could see that
4 Apr 20:25 - Sam Roberts: Also I don't really believe in bad weather, wear shorts and it doesn't matter at all
4 Apr 20:26 - Mike Prime: Where does the Raid 2 come into all of this?
4 Apr 20:41 - Bunn: I like beer
4 Apr 20:42 - ‚Ä™+44 7545 989149‚Ä¨: I like cycling and beer.
4 Apr 20:45 - Martha: I could be in. It will depend on exactly how rainy it is. I cycled 1 hr from Herne hill last week and it was torrential and cold and NOT SO FUN. xx
4 Apr 21:27 - Martha: TWO SHOES: Cat Empire playing at Somerset House festival (outdoors) in July

4 Apr 21:44 - Mike Prime: ¬£29 for a Sunday gig? Wha?
4 Apr 22:31 - Dave Mendes da Costa: Yes! I'm in x
4 Apr 23:08 - Martha: Mike, weren't you there last time? It was awesome.
4 Apr 23:08 - Martha: Awesome.
4 Apr 23:21 - Phil 2: It sucked. They never played two shoes.
4 Apr 23:23 - Dave Mendes da Costa: Yeah, and there was some drunk Austrian swinging his t shirt over his head the whole time
4 Apr 23:25 - Sam Roberts: They played two shoes!
4 Apr 23:25 - Sam Roberts: Never mind
4 Apr 23:29 - Dave Mendes da Costa: It is a lot for a ticket. Thoughts? X
4 Apr 23:30 - Dave Mendes da Costa: Btw, just listening to Night Walks by Hidden Orchestra again. Such a good album.

5 May 14:54 - Owen: It's only 13.5% but...
5 May 14:54 - Owen: <Media omitted>

8 May 10:40 - Sam Roberts: Have you booked?
8 May 10:41 - Shaggy: Did you know bjork recorded her first album at 12? I don't like the woman, but that's hella impressive
8 May 10:43 - Mike Prime: GODZIIIRRRAAAA
8 May 10:43 - Mike Prime: Well up for that
8 May 10:43 - Owen: I have not booked. I probably should though.
8 May 10:48 - Mike Prime: Asap, there's still some pretty good seats left for the 8.45 showing but not that many. Buy as a group?
8 May 10:49 - Sam Roberts: I kind of promised to go with James, I'm booking so can just make him come along to whenever
8 May 10:50 - Eliza Bott: We're thinking maybe the Sunday 8.45 instead - there's more seats left. Any strong preferences either way?
8 May 10:50 - Sam Roberts: He was up for one of the big screens non-Imax though
8 May 10:50 - Sam Roberts: Downside: smaller screen upside: dbox seats (they shake you like an earthquake simulator)
8 May 10:51 - Sam Roberts: Probably better availability, thoughts?
8 May 10:52 - Eliza Bott: Which cinema is that Sam?
8 May 10:52 - Mike Prime: I would love to go to imax, never went before, but Ill do whatever
8 May 10:53 - Owen: IMAX!!!!
8 May 10:53 - Owen: 8:45
8 May 10:53 - Owen: Sunday
8 May 10:54 - Dave Mendes da Costa: So that's a week on Sunday, right?
8 May 10:55 - Eliza Bott: Yup
8 May 10:55 - Dave Mendes da Costa: Tegan, we could come back from rickmansworth for that, I expect most of the excitement will be over by then. Thoughts?
8 May 10:57 - Sam Roberts: Hehe, ok ok Imax
8 May 10:57 - Shaggy: Can you book all tickets? Will be easier to just pay you back
8 May 10:57 - Owen: Yeah thats the plan
8 May 10:58 - Owen: Eliza will send an email to the cates and marthas of the world who don't wassap.
8 May 11:00 - Eliza Bott: Sam let me know if I should book a ticket for you and James. I don't think I have his email.
8 May 11:04 - Mike Prime: I'm in obv
8 May 11:05 - Shaggy: Do you think mike will want to go? He hasn't said anything yet and I don't think he likes these types of movies
8 May 11:07 - Mike Prime: What can I say, I like to keep my cards close to my chest
8 May 11:11 - Sam Roberts: One for me please Eliza
8 May 11:17 - Owen: Yeah shaggy it really doesn't sound like mikes type of thing. We will leave him off the list.
8 May 12:18 - Bunn: For the best

9 May 16:51 - Sam Roberts: There's always the gable to start, that place is mad cheap. It gets a bit shit later on but it's always a laugh until then
9 May 16:56 - Sam Roberts: Shush you, get back to your gin and tonics x
9 May 16:57 - Shaggy: Why don't you go someplace not full of suits?
9 May 17:00 - Dave Mendes da Costa: Agreed. Screw the gable
9 May 17:03 - Sam Roberts: But suits is all I know!
9 May 17:05 - Sam Roberts: Someone choose a place then, maybe something like katzenjammers?
9 May 17:08 - Tegan: I don't know what that is. .. But I do know my feets is getting itchy...
9 May 17:10 - Shaggy: Got a work thing, watching a film on us health system
9 May 17:16 - Bunn: I 'm staying north to go gigging in islington x
9 May 17:23 - Tegan: Bongo, whassup? I'm heading now
9 May 17:24 - Tegan: By which I mean, do you fancy having a drink round here while these guys group source a decision?
9 May 17:25 - Sam Roberts: Any nice pubs around there?
9 May 17:26 - Sam Roberts: In the absence of anything standing out as outstanding, how about a could of pints near holborn and home for a film and takeaway at ours?
9 May 17:27 - Tegan: Works for me
9 May 17:30 - Tegan: It is an area of distinctly average pubs though
9 May 17:30 - Tegan: Mostly owned by the Northern beer mangate Sam Smith
9 May 17:30 - Tegan: Whose rubbish beer is no longer even any cheaper than anyone else's
9 May 17:31 - Tegan: So I'm happy to travel :)
9 May 17:35 - Dave Mendes da Costa: I'm leaving now. Where shall I join y'all? X

10 May 17:15 - Vanessa: There's no such thing as enough toppings
10 May 17:15 - Vanessa: Pizzas haven't yet hit the oven

11 May 21:33 - Vanessa: The kitchen better be clean. It'll make it quicker to do dinner
11 May 22:32 - Hannah: Final reminder to get your early bird tickets to the tandem festival
11 May 22:33 - Hannah: ¬£45 tonight - goes up to ¬£75 after midnight xxx
11 May 22:50 - Shaggy: I thought it was ninth
11 May 23:25 - Hannah: End of the week meant Sunday not Friday I think xx
12 May 07:37 - Mike Prime: Quote from the review of the Postman Pat movie I just read:
12 May 07:37 - Mike Prime: "The murderous bionic cat shooting lasers out of its eyes proved a turning point"
12 May 10:37 - Bongo: Lol sounds intriguing
12 May 10:57 - Hannah: My aunt is one of the original illustrators of postman pat books :)
12 May 11:03 - Owen: Big deal! My aunt is that bionic lazer eye cat!
12 May 11:04 - ‚Ä™+44 7545 989149‚Ä¨: Does a laser eye cat do laser eye surgery?
12 May 12:01 - Tegan: Cats can't be surgeons!
12 May 12:01 - Tegan: Silly
12 May 12:02 - Owen: Nope. She destroys small villages!
12 May 12:02 - ‚Ä™+44 7545 989149‚Ä¨: Not with that attitude!
12 May 12:03 - Mike Prime: They're good at operating on cataracts
12 May 12:03 - Mike Prime: I feel dirty about that last post
12 May 12:03 - ‚Ä™+44 7545 989149‚Ä¨: http://i.imgur.com/VQLGJOL.gif
12 May 12:13 - ‚Ä™+44 7545 989149‚Ä¨: So who else heard very bad reviews of Godzilla?
12 May 12:14 - ‚Ä™+44 7545 989149‚Ä¨: I hope its a big plan to lower my Godzilla sized expectations, before absolutely smashing them later...
12 May 12:19 - Mike Prime: 85% on rotten tomatoes
12 May 12:22 - ‚Ä™+44 7545 989149‚Ä¨: I saw a couple of 2 star reviews knocking about. Might be people who accidentally watched the Matthew Broderick version though...
12 May 12:23 - Mike Prime: I must be the only one who liked that film
12 May 12:23 - Mike Prime: It had bloody Godzilla in it. People are too fussy.
12 May 12:38 - Owen: I'm the same mike.
12 May 12:40 - ‚Ä™+44 7545 989149‚Ä¨: I went to see it in the cinema for my birthday. Thought it was great. Haven't seen it since though...
12 May 12:40 - Owen: Eliza keeps trying to tell me its a bad film but we always come back to its one redeaming feature.  It has godzilla in it. Seriously godzilla adds about the same amount to a film as a film being the film taxi driver adds to a film.
12 May 12:41 - Owen: Dan it had gozilla in it. Therefore it was great!
12 May 12:42 - ‚Ä™+44 7545 989149‚Ä¨: I thought I might have imagined that in my 11 year old birthday excitement and sugar rush.
12 May 12:42 - ‚Ä™+44 7545 989149‚Ä¨: Glad to hear it was real.
12 May 13:53 - Shaggy: If rotten tomatoes says it's good then I'm going to hate that film. Joy
12 May 17:31 - Hannah: Hi guys is anyone back at canning town yet? Shaggy is at drumming till later but I wanna come for meat Monday within the next hour. Will anyone be there to let me in? Will anyone talk to me?
12 May 17:32 - Mike Prime: Phil'll be in, he doesn't check WhatsApp much tho
12 May 17:33 - Shaggy: Or door bell.
12 May 17:39 - Mike Prime: If you do decide to climb the fence, be careful of the barbed wire
12 May 17:57 - Phil 2: I'm here. I'll let you in.
12 May 19:21 - Martha: On my way! 40mins x
12 May 21:44 - Martha: Hey shagalam, eta?
12 May 21:53 - Martha: Slam? Shag's back. We're watching in 3...

13 May 07:27 - Mike Prime: Man those burgers last night
13 May 07:28 - Mike Prime: <Media omitted>
13 May 09:51 - Phil 2: Yea they turned out real good. Can't wait for next week to kick it up a notch.
13 May 10:25 - Sam Roberts: Homemade burgers? Or did you find some secret Burgeria?
13 May 11:55 - Phil 2: Mike is referring to the thick slabs of pork that were marinating the entire day. They were crazy tasty. Def getting the meat from the morrisons butchers from now on.
13 May 12:59 - Sam Roberts: Sounds most boday, sorry I missed it!
13 May 13:00 - Sam Roberts: Is there any left? Sounds like a perfect post climbing snack, if it survives that long
13 May 13:17 - Phil 2: I reckon I'll turn the leftovers into some kind of pie tonite. Can't guarantee how long it'll survive tho.
13 May 13:42 - Tegan: Mmmmmmpie
13 May 13:42 - Tegan: Yo slam- what is the branding on your vapour tool guy? Why is it better than cheaper ones?
13 May 15:02 - Sam Roberts: Truvape is the name of the flame, I did zero research into it except trying Nialls once, so there's probably a better product out there
13 May 15:03 - Sam Roberts: If you think it it a buying 4 packs it cigarettes, which will last about 2 months, it makes the thing seen really cheap though, and they've got food customer service so far. I'm a fan
13 May 15:03 - Sam Roberts: Mmmmpie sounds delicious, I'll get the climbing out the way asap
13 May 15:53 - Shaggy: Please disable swype, you type like a crazy tape worm on a dance machine
13 May 16:10 - Owen: Swype increases speed by 50%. But you end up having to explain more than half your mesages so it saves no time in the long run.

16 May 12:45 - Sam Roberts: Sounds good, don't think I'm getting out before 6.30, let's do new change on a mid week evening so we've got a chance of a seat
16 May 13:37 - Shaggy: Park sounds lush, unfortunately there's not much around London bridge, kennington park is nice
16 May 14:00 - Sam Roberts: What about that little one by borough? We'd have the glad when things get dingy
16 May 14:02 - Shaggy: There are a few small parks around, they are not wonderful but some are quite homely.

20 May 11:31 - Dave Mendes da Costa: Surely a holiday should warrant a double bill?
20 May 11:33 - Owen: I know. Double bill with double gore and double boobs.
20 May 11:33 - Owen: Resulting in eight times as much game of thrones.
20 May 11:35 - Dave Mendes da Costa: What went wrong America?

22 May 11:43 - Owen: Its less that a pint.
22 May 11:44 - Owen: A pint lasts about 30 minutes
22 May 11:44 - Owen: You will play this game more than 30 minutes
22 May 11:46 - Sam Roberts: But which makes you floop more?

22 May 18:07 - Tegan: On my way
22 May 18:08 - Sam Roberts: Pretty tempted to skip the quiz, it's not like I know anything, but it's not often enough you can get first year drunk for free
22 May 18:10 - Tegan: I was quite surprised at my decision... Most unlikeme to turn down free booze.  I must be getting paid to much.
22 May 18:14 - Sam Roberts: Quick! Demand a pay cut! They're after your integrity!

22 May 19:42 - Alan: Hi all. There's lots of rain predicted in Saturday, so cat and I are trying to work out where to host our leaving bash. Do you guys remember the name of the place where Bunn had his birthday thing on the canal? Or can any of you recommend any decent pubs that have a fair amount of space in the northeast/east London area?
22 May 19:49 - Bongo: Bar 90 in dalston or something similar with a 9 in it
22 May 19:50 - Bongo: Hackney wick I mean
22 May 19:50 - Bongo: That place was the bomb

22 May 21:46 - Sam Roberts: We have an excess of plans, the only question is whether Henry is coming to night tales by choice, or if we're making him
22 May 22:41 - Alan: So tomorrow - is night tales after Henry's thing? I thought Craig was going to Henry's...
22 May 22:44 - Alan: Fairground looks like a good possibility.
22 May 23:06 - Bunn: Fairground is excellent

23 May 20:48 - Bunn: Except The Nextmen, and the funk hunters

27 May 12:23 - Angie: :)
28 May 08:53 - Sam Roberts: So I've bought some mud guards that don't fit my bike, anyone have a mountain bike that needs some? Free to a good home
28 May 09:57 - Owen: God damn you Sam you sneaky bastard! I just figured out why my phone keyboard was behaving so weirdly!!!
28 May 10:14 - Sam Roberts: Mwahahahah! Also, I got the reddit app, win all round!
28 May 10:34 - Angie: I'm intrigued, what happened to your keyboard??
28 May 10:57 - Henry: dont get the reddit app youll never get anything done ever again!
28 May 10:58 - Angie: ...I'm gonna get the reddit app
28 May 10:58 - Bunn: I dont like doing things either
28 May 10:58 - Henry: haha
28 May 10:59 - Sam Roberts: Some gangster turned off auto spacing and auto capitalisation, that's what happened
28 May 10:59 - Sam Roberts: I feel like I'm graduating Henry, imgur app has taken my hours for too long!
28 May 11:01 - Henry: there is better stuff on reddit, try /r/showerthoughts and /r/Britishproblems
28 May 11:03 - Henry: what tv are ppl watching atm? im stuck at home ill and need something to binge
28 May 11:04 - Angie: Have you watched the US office? Great binging fodder
28 May 11:05 - Henry: Actually I never saw that I always assumed it was rubbish
28 May 11:06 - Angie: Get past the first few episodes, which try to copy the uk one, and then it gets going and is really funny
28 May 11:09 - Owen: It was some very subtle trolling Sam. I kept just thinking my fingers had got fatter or something.
28 May 11:09 - Owen: Yeah once you get to the second series it is a lot better.
28 May 11:10 - Owen: The first series just try to copy the British one. But because they are American they don't seem to get the humor.
28 May 11:10 - Angie: They can't do it half as cringey and awkward
28 May 11:11 - Angie: I liked it from the first few episodes though
28 May 11:16 - Henry: sweet, full day of tv binging sorted
28 May 11:31 - Mike Prime: The toilets at my work are like a Faraday cage, so I can't look at reddit at work without my boss seeing :(
28 May 11:32 - Angie: Your boss sounds creepy!
28 May 11:39 - Bunn: Gross dude
28 May 11:39 - Bunn: My toilet naps would be busted
28 May 11:40 - Bunn: Iv spent the morning listening to GoT audiobooks on youtube
28 May 11:40 - Bunn: So much easier than actually doing the reading
28 May 11:45 - Sam Roberts: You're my hero Bunn, taking lethargy to new levels
28 May 11:46 - Sam Roberts: You listen while you work? I got a bollocking for wearing headphones once. I need a new job...
28 May 11:47 - Angie: What! I quite often watch tv at work and people are fine with it
28 May 11:50 - Henry: yea you defo need a new job sam, Id go crazy if I couldnt listen to headphones at work!
28 May 11:51 - Bunn: Hope you asked that Q for your new job mate!
28 May 12:35 - Sam Roberts: Hah yeah, first thing I asked
28 May 12:37 - Sam Roberts: For those bemused, I've got a new job, starting June 23rd, I'm thinking celebration meal on the 19th to ease into tandem festival. Save the date
28 May 12:56 - Mike Prime: Man your old place sounds dumb. Sometimes I just put my headphones in with no sound on, it's better than ambient noise!
28 May 13:05 - Tegan: I want headphones that play silence
28 May 13:05 - Tegan: Then I will know I live in the future
28 May 13:11 - Mike Prime: Noise cancelling headphones aren't that expensive these days, like ¬£40 for a cheap pair?
28 May 13:24 - Shaggy: Cheap headphones that claim to do expensive things are a waste of money
28 May 13:29 - Mike Prime: I think expensive headphones are a waste of money, there I said it
28 May 13:30 - Shaggy: Maybe on your ears
28 May 13:31 - Henry: I dunno man good headphones are heavenly,  I used to go thru a pair every six months till I shelled out for good ones, theyve lasted 5 years
28 May 13:43 - Mike Prime: Yeah longevity is a good point. I leave mine at work though, use inner ear on commute, so doesn't matter so much.
28 May 13:51 - Mike Prime: I think audiophiles are kidding themselves though. Its like high end wine tasting.
28 May 13:58 - Sam Roberts: I'm pretty sure it's just what your used to, going back to computer speakers when you've been listening to real ones for a little while is painful, you never realise how bad the quality is
28 May 14:00 - Sam Roberts: And I'll never forgive Vanessa for educating me about burgers. Now I know what they're supposed to taste like, I can't even finish a McDonald's
