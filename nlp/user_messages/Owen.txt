wassap.i don't know sam said something about trains i liked the idea of hiring a car but then again i can't drive and mainly liked the idea of getting drunk with shaggy distracting the driver until we careered into a hedge.since we can't stay on the first wouldn't it be best for everyone to go by car.don't we need at least one car to get us from brocksbursy leminghurst town or whatever its called to sam's.me and eliza will do the same thing as you sam.scratch that we will do the same thang as whoever has the keys to the house.well add mine and eliza's unicycles and you will have a tricycle

this morning was not any news.does that say fuk or fun.fun you hannah.rotten tomatoes has american hustle at so it can't be all bad me and liza were thinking of seeing it.really why it seems pretty accurate to me and has a simple easy to understand algorithm.perhaps you just have terrible taste in films shaggy also if it consistently disagrees with you then it is an excellent system you just need to do the opposite of what it says.can you give me examples of where it is wrong.so you have no idea if it is good or bad then.i generally find it pretty excellent.i think you may be confusing the website with the fruit.also is very close to fresh the only problem i have with rotten tomatoes is the binary nature of fresh rotten if you just go by percentage instead it is more accurate.better than crap not as good as great.shaggy how is your bum hairier than your face.less hairy.that explains a lot it also raises many questions.tbh gravity needed more lizard men.i would guess about m wow i was way off.i was thinking about it compared to the birj kalifa in dubai i assumed that the shard would be over half its height easily nope.you are also both way off.phil has been closest so far.to be fair the question is ambiguous and the pupil has given a correct answer given the ambiguity.zero because that answer is awesome.jesus christ guys how could you leave out elevenses.between brunch and half lunch.but hannah asked a serious question you don't answer those v.thank you for supporting me in my decision to be an idiot dear wife.i like how the cat has a mousetash hehe mouse tash because

not be wearing clothes.actually i made a mistake also i did manage to put some boxers on before leaving i also got a game of leagues in while waiting for eliza this is not the reason we are late honest i got kills though every cloud.what does hb mean phil.i don't want to alarm you all but i have the makings ofa game better than the demon game.a warning that film is by lars von trier his previous films have included a woman cutting off her own genitalia he is fucked up so i doubt it will be what you are expecting.happy birthday bunndamental particle.more on my new game it is called cold war conundrum also shaggy can you add dan to this group please.the game is coming together i have written all the rules which weekends are people free btw dan i have made a new game a bit like the demon game but shorter and with more spies and moles and tailing and scavenger hunting it is called cold war conundrum.can i email you the rules and get your input before sharing with everyone you were a great help with the demon game are you danruddick hotmail com.hey in fact bunn would you like to do this for your birthday part of the game is that it ends up in a pub anyway a pub in which we could have pub lunch.saturday whats happening tonight by the way.already done dan.the spy game is so good by the way i haven't played it yet but i think it is better than the demon game.this isn't gaming banter this is for everyone.except sarah she did not like the demon game yeah but shaggy this is not a video game this is a game that hopefully everyone will play also cold war conundrum does not contain the word spy or the word game.ok what topics are allowed in this group then baas.dude hackney wick is the worst place to get to we will be there but we will be angry and possibly late.gr.the overground isn't running to hackney wick how mike.looking at the tube map hackney wick is all on its own.it stops on minutes in not all the overground just the stratford line.cool jazz improves things.the guy at the station reckons that trains are running so we are going to try.turns out the trains are fine stupid tfl lying to me.good timing on your birthday bunn i am fairly sure i wouldn't have made it in tomorrow if it wasn't half term hashtag drunk....me and eliza are in london doing arty stuff anyone up for the pub later once you finish work.❄  where in old street.ok that

ut the grass is still wet.i ate an entire pack of ham and a loaf of bread so no thank you.where are you moving from where to what do you need.date is it a weekend i will help carry if it is also if you still need a place aftet fran l i am sure me an eliza will be able to sort you out after..batshag ew.what were all of you doing last night and why would you get that smashed on a weekday night hangovers on sunday are fine a work day hangover is terrible i did not enjoy monday.we might be late we missed our train and there are delays on northern line.and but i'm more interested in my initial thoughts were that if you had the only house on a street you wouldn't number it you would name it then i realised that surely for every house number there would be a number so they should at least be equal i come to the conclusion that if you own house you are less likely to sell i have yet to figure out why.benfords law..oh yeah i knew about that didn't know it was called benfords law that why i was surprised by the fact that there were fewer s than s night night now owen sleeps.lol shaggy just stated a fact why did you lol.it was good.martha i am going to be playing catan with xav all day.that took a while.i think xav already has it however we could make player catan with a second expansion.new rule the people with bikes do not make the decisions about where we go.it stands for comma seperated values its a really simple ascii encoding each comma means a new cell and two commas means a new row.probably what program generated your csv file teegs..that should work.i'm not sure how it will handle row delimeters though i don't know or use postges i just have used csvs a lot in the past.cool so no problem anymore.utf that should work.i am pretty sure csvs are utf oh yeah odd.open it in excel and then save with a known encoding.there wouldn't be.depends normally just blank sometimes.yeah.what is on trans customer line you might have an invalid charcter or something.is that the whole table or one of the headings.not always shaggy it's an option an option that it doesn't look like it was ticked judging by the notepad screenshot.try reexporting your csv from excel teegs choose a known haracter encoding and tick whatever option it is to put inverted commas around strings it might be called encapsulate strings.oh you are right excel doesn't have that.hmm i just tried it out and shaggy is right on newer versions of excel it automatically adds where necessary.im home ill anyway.the sum of all the natural numbers is equal to this is crazy mathematicians arise and explain..why not.numberphile sum of natural numbers youtube.there are two proofs one of which uses the reimann zeta function.i don't really get what makes a series divegent though because is divergent even though it feels like it shouldn't be why is it cheating.that is what they guy did in the video he did zeta and then took away zeta or something i forget exactly how he did it it feels like cheating.nah let the prols that inhabit this thread learn something also apparently is divergent which makes no sense.physicists have finally figured out why the force of gravity is so weak bunns mum stole it all.is it for doing elevetated sit ups.i don't know what to do with it the comments for your business and leisure facilities including any files transmitted is a big problem.i snesw a uperiseing.fo al teaa fo al.when is it.nice i heard they have plans to place satchel charges in bagdad while they clutch onto their last tope of freedom bagpuns.is a sterling a bag.thanks for the update.racist much.sounds foreign i'll probably have my wallet stolen.nah i'll just stay at home i have way too much work to do.who is lorna that name really rings a bell.interesting apparently like people think farage won the debate according to the guardian i personally don't care i just don't think that in a democracy politicians really have that much power gove is trying his best to fuck up education and still isn't really making a dent.what yah gonna do as long as i don't have to pay for health insurance which i never will if any politician suggested such a thing there would be a recall election or a vote of no confidence.sting and the police blondie eric satie yes rush.i would like to see stats on how much import and export tax is saved by being in the eu also i think the reasons for being part of it are vague and complicated whereas the reasons for not being part basically boil down to saving a small amount of money and stopping immigration i am fairly sure i am pro eu not because of its benefits i don't really know what they are but because i don't think the arguments against it are compelling i am basically anti xenophobe and apparently included in that set is being pro european union.i agree with you that seems like a pretty small reason i am fairly sure the eu is actually fairly inconsequential though.bike pump station.guys spoliers.oh right i thought someone must have died in yesterday's episode i haven't seen it yet.sure see you soon.shall we bring booze food or both.sam wtf are you on about give me a list of shit to get you pansy.will do sam i shall get

alberton dj pad things i'd like to play around a bit as i'm contemplating asking for some of the setup for my birthday.do you.two girls one plane.two girls on a plane vomiting and freaking out.can you make a plane wassap or something this is not tits or beer.i havr no idea what is going on aren't you right next to each other were you on seperate planes.sam travelling first class im suprised they didn't chuck hm back with the rest of the prolls.who is with sam bunn.how are you using wassap on a plane.and they haven't let you off the plane with a fault.ah so everything is good then.yeah that's a pain i meant its good your whole trip didn't have to get cancelled.police what are you sure you are taking a ryanair to budapest and not a somalian pirate ship to egypt.oh thats nowhere near as exciting as i would expect from a shaggy and the police incident.who is going to petes thing tonight.i'm soon to arrive when will you be getting there.we at there bihatch.oj and eb inbound.eta i'm pretty sure that it starts counting as an industrial paint stipper once it gets to that high percentage it's only but.i recognise that sign you are on a west coast train.damn.oh by the way godzilla at imax on the th may for my birthday which is on the th followed by drinks at the bfi bar which does amazong whisky sours.i have not booked i probably should though.imax sunday.yeah thats the plan eliza will send an email to the cates and marthas of the world who don't wassap.yeah shaggy it really doesn't sound like mikes type of thing we will leave him off the list.really i thought mike hated godzilla thats why we didn't het him a ticket.you doing dough as well.what about bongoloid.big deal my aunt is that bionic lazer eye cat.nope she destroys small villages.i'm the same mike.eliza keeps trying to tell me its a bad film but we always come back to its one redeaming feature it has godzilla in it seriously godzilla adds about the same amount to a film as a film being the film taxi driver adds to a film dan it had gozilla in it therefore it was great.swype increases speed by but you end up having to explain more than half your mesages so it saves no time in the long run.happy birthday to you happy birthday to you happy birthday dear o oh wait yey its my birthday thank you guys.eww girls shaggy.next week will definitely be better because me and eliza will be there.mother of god.i know double bill with double gore and double boobs resulting in eight times as much game of thrones.schadenfreude.night night everyone hope you are all ok there seems to have been a dearth of activity on our usually clattering hoard.but owen jones is allowed in there.hmmm how do i convince my boss that this is work related.i don't understand it but it looks amazing.its less that a pint a pint lasts about minutes you will play this game more than minutes.it is pete's birthday today as well.i thought henry was having his thing tomorrow or maybe that is sarah so many things to keep track of.yeah i

right here.god damn you sam you sneaky bastard i just figured out why my phone keyboard was behaving so weirdly.it was some very subtle trolling sam i kept just thinking my fingers had got fatter or something yeah once you get to the second series it is a lot better the first series just try to copy the british one but because they are american they don't seem to get the humor.so it turns out that although your bosses seem to not want you taking a shit or wearing headphones they are perfectly happy with you spending the day on wassap.you could get noise cancelling headphones and play that silent john cage symphony teens tees oh ffs sam godamn you my autocorrect has forgotten all the words teegs.hmm i might stop by on my way home i just left oxford.ok me and eliza are on our way we will be there about ish maybe teegs that reminds me about godzilla money.someone suggest a good album that me owen will like.i'm at south bank where are peeps also those album recommendations were rubbish i ended up having to listen to the john cage silent symphony.we are on our way.mike you should do stats on who comments most and who gets mentioned most then do the ratio of the two then we could finally have what we all have been waiting for an objective measure of who is the most popular.no henry i think the person who doesn't comment much but gets mentioned a lot has the highest comment efficacy and therefore is the objectively best person.shaggy that link doesn't work for me who is it.owen owen owen owen owen owen owen.ah man i would have bet on myself i better up the ante.don't worry i am sure the quality will also improve.they call that the pre owe nice era i hate sam so much let me make my amazing joke again that should have said they call that period of time the preowenic

breast cancer playboy magazine says one might begin to question thier motivations.also if it's long skirts that cause breast cancer does that mean we can stop victim blaming when a woman in a short skirt gets raped because she was just trying to protect herself from cancer.it's like the people who do these studies have never heard of comorbidity.the skirt doesn't even cover the breasts how the hell would it cause them to get cancer.wait so a size is less likely to get cancer than a size why don't they just say people who are larger are generally less healthy the skirt thing is

mike i love that godzilla was the biggest word last may i must have really be looking forward to that film.been.i also like the progression from beers to shots as winter progresses.no she can't didn't she leave the horde a while back p s i am a bit annoyed she appears to have beaten me in the mentions thier own name most category.i seem to always come in pairs as does sam any ideas why mike.mike phil thanks you and phil asks if you going to do individual word clouds over time as well.all reddit comments thats some seriously big data...its actually a d.yeah there are three variables that set max min and spins.i can.are there any regular sided d shapes with flat plane surfaces what about irregular.nice.well a massive curved face will be landed on way more often than a really thin curved face like a coin will almost never be landed on so somewhere in between must be a size of face which is landed on rd of the time unless somehow the probability is quantized which i would find very difficult to belive.sadie i don't know who sadie is though..mike's word cloud is going to look really fucking odd for this month.just click decline offer.woop woop c town b b q i'll bring the meat everyone else bring the meat make some noise put another barbee on the c town c town massive down for tha b b q tldr i'll be there.i hope a lot that would be awesome twenty elizas each making twenty

me.did phil like it when it comes to dwayne the rock johnson there is no greater authority than phil the phil tschismarov.his legitimately favourite film is dredd.me and eliza spent half of mexico trying to convince him he was wrong he describes that movie as perfect..i knew you were into that..i am ashamed but i had to google non sequitur it's one of those words i understand when it is used but didn't know the definition of.a horse walks into a bar the bartender asks the horse if it's an alcoholic considering all the bars he frequents to which the horse replies i don't think i am poof the horse disappears this is the point in time when all the philosophy students in the audience begin to giggle as they are familiar with the philosophical proposition of cogito ergo sum or i think therefore i am but to explain the concept aforehand would be putting descartes before the horse.ok enough now have you seen the weathet here of course not you jamaica bastard..is that sam.he looks less like sam in that second photo and more like a young robert deniro.damnit i wish i was home and had photoshop i would be faceswapping right now.bongo where are you also have you updated your status on facebook.mike do you have a doublechin and neck beard app or something.i can't believe anyone is standing up for clarkson you don't get to punch a coworker over a cold steak just because you are famous for being a knob.doesn't mean you should be immune.the bbc still own the name they will just find some new presenters.jeremy clarkson doesn't shit gold he is just a balding middle aged white posh man with outdated opinions it's not like britain doesn't have loads of them lying about you could get nigel farage to host the show and i wouldn't be able to tell the difference.watch stewart lee and top gear on youtube stewart lee and top gear https youtu be kcnmqlpc.i think stuart lee should take over.stuart lee is hilarious shaggy watch that video i just posted.do you think jeremy clarkson is funny then shags.no its the one about wishing hammond had died in that crash but its only a joke you know like on top gear.i just don't get why anyone finds an ignorant old man who should know better funny his jokes literally consist of asian peoples eyes are slanted and post colonial britain has a derogatory term for that the term slope you know what else has slopes bridges do oh look a bridge with an asian person on it wow slope on a slope hahahahahahahaha slope slopey slope slope slop hahahahaha nudge nudge wink wink were all thinking it aren't we middle britain slope ha well no jeremy i'm not thinking that all you have done is said there is a person on a bridge but somehow you have managed to do so in the most casually racist way possible.yeah because its a character not just a racist guy.totally.problem is that clarkson isn't clueless a yr old granma from rotherham is funny because she is clueless.clarkson is something went to private school and probably has family money from colonialism knocking about his views don't come from cluelessness his view views come from a much more insidious place.steve coogan and rob brydon would be a good combo.also i think coogan is actually really into cars.yeah and they already have great chemistry have you seen the trip.does there need to be a third.hahahahha.which would allow them to keep the casual racism that has made top gear so popular.nope otherwise fith gear would be popular.ok its settled the new top gear cast is steve coogan rob brydon and dwayne the rock johnson.worst mark scheme ever they might as well write pupil has put the correct answer down.this is a proper exam it affects these pupil's gcse results and they give me this vague bullshit markscheme fuckaqa.it gets moderated otherwise i would the mark scheme is vague enough that it wouldn't even feel unprofessional to do so henry the question was why might someone else not get the same results as you.it's a crock of shit the whole paper is.the paper doesn't test the kids it tests the teacher's understanding of game theory so much is left up to my discretion but thats the same accross the country so i have to mark bearing in mind that other teachers across the country will probably be lenient because they can be and because they are probably basing their marking on the idea that other teachers will be lenient but i have to balance that with the fact that the papers get moderated it's a fucking nightmare just give me a mark scheme that says this is right this is wrong.on marks schemes yes.henry the bible clearly states that the sky is a solid dome a firmament which was firm enough to separate waters above it from those below on the earth by noah's time it was still solid enough to have windows in it that had to be opened to let the rain through i think that false christians that spite on god's face by calling it poetic metaphor have given in to the godless materialists the bible really is literal in the true sense of the word the sky was a hard firmament with windows in it and anybody who says different is a mealy mouthed evolution sympathizer almost certainly a parody also evolutionists want to call those piddlin' changes evolution which just shows that they don't even know what the term means so we creationists have to tell them that evolution means apes popping out human babies you'd think them evil utionists'd have that straight by now.a parody but a hilarious one.o there's replies i haven't get there yet.i am pretty sure it is just loads of trolls trolling each other.wow i wonder if that happens at all in britain or america.whelp looks like i'm having nightmares tonight.tldr replacement for top gear steve coogan and rob brydon.nope we decided the coogan brydon combination with them both doing occasional impressions of clarkson would be brilliant..hehe.i think we have been to that gin place it's pricy but cool.has anyone here been to copenhagen what should we do there.any particular suggestions so far it is the niels bohr institute and a zoo.you know whats cool about three that i can use my data and text and minute allowance abroad for free.it is basically hamsterdam that was a hella interesting article i think we will go we will risk thr possible biker gangs grenades and full automatic rifles.if it's windy you should fly kites.hi ladies..creepy copenhagen goblin.finally an excuse at work.so its more of an excuse at bongos job then..who'd be interested in board games club various locations st sunday each month ♤♡♢♧..who is winning i better its cameron its easy to win when you promise stuff you'll never deliver i promise kittens puppies and free money vote owen.i wish fact checking happened in real time that would change everything.and a dong everytime someone made a promise they couldn't keep oh wait that already exists cameron.omg you need to hurry up season very soon.no it means he has a sense of humour that doesn't revolve around farting in a cockney accent.coz shaggy only understands the humour of long russian winters not long british rants.i love him he is the kind of funny i wish i could be silly and dry at the same time is so hard to pull of off.down by the corn exchange.bunn wins the labia party just thought i would add my sub par one to the mix.but a kid might see a woman urinate shaggy think of the children is no one thinking of the children.i think shaggy might be voting ukip guys.shotgun teaching that lesson.i'm perfect for the job not only have i had years teaching experience i also have an encyclopedic knowledge of porn boom see perfect for the job.it's a swingers party not a united kingdom independence party.just watched the debates right thats it i'm voting ukip can't have these foreign homos coming over here with all their super aids spreading all their super aids on all the surfaces foreign homos with thier super aids get 'em out send 'em back to homoland with their super aids let them rot in homoland if they have the audacity to be born in a country without a good healthcare system and an aids epidemic let them homo rot in their homo super aids the frogman has spoken.i am not sure anyone has the right to fight anyone else harry seems to think girls have fighting rights i am pretty sure they don't unless there is some blasted eu regulation get britain out so boys can punch girls again..the reason my head is turned like that is to hide the extra long side burn.second chunks that are the biggest spoilers.wow i just watched it who would have thought that snape is really the ghost of arya.bbq sauce you don't need to marrinade if you are using bbq sauce.could do it is easy to make though eliza might be able to tell you how her bbq sauce is saucegasmnic.mistake make your own its easy we can bring liquid smoke if you are missing that.oh yeah how'd it go.did you get asked what you greatest weakness was.and did you then answer i often get told i work too hard and well.i often chase other employees with a mallet oh sorry you wanted me to lie.i have been told that i am too generous a lover ladies wow that's mega creepy why would you answer that in an interview i bet he went away with the voice saying nailed it.to be fair that is such a pointlessly crap question for anything but a sales job it's basically the same as asking could you bull shit for us a bit please.i've not been asked it to be fair teaching interviews are pretty good you just teach a lesson and if you do well then the interview is just to make sure you aren't a complete loon is the correct answer i would.what time will someone actually be in at canning town last time me and eliza turned up at the designated time there was no one in.i'm going to make bbq sauce here.he should with a name like frank.bbq sauce is simmering atm.from where shagzilla we get on at canada water actually we will just continue on to shadwell and dlt dlr.bongo's marinade bongo's marinade.bbbongo.a bear walks into a bar he sits down and immediately mauls to death and devours the woman on the stool next to him he then calmly orders a beer bartender sorry we don't serve drug users in here bear but i don't do drugs bartender what about that barbitchyouate.oh god this is my worst nightmare.you'll pay for this in time actually i might use this against my more attention seeking pupils just start falsely attributing thier behaviour to others and praising them for it.ned starks ghost came back and ate off jofferys dead face it was amazing.it also turned out carl drogo and the dragon drogon were the same thing all along the clue was in the name.voteswap is awesome its a shame they don't have it for lib dems as well i have to vote lib dem in my stupid area even though i really don't want to.problem is that in this country with our stupid system you are very unlikely to get to vote who you want.and free bus passes for dogs angela.it's like watching the kang and kodos election.everyone just says what you want to hear and whoever gets into power we are all gonna be slaves to an alien race except in my analogy the alien race are the rich.what counts as capital expenditure dave.what is the reasoning behind not including it just because it is a one off.oh right like when i bought that yacht but it didn't affect my bank balance because i don't have to buy the yacht every year.i'm sorry jimena i was joking about milliband having free dog bus passes as far as i know anyway nigel farage only wants free dog passes for british dogs though all those german shepherds coming over here using our buses for free and don't get me started on chihuahuas direct quote from the ukip party conference.depends what you mean by happy i understand what capital expenditure is but it seems like bullshit to not include it somehow in the deficit like my yacht example capital expenditure will still increase country debt so i don't see how you can just inore it like why not just add a capital expenditure budget of trillion pounds and then just ignore it.i am a keynsian so i agree with extra capital spending i just think it is sneaky to not include it somehow.i know but if you are borrowing that should add to the deficit even if you offset it across years or something or however long their plan is.i get that but this whole deficit balancing task is being played off by both parties as a way of getting the country out of debt a bit so hiding the fact that you are increasing the debt even if you are balancing the deficit is disingenuous.also i would argue that capital expenditure in the case of a country is a reccuring cost just because it is being spent on one off projects doesn't mean another one off project won't come along in a year or two it isn't the same as me buying a house also even if you do treat it as the same as me buying a house when i buy a house i have to pay it back those repayments become part of my personal deficit the government will have to payback the money eventually too in whatever means inflation or otherwise.mortgage repayments are a personal deficit.thata true angela.thats good point.i think i have changed my mind.they could privatise it.this is what i worry about if we get another tory government.this election has just become about a fucking number.and the tories seem to value making that number zero over any othwr concern.david cameron blatantly talks like that when asked about his promises on things like youth unemployment his reply is always those promises weren't the important ones deficit reduction was he basically says i care about making this number zero over anything else including the people what irks me is that the media and the other main parties go along with this bullshit the tory party have very shrewdly changed the message so that this election has become about the one thing they actually did achive deficit reduction.labour and the lib dems should have been calling him on this and they haven't been so now its so ingrained that we don't get to discuss people anymore we have to discuss this fucking number and i don't even get to vote for a party that isn't buying into cameron bullshit because if i do that waxwork snake will get into power again i am fucking sick of it.he looks like a madame tusaauds puppet came alive and then somehow started running the country.i take it back the madame tussauds cameron looks more realistic becausr at least it has a moustache.not over people.the economy is also affected by youth unemployment.yeah but there are two ways to reduce a defict.you don't have to do it by spending less you can do it by raising more and the fact you didn't think of that first just shows how well the tories have manipulated the media and the other parties.that is nonsense though bongo its been shown time and time again not to be true.but you don't increase corporate tax you just increase income tax.no bongo lets cut public services instead especially any service aimed at the weak or poor.and the problem is that they won't cut health or education not that they should because that would lose them votes which means that small departments have to take the hit a cut to the nhs would be equivalent to a cut on another department.the nhs could survive a cut a little department can't survive a cut and still do what it does they kept saying that education was a protected area during the debates though those little areas are things like libraries which are really vital for poor people but that votera don't generally give a shit about.bn just not paid lol i wish i could get away with just not paying my tax.so dave was right and some for that year yes.interst bill is bn alone.after delving into this more wales is getting screwed they have of the uk population but only of its spending bull shit i am voting plaid cymru.scotland respectivel numbers are and so they didn't do so well either.let's take back australia they have barely any defense and loads of resources.yeah i'm not sure exactly what the numbers mean dave presumably they don't include education and health.ah ok the numbers i got must not have included health etc spending in wales under health not wales'.two economists are walking down the road and see a turd one says to the other i'll give you £ to eat that turd the other weighs up his options and decides eating it is the rational choice they keep walking and now the second one sees a turd he proposes the first eats it for £ the first makes the rational choice and eats it they keep walking for a bit and the first says wait a minute we both have as much money as we did before the walk but our mouths taste like shit the second replies yes but we increased our gdp by £ tldr yes bongo gdp is a pretty silly stat.i think how many times i mention my own name should be one i only do that during periods of growth actually mike you should graph that see if it is at all true.yep i liked that one goddamn it seriously i am scared that i am losing my identity.you chose a good time to get unemployed.find out maybe there's vote rigging afoot.so often i spend like an hour on reddit trying to decide which game i want to play and then just end up playing leagues anyway.you need months left on your passport though possibly we never got a confirmation of that from anyone and eliza went to the passport office.big data.dench vs hench.music people what is a good group to listen to while i program.i'm gonna go with the second one because it just seems like a string of random letters much like programming seems to me at the moment.it's hellish bongo i have since switched to shaggy's music which is lovely.yours sounded like a bag of spanners being hurled at another bag of cats with techno drums.hype bitches.me and eliza are in euston for the next hour.no euston makes sense..dave come.£.oh i thought you meant you were googling yourself.smart phones ruined arguments with shaggy they used to be so much fun but now i can prove him wrong in seconds.unfortunately so that time i rescued a baby from a burning building is overshadowed by a small egg mishap.hahahha thats great.sure wait £ thats an expensive cocktail i thought it was free.hi i'm owen i have syphilis and like long walks in the abattoir hi i'm bunn i am mainly looking for a someone to emotionally neglect and ignore except for sex hi i'm bongo insert witty comment about how this place is full of creeps step profit.to be fair if a girl did that to me that would be an instant win for her.swoon.nerdyness is kinda cool now though technology is in everyones pockets so not knowing how to use it is a bit meh when we were younger it was nerds that could do computer stuff because no one else really used them but now thats changed it's the new version of being

as fuck.what is the second one mike..nice.the counting lasted until about the next morning last time i will probably just wake up and pay attention to it during the day.let's make our own swingometer.release a pack of wild wolves into the pub and lock the doors the last person alive gets a free pint.you're right bongo let's replace the wolves with geese.anti hype go hung parliament that thing that was meant to happen if we voted av.to busy eating waffles amiright vote ukip.vote tactically.owen i'm planning a coup as we speak.raise my army teegs and i will make you chancellor.voting ew what kind of coup has an election at the end of it henry you can be chief whip.that was my idea i was going to dress you like indiana jones.i want mine too.i'm hoping this is the election when finally the lizard people reveal themselves and ship us to their moonbases it's been a long time coming....watch i for one welcome our new tombstone overlords on youtube https youtu be cpcbvwgok.i couldn't find that clip without some weird image plastered on top of it.how was the polling so wrong mike.it really probably doesn't make much difference milliband had bought into cameron's cut everything rhetoric anyway so even if he got into power we'd still have a bunch of cuts.we need someone like tony benn what happened to politicians like him.cameron's cut everything rhetoric milliband bought into it the debates between them were basically them just promising to cut everything except the nhs so if labour got in we'd also just have more austerity.we really need pr even if it does mean ukip get more seats facts like that just make a mockery of our fptp system.i didn't like how my moon lizard got removed so quickly.eat bbqed blue cheese only and blueberries.he shouldn't have sold his soul for a cameron reacharound and a referendum on a shit version of pr.joe.watch george osbourne wacky trip on youtube https youtu be tn wilsngg gotta respect a guy who turns up to parliament tripping balls.kenya nice.ride some lions for me.also me an eliza will definitely visit is it a permanent move.i'm free those days it's petes birthday as well.yep.over the past three years per cent of categories measured – which included people’s happiness with their work health material wellbeing relationships social support and local environment –had improved or shown no change.this is the kind of subtle propaganda that got cameron a majority that means of areas happiness went down it doesn't say how many showed no change so it could be happier no change and less happy fuck you independent.sorry the newspapers in general have been driving me nuts in the lead up to the election as soon as election season happens when the papera should try their best to be objective seems to be the time they decide to unashamedly just smear propaganda in your face no wonder cameron got a majority all but one of the major newspapers explicitly supported him.i don't have a problem with a happiness report just the way the independent covered it.in america money wins elections in britain newspapers win elections i'm not sure which i would prefer but they are both shit.however it's used i would rather have a happiness number used to measure progress than the deficit.blargh guys blargh i do not remember last night i think i was a bit of a buffoon though can anyone who was more sober than me offer any insight.i think i said some bad stuff.really.oh god arguing with emptiers is never a good idea.did i try kissing any of you i think i was in a particularly

is a tautology its either applicable or its not not or applicable lol nerd bants.that's what it's meant to be but the slash completely changes its meaning a slash normally means or e g male female so n a is almost like it's saying not or applicable which is nonsense or hilarious.i have seen w o i don't think i have seen w.thats silly but i am pretty sure you are correct i just didn't want to look like an idiot writing kids reports with n a in them.oh i see n a means not divided by applicable.except in the case where it's not.haha i love that cartoon.the only thing missing is that the plane then crashes into london killing thousands gove was worse than incompetent he was anti competent if he was incompetent then nothing would have been done he actively tried his best to put the education

are all really nice kids though.the email didn't say but if they have left it this late i think they'll be happy with anything i think the idea is that it's shadowing some professional person.that's a pretty good idea but i'm pretty sure the idea is that unless you go to private school you have to learn to serve others work experience is there to show kids not to aspire to capital and instead to resign themselves to the fact that their labour is owned by the bourgeoisie the persuit of capital is only for posh people.you could design us a stamp set.jimena has bongo not told you about our

because they only looked at directly attributable financially measurable externalities.here's the breakdown dave it's mainly externalities the article did this annoying thing of calling them both
