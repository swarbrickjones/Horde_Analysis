04/08/2014, 11:41 - Dave: Whoop!
04/08/2014, 11:57 - Sam Roberts: That means it's done
04/08/2014, 12:23 - Alex Bunn: Eat it
04/08/2014, 12:24 - Alex Bunn: Good Saturday Shaggy drinks everyone x
04/08/2014, 12:37 - Phil: Eat it before it turns the neighbouring plants red. Domino effect is a Bitch.

05/08/2014, 20:46 - Sam Roberts: Anyone watching the debate? I need to educate myself!
05/08/2014, 20:51 - Tegan: Can you record it? Does that still happen?
05/08/2014, 20:51 - Angela: What debate is this?
05/08/2014, 20:52 - Tegan: Or could iplayer it later in the week?  Would be happy to join you to yaahboo at Alex Salmond
05/08/2014, 20:52 - Dave: The summary is that salmond will say lots of optimistic things and darling will say lots of pessimistic things (despite his name).
05/08/2014, 20:52 - Dave: It will be unclear who is right
05/08/2014, 20:53 - Dave: End result will depend on whether you are optimistic or not
06/08/2014, 12:35 - Sam Roberts: Good debate, felt a lot more like opinions backed by facts, and less like rabble rousing rhetoric than I was expecting
06/08/2014, 12:35 - Sam Roberts: Just saw this a week, guess who made their own outfit from a bin bag
06/08/2014, 12:35 - Sam Roberts: <Media omitted>

08/08/2014, 10:22 - Shaggy: Óêí that's so awesome
08/08/2014, 10:24 - Alex Bunn: Lol
08/08/2014, 10:42 - Tegan: Yaaaay!
08/08/2014, 10:43 - Angela: He's dead now.
08/08/2014, 10:48 - Shaggy: Because you ate him?
08/08/2014, 11:00 - Angela: Yeah, poor little guy didn't stand a chance
08/08/2014, 11:00 - Angela: Far too tasty looking
08/08/2014, 11:18 - Alex Bunn: Thats what gets for being sad/happy on a friday
08/08/2014, 11:33 - Krizia: Hahahaha happyyy üéäüéäÓåíÓåí Friday!!!
08/08/2014, 11:33 - Krizia: I don't want to get eaten ;)
08/08/2014, 14:45 - Shaggy: Someone died from e cigarette exploding, they are bound to make them illegal now
08/08/2014, 14:46 - Henry Dranks: laaame I love my ecig
08/08/2014, 14:46 - Tegan: A few people have set on fire already
08/08/2014, 14:47 - Tegan: I imagine it will be hard to stop people ordering them from China,  which is where they all seem to come from anyway
08/08/2014, 14:47 - Henry Dranks: tbh mine gets really sodding hot im not surprised theyre combusting
08/08/2014, 14:48 - Angela: Technically he was killed by his oxygen tank exploding
08/08/2014, 14:48 - Angela: Set off by the eecigarette
08/08/2014, 14:48 - Tegan: Was he under water?
08/08/2014, 14:48 - Angela: So you're probably ok unless you're carting one of those around, in which case you're not that ok to begin with
08/08/2014, 14:48 - Shaggy: That's circumstantial, e cigarettes are the real #terrorists here
08/08/2014, 14:49 - Angela: I'm guessing he had some kind of smoking related illness - how ironic
08/08/2014, 14:50 - Shaggy: To have lung cancer and die from explosion?
08/08/2014, 14:50 - Shaggy: At least he can laugh in the face of cancer
08/08/2014, 14:51 - Henry Dranks: id rather die explosively than cancerously tbh
08/08/2014, 14:51 - Shaggy: That's ambiguous. Explosive diarrhoea is not a nice way to go
08/08/2014, 14:53 - Henry Dranks: depends just how explosive surely. I mean, if your digestive system straight up vaporises you it wouldnt be too bad
08/08/2014, 14:53 - Angela: It'd be bad for whoever finds you
08/08/2014, 14:54 - Angela: Vaporised by poo
08/08/2014, 15:16 - Tegan: Ye gods
08/08/2014, 15:16 - Tegan: Is it possible?
08/08/2014, 15:46 - Shaggy: Yup, lookup pooverization
08/08/2014, 15:47 - Shaggy: In fact this is where the word poverty is desired from, literally meaning bathing in own shit
08/08/2014, 15:49 - Henry Dranks: haha pooverisation love it
08/08/2014, 15:49 - Henry Dranks: not to be confused with hooverisation, wherein the victim is slowly pulled inside a dyson
08/08/2014, 15:55 - Shaggy: If anyone is interested in etymology, the term was invented by dyson on Hoover dam, and has nothing to do with hoovers, which are not powerful enough for that particular form of homicide
08/08/2014, 15:55 - Tegan: Or shoeverisation, where the victim is beaten to death with his own shoes...
08/08/2014, 15:55 - Tegan: Good Fridaying, everyone x
08/08/2014, 16:02 - Mike SJ: Lol
08/08/2014, 16:02 - Mike SJ: Poo

08/08/2014, 17:19 - Bongo: Staying at home programming all night long
08/08/2014, 17:19 - Tegan: Boat trip still on for tomorrow if you require payback/greenery

08/08/2014, 17:26 - Krizia: Or else I probably follow the best drinking team in a bit! !
08/08/2014, 17:27 - Tegan: True. Perhaps I should travel through letterland..
08/08/2014, 17:37 - Sam Roberts: Beers. Haven't decided where, probably due Kritzwards unless there's a better offer... Mike?
08/08/2014, 18:28 - Dave: I'm looking for drinking partners in or around the south Kensington area. Anyone?

19/08/2014, 16:24 - Bongo: Just talked to a guy called William Y Wang
19/08/2014, 16:25 - Bongo: I'm hoping he's used to people not being able to keep a straight face while talking to him
19/08/2014, 16:36 - Tegan: Why indeed?
19/08/2014, 16:36 - Tegan: Tee hee hee
19/08/2014, 16:46 - Shaggy: BillY Wang

19/08/2014, 17:49 - Mike SJ: First name Wing
19/08/2014, 17:59 - Sam Roberts: My sister had a school friend called Richard Dicks. I guess his parents were just bad people
19/08/2014, 18:03 - Lorna: Two mathematicians I know: dong Wang and jumbo wang
19/08/2014, 18:05 - Lorna: There should be a support group for people whose names mean penis
19/08/2014, 18:07 - Mike SJ: You can't not succeed in life with a name like Jumbo Wang
19/08/2014, 18:08 - Hannah Murphy: A lot of pressure on you in the bedroom I would expect
19/08/2014, 18:08 - Hannah Murphy: Stressful
19/08/2014, 18:09 - Sam Roberts: It's a big name to live up to
19/08/2014, 18:23 - Alex Bunn: Now thats a name i couldnt restrain myself from laughing at

19/08/2014, 19:06 - Dave: Explain tom yum soup
19/08/2014, 19:06 - Angela: Exactly how it sounds, tasty dyke broth
19/08/2014, 19:08 - Angela: Thai has a letter in between d and t, which is used for tom yum soup. So it's a bit different
19/08/2014, 19:32 - Owen: I teach a kid called dong hung. I bet he doesn't get picked on because he can always use the "dong hung by name dong hung by nature" comeback.
19/08/2014, 22:15 - Bongo: Lol I remember xxx! We cracked up so much when we saw it, think we were massively high or something

20/08/2014, 16:26 - Alex Bunn: One off
20/08/2014, 16:28 - Sam Roberts: I'll just get new flights. Worth it if the gig's free
20/08/2014, 16:29 - Alex Bunn: Having fun out there?
20/08/2014, 16:29 - Alex Bunn: Chickened out of the marathon yet?
20/08/2014, 16:30 - Sam Roberts: Yeah it's cool, super healthy family fun so far, triathlon on Sunday
20/08/2014, 16:30 - Sam Roberts: I figure I'll splash around in the pool a bit then watch the ladies event
20/08/2014, 16:33 - Phil: Does the ladies triathlon include mud wrestling instead of biking?
20/08/2014, 16:44 - Tegan: Is that distance mud wrestling?
20/08/2014, 16:56 - Sam Roberts: With a strict 2 items or less policy on clothing
20/08/2014, 16:58 - Mike SJ: I would choose kigu
20/08/2014, 16:58 - Mike SJ: And another kigu to go on top of that kigu

20/08/2014, 16:59 - Sam Roberts: Haha
20/08/2014, 17:00 - Sam Roberts: But that's why you'll never win the Seattle women's triathlon
20/08/2014, 17:01 - Tegan: You could sell that kigu, no question
20/08/2014, 17:01 - Tegan: Maybe big data ain't your game
20/08/2014, 17:03 - Mike SJ: Big Kigu experience totally going on my CV
20/08/2014, 17:05 - Tegan: Nol

20/08/2014, 19:19 - Dave: Hmm, the part of me that is optimistic about mankind is in tension with the part of me that wants beer.
20/08/2014, 19:19 - Phil: I downloaded a film that looks 100% eighties and 300% disgusting.

01/09/2014, 18:49 - Shaggy: If you like turkish cuisine I strongly recommend tas, it's pretty cheap and mighty tasty. If you want tapas then brindisa is really good, it's moderately priced. If you want a more pub-like atmosphere the George has excellent chefs too
01/09/2014, 19:41 - Lora: Brindisa is expensive and always too crowded, long wait. I always love me a good vapiano!
01/09/2014, 22:58 - Bongo: I thought you said it was Friday henners, or is that something else
01/09/2014, 22:58 - Henry Dranks: I did, I was wrong

05/09/2014, 20:40 - Owen: I believe bongo was relaying the information that a fine gangsta named shorty is able to fire a shot gun proficiently but only if he is in less affluent neighbourhoods.
05/09/2014, 20:41 - Dan Sluckin: (After the 'incident')

05/09/2014, 21:25 - Owen: I am a slow loris
I live in a forest
Eating bugs makes my day
Detroit what'd ya say?
05/09/2014, 21:26 - Owen: I pull out my gat
And with a ratatat tat
Five slugs in your belly
Makes tupac jelly.
05/09/2014, 21:29 - Owen: When I left compton town
The crime rate went down
Like sam's mom on peter kay
Thats g life; O-K?

05/09/2014, 21:33 - Tegan: Where did V go?
05/09/2014, 21:37 - Owen: Let's have a word for Mike swarbrick.
He wears the badge of a law dick.
Takes names: 'your nicked'
His mom takes the dicks of four tricks!
05/09/2014, 21:38 - Tegan: Niiiiiice intro
05/09/2014, 21:48 - Owen: Whatup tegan palmer
Voice like a farmer.
Herder of llama.
Wearer of armour.

Yeah I know, that's not so good.
But it ain't bad for a guy from the hood.
I'll stop and continue you should.
While I pause and eat my pud.
05/09/2014, 21:52 - Dan Sluckin: O, your rhymes are so reckless,
We'll show you up as a ludicrous,
feckless, slow loris.
Less ability than Boris...
Johnson at rapping,
caught you napping, prattling
about other's mothers,
but yours ain't getting no thinner,
Time to shut up and eat your dinner.
05/09/2014, 21:53 - Shaggy: I like your rhymes but they're not quite mature, think for a bit and then when you're sure hit back, with rhyme that ain't whack, rhyme that will make me take smack, rhyme that will me take crack, crack my back, whack the smack and all that, sure
05/09/2014, 21:53 - Owen: Reckless and ludicrous rhyme in no way at all.

Other than that.  It was pretty good.
05/09/2014, 21:55 - Shaggy: Dan your rhymes rule, you've studied the school of cool, they literally make drool. You ain't no fool! Like poor O
05/09/2014, 22:04 - Dan Sluckin: I don't need no rhyming dictionary using critic,
The links and perfect timing, work when I just hit it.
If you read the flow like my man Shaggage
You'll find no space for baggage:
Ludicrous, said like the rapper, entrepreneur and actor
rhymes with reckless and is a determining factor,
In your freestyling downfall,
Your mind is so small,
I await your next reply, so
Alex Trofymenko,
Can just show
How its done yo.
05/09/2014, 22:04 - Dan Sluckin: Or alternatively teegz
Because I just want to play leagues...
05/09/2014, 22:14 - Owen: Ok I guess I have to play leagues now. That was excellent.

05/09/2014, 22:17 - Shaggy: That was hands down winner. I bow to dan "the rhyme buster" Ruddick.

10/09/2014, 09:36 - Owen: There is a quote from someone clever. "Alcohol steals happiness from the day after"
No truer words have ever been said.
10/09/2014, 11:47 - Mike SJ: The solution is clear : get twice as drunk right now to get back to where you were last night
10/09/2014, 12:50 - Vanessa: <Media omitted>
10/09/2014, 13:55 - Hannah Murphy: You can't catch me

11/09/2014, 12:15 - Angela: Looks interesting, afraid I probably can't tonight, I have as yet undefined plans. If the plans continue to be undefined for the next few hours I would be up for joining you!
11/09/2014, 12:43 - Phil: That is a hell of a polite way to say "I'll meet you if I can't think of anything better to do"
11/09/2014, 12:47 - Tegan: Ha
11/09/2014, 12:48 - Angela: Well my friend is visiting from America but she's had a 24 hour journey... So maybe I should say if she sleeps all day and doesn't call me then I will join you!
11/09/2014, 13:21 - Sam Roberts: Think I'm going there with daddio this weekend, let me know how it is!

11/09/2014, 15:28 - Hannah Murphy: If anyone fancies
11/09/2014, 16:38 - Lorna: I went to the wellcome thing. It's aight, quite small. Play the high tea opium trade computer game. I got too involved with the opium, didn't ship enough tea.

11/09/2014, 19:47 - Hannah Murphy: What just happened
11/09/2014, 20:00 - Alex Bunn: Sam and kriz miscommunications
11/09/2014, 20:00 - Alex Bunn: Go back to sleep
11/09/2014, 20:01 - Sam Roberts: I had no hands in that
11/09/2014, 20:01 - Sam Roberts: Y'all welcome to come for a pint though, take the edge off these spickadees
11/09/2014, 20:02 - Alex Bunn: Already at home bro
12/09/2014, 12:57 - Mike SJ: TIL: George Foreman has 5 sons called George, George, George, George and George
12/09/2014, 12:57 - Mike SJ: And a daughter called Georgetta
12/09/2014, 13:00 - Sam Roberts: That's nuts
12/09/2014, 13:00 - Sam Roberts: And a great Wikipedia read
12/09/2014, 13:01 - Joe Jarman: Must get confusing at Christmas
12/09/2014, 13:01 - Joe Jarman: Do they have nicknames
12/09/2014, 13:01 - Joe Jarman: I bet he just gets them all an updated version of his grill anyway
12/09/2014, 13:09 - Mike SJ: Lol
12/09/2014, 13:11 - Mike SJ: I like that he turned down Georgia, Georgie, Georgina for Georgetta!
12/09/2014, 13:11 - Mike SJ: Probly cause they don't keep the George intact
12/09/2014, 13:13 - Tegan: Roman numerals are always a stately option
12/09/2014, 13:13 - Sam Roberts: Think it's a cultural thing?, or he just really really loves himself?
12/09/2014, 13:14 - Sam Roberts: <Media omitted>
12/09/2014, 13:15 - Mike SJ: I read somewhere he convinced his wife to do it because he's shit at remembering names
12/09/2014, 13:15 - Mike SJ: What with the marbles he lost boxing
12/09/2014, 13:34 - Angela: Maybe he's just passing on his greatest legacy. The name of an amazing piece of kitchenware. Being called george Forman must open a lot of doors in life
12/09/2014, 13:35 - Mike SJ: His sons should change the name to George Fiveman
12/09/2014, 13:43 - Sam Roberts: Would you rather fight one George Fiveman sized George Foreman, or four George Foreman sized George Fivemans?
12/09/2014, 13:43 - Mike SJ: That's a question philosophers will be asking for many years to come I imagine Sam

12/09/2014, 14:31 - Hannah Murphy: When you start to write names in fb, it tries to auto-tag
12/09/2014, 14:32 - Joe Jarman: Does grandmaster flash have to be a page they've liked?
12/09/2014, 14:33 - Hannah Murphy: Nah it's just started making any old suggestions closest to what you're writing
12/09/2014, 14:33 - Hannah Murphy: Or perhaps old nana's just love the flashster
12/09/2014, 14:35 - Alex Bunn: Maybe thats what old people are calling themselves these days
12/09/2014, 14:35 - Alex Bunn: Its hard to keep up with trends
12/09/2014, 14:36 - Shaggy: I showed it to work peeps, they're tweeting it

13/09/2014, 09:46 - Angela: What happened?!?!
13/09/2014, 09:46 - Angela: And what is that crazy spirit!!
13/09/2014, 09:50 - Shaggy: Drunken cycling again
13/09/2014, 09:59 - Owen: I think we should put a breathalyser on mikes bike that only lets him ride if he is below 4 times the legal limit.
13/09/2014, 10:23 - Phil: How will he get to work then?
13/09/2014, 11:27 - Bongo: Lol that's pretty funny

13/09/2014, 19:24 - Tegan: Wellcome is sweet, the exhibition is small, but the permanent exhibition is also worth a look
13/09/2014, 19:24 - Tegan: In the vacinity of the cider tap aswell, which is a home away from home for a West Country man
13/09/2014, 19:50 - Sam Roberts: Cider specific? The Roberts clan has never been too apple-centric
13/09/2014, 19:50 - Sam Roberts: Top tip though, cheers
13/09/2014, 19:51 - Dave: It's all cider but it has a beery brother over the road
13/09/2014, 19:54 - Sam Roberts: Sounds like a winning recipe for a powerful hangover, can't wait
13/09/2014, 19:58 - Tegan: The beer version is the Euston tap- it's much busier, with much more liklihood of having to stand on the pavement
13/09/2014, 20:15 - Tegan: <Media omitted>
13/09/2014, 20:15 - Tegan: Eric Cantona. 1987

14/09/2014, 10:57 - Tegan: Mmmmm
14/09/2014, 10:58 - Tegan: Shall we do something else instead of brunch?
14/09/2014, 11:01 - Joe Jarman: Fry up
14/09/2014, 14:09 - Tegan: The time for fry ups may have passed
14/09/2014, 14:09 - Tegan: But if anyone fancies coming round for a beer and a board game you'd be more than welcome
14/09/2014, 14:32 - Tegan: Or out for a roast later?
14/09/2014, 14:32 - Tegan: Options
14/09/2014, 14:34 - Joe Jarman: Flint knapping in stoke Newington is an option
14/09/2014, 14:52 - Lorna: I was going to head to the old blue last later on, for some jazzy live music. Its free, and round the corner (from me at least)
14/09/2014, 14:57 - Tegan: Both sound intriguing
14/09/2014, 14:57 - Tegan: Will you be stripping out the copper as well, Joe?
14/09/2014, 16:54 - Tegan: (Have since looked up what flint knapping is- looks like fun)

15/09/2014, 16:57 - Adimina: <Media omitted>

15/09/2014, 17:08 - Adimina: And by "boarding soon" I mean "my plane is on another city and delayed an hour"
15/09/2014, 20:55 - Adimina: ÓÄùÓÄéÓÑº
15/09/2014, 21:20 - Alex Bunn: Have you got to London yet?

16/09/2014, 13:29 - Sam Roberts: I think it gets busier though, let me see if dreas is up for it

16/09/2014, 13:32 - Adimina: Ah, gotta be in North London for 8 so I'll pass. But keen for a cling sometime
16/09/2014, 17:27 - Sam Roberts: Going to the usual place just now, if you fancy a Bermondsey climb I'll be there in 30 mins or so
16/09/2014, 19:18 - Adimina: Do I got a bit excited and tie dyed a dress... So of anyone needs to dye anything green our blue there is some outside... I'll be back later tonight to dispose of it if not
16/09/2014, 20:17 - Sam Roberts: Let's tie dye all Bunns pants, he loves hippy stuff like that
16/09/2014, 20:18 - Adimina: Or his work shirts?
16/09/2014, 20:18 - Sam Roberts: Even better! He's in the green division, guaranteed promotion
16/09/2014, 20:27 - Dave: Don't forget his hats...he hates that they're not all green
16/09/2014, 20:32 - Adimina: Oh, and his undies
16/09/2014, 20:33 - Dave: You always have to turn a serious conversation into something silly don't you...
16/09/2014, 20:36 - Adimina: I am dead serious. If Bunn doesn't have all green undies then he's not a real man
16/09/2014, 20:37 - Dave: Well as long as you're serious! Shame you don't have yellow dye, could get a teenage mutant teenage turtle theme going

17/09/2014, 19:13 - Bongo: Lol I won't blame you if you leave, I'd rather be water boarded than bored
17/09/2014, 19:15 - Tegan: 13 minute walk from here
17/09/2014, 19:26 - Bongo: Just got here if anyone's around
17/09/2014, 19:27 - Bongo: The pints are on me

17/09/2014, 19:48 - Alex Bunn: Yeah i went home
17/09/2014, 19:56 - Sam Roberts: Just tubing from Euston, the anchor still aye?
17/09/2014, 20:21 - Bongo: Aye
17/09/2014, 22:27 - Tegan: Owen owen owen, what was the pretty building game for phones you talked about, with the building interaction and such?
17/09/2014, 22:38 - Owen: ?
17/09/2014, 22:39 - Tegan: I need a game
17/09/2014, 22:39 - Tegan: You mentioned you were playing one
17/09/2014, 22:39 - Tegan: A building game
17/09/2014, 22:40 - Tegan: Where rabbits interact work blueberries and the like
17/09/2014, 22:40 - Owen: Terrestial?
17/09/2014, 22:40 - Owen: Ohhhh
17/09/2014, 22:40 - Owen: That's not a phone game
17/09/2014, 22:40 - Owen: Reus.
17/09/2014, 22:40 - Tegan: Bum
17/09/2014, 22:40 - Owen: It's really good.
17/09/2014, 22:40 - Tegan: I only need a phone game
17/09/2014, 22:41 - Owen: I am learning android to make a phone game with similar ideas.
17/09/2014, 22:41 - Owen: What kind of phone game?
17/09/2014, 22:43 - Tegan: A building game
17/09/2014, 22:43 - Tegan: With pretty
17/09/2014, 22:43 - Tegan: All crowd sourced suggestions welcome
17/09/2014, 22:47 - Sam Roberts: Terraria. Best game ever
17/09/2014, 23:09 - Owen: There aren't  many good phone  building  games.
17/09/2014, 23:09 - Sam Roberts: Ooh xconstructor
17/09/2014, 23:10 - Owen: Tiny tower was pretty addictive but it was one of those stupid wait  4 hours for something to  finish.
17/09/2014, 23:10 - Sam Roberts: Not sure if it's on iPhone, but it's awesome
17/09/2014, 23:10 - Owen: X constructor?
17/09/2014, 23:10 - Owen: That sounds good. What is it?
17/09/2014, 23:10 - Sam Roberts: I think that's it, where you build railway bridges and trains go over them
17/09/2014, 23:11 - Sam Roberts: But if you build them badly, everyone dies
17/09/2014, 23:18 - Owen: Nice
17/09/2014, 23:34 - Joe Jarman: Hey Owen how good with android are you
17/09/2014, 23:34 - Joe Jarman: I'm starting a coursesa course in a few days
17/09/2014, 23:35 - Joe Jarman: Looking for others interested
17/09/2014, 23:35 - Joe Jarman: Also I've been messing about with unity as well
18/09/2014, 00:24 - Owen: I'm about 1/4 of the way through my book. I have got the basics and am now using fragments. It's a pretty neat setup. Very scalable, but that means that you have to do quite a lot for even the simplest app. Fortunately android released a development  kit pre bundled with eclipse which takes away loads of the legwork  that existed when android was first  released. I haven't  looked into unity, mainly because I don't have an apple. What's  it like?
18/09/2014, 09:01 - Mike SJ: What's the predictions for Scotland vote then?
18/09/2014, 09:01 - Angela: I think it'll be a no, what do you think?
18/09/2014, 09:02 - Mike SJ: I reckon no too, morbidly curious to see a yes vote though...
18/09/2014, 09:02 - Angela: I didn't think I was bothered but actually I would be a bit sad if they voted yes
18/09/2014, 09:03 - Angela: Like being dumped by someone I completely took for granted all these years
18/09/2014, 09:03 - Mike SJ: Lol
18/09/2014, 09:03 - Mike SJ: And all those cyclists. Damn
18/09/2014, 09:04 - Mike SJ: 55% no, that's my bet
18/09/2014, 09:05 - Sam Roberts: Cyclists?
18/09/2014, 09:06 - Martha: Reckon 52% no - a bit too close for comfort
18/09/2014, 09:06 - Sam Roberts: I'm not sure I care about the really. The important thing is it sets the stage for Cornish independence, which is way overdue
18/09/2014, 09:07 - Sam Roberts: *result
18/09/2014, 09:07 - Sam Roberts: They actually have their own currency, take that Scotland
18/09/2014, 09:08 - Mike SJ: Yeah think about all those gold medals we got in the cycling!
18/09/2014, 09:08 - Mike SJ: I reckon no's are underreporting. I'd be surprised by a yes vote
18/09/2014, 09:13 - Angela: I agree, I think 55% at least for no
18/09/2014, 09:18 - Dave: I think I would be happy either way: excited for an independent Scotland, content to see an island united.
18/09/2014, 09:20 - Dave: The underreporting point is true though the polls may not be very reliable. There was a chap from yougov on the radio the other day saying that polls are usually weighted to control for the way they are sampled however this process requires historical data
18/09/2014, 09:20 - Mike SJ: There's no exit polls! Bullshit, where's the fun in that?
18/09/2014, 09:20 - Dave: There isn't any such data for this referendum but the weighting process has been done anyway which can skew the results
18/09/2014, 09:24 - Joe Jarman: Ungrateful Scots costing us a fortune yes or no, best just to cull the lot of em. Off to collect my dole money ÓêÖ
18/09/2014, 09:25 - Mike SJ: You know betfair have already paid out on no? Thats pretty cocky...
18/09/2014, 09:26 - Angela: While they weight the results for sampling, they can't weight them for people lying. All the polls in 1992 predicted a labour win but it turned out that voting conservative was so uncool that people just didn't want to admit to it
18/09/2014, 09:26 - Dave: What happens if it's yes? Do they have to return the money?
18/09/2014, 09:27 - Angela: Probably voting no is seen as boring but actually people do want the safer option?
18/09/2014, 09:28 - Alex Bunn: I'm for a yes vote
18/09/2014, 09:28 - Dave: Maybe, bit I wonder how many people, when in the ballot box, will let the excitement take over and change to yes
18/09/2014, 09:28 - Alex Bunn: I bet they could have a more progressive country if they cut London loose
18/09/2014, 09:31 - Alex Bunn: Great Britain is renamed, not-so-great-anymore Britain
18/09/2014, 09:32 - Krizia: I think the contrary actually happens in the ballot box a lot of people take the safe option or they change right there!
18/09/2014, 09:32 - Alex Bunn: Not-as-united as before Kindom
18/09/2014, 09:33 - Krizia: I can't wait for this to be over! !! its boring at work all is Scott here there! ! Common
18/09/2014, 09:43 - Sam Roberts: They'll all be deported tomorrow, it'll be a lonely Friday for you!
18/09/2014, 09:49 - Krizia: Hehe well if I had a vote I would say yes!!! Let's start a revolution just for the sake of it!!
18/09/2014, 09:54 - Alex Bunn: Thats the spirit!
18/09/2014, 09:56 - Dave: Yay!
18/09/2014, 09:57 - Adimina: If the Scots leave then soon enough we'll have Wales and the rest of Ireland jumping ship too
18/09/2014, 09:57 - Adimina: Then well just be "Britain"
18/09/2014, 09:57 - Alex Bunn: Wales and Ireland dont have any oil
18/09/2014, 09:59 - Alex Bunn: But i would quite like to see Wales go it alone
18/09/2014, 09:59 - Alex Bunn: They could export loveliness
18/09/2014, 10:05 - Mike SJ: Let's have a London referendum! Fuck everyone else!
18/09/2014, 10:05 - Mike SJ: Except Hatfield
18/09/2014, 10:07 - Owen: I hope it is a yes. That would be an awesome experiment.
18/09/2014, 10:08 - Owen: One that we can observe but that really doesn't  affect us much.
18/09/2014, 10:08 - Sam Roberts: Whisky prices will go up
18/09/2014, 10:08 - Sam Roberts: It's the only effect on my life I can think of
18/09/2014, 10:10 - Mike SJ: Gold medals in cycling will plummet
18/09/2014, 10:11 - Vanessa: England is starting to produce some good whiskey
18/09/2014, 10:11 - Mike SJ: People keep ignoring the big issues
18/09/2014, 10:11 - Mike SJ: Do we still get to claim someone from the uk won Wimbledon?
18/09/2014, 10:12 - Owen: Will they? That depends on  a lot of factors: Import  and export tax between England and Scotland, whether the new scoring government  decides to subsidise whiskey, EU trade rules.
18/09/2014, 10:14 - Sam Roberts: It won't go down
18/09/2014, 10:14 - Mike SJ: It also depends on whether we decide to put Hadrian's wall back up
18/09/2014, 10:14 - Sam Roberts: We're only losing Hoy, and without the superior british bikes and training, he'll dwindle to a hollowed has been
18/09/2014, 10:21 - Alex Bunn: He'll dwindle to a hollowed has been anyway
18/09/2014, 10:21 - Alex Bunn: Ha!
18/09/2014, 10:21 - Alex Bunn: Ageing
18/09/2014, 10:22 - Alex Bunn: I think claiming Andy Murray as our own has been a gigantic push for Scottish independence
18/09/2014, 10:24 - Owen: It could go down sam. It is a big industry. Wouldn't be suprised if a Scotland in charge of thier own economy decide to subsidise it loads. That coupled with EU trade laws would mean no export tax to Britain.
18/09/2014, 10:24 - Owen: France subsidise thier wine industry considerably.

24/09/2014, 21:45 - Adimina: Haha sweet. Coming
25/09/2014, 06:45 - Mike SJ: <Media omitted>
25/09/2014, 10:18 - Adimina: Hey c-towners. Where is this cheap racist hairdresser I can go to for a short back and sides
25/09/2014, 10:19 - Shaggy: I think you should grow a mullet
25/09/2014, 10:23 - Adimina: That is an option...
25/09/2014, 10:48 - Mike SJ: Peter's. He may also be sexist in which case you'll have to pretend to be a guy
25/09/2014, 10:50 - Mike SJ: He's really crap btw, I just go there out of habit now
25/09/2014, 10:54 - Adimina: Haha... I do look a bit like a boy
25/09/2014, 10:54 - Adimina: How can you mess up short back and sides though?
25/09/2014, 10:56 - Owen: By doing long back and sides instead.
25/09/2014, 10:56 - Owen: Like a monk.
25/09/2014, 11:00 - Mike SJ: One time he forgot to cut one of the sides, and I had to remind him
25/09/2014, 11:03 - Adimina: Hahaha
25/09/2014, 11:03 - Tegan: Lol
25/09/2014, 11:27 - Owen: A kid just dislocated his knee. On my break duty!
25/09/2014, 11:38 - Vanessa: Just pop it in place
25/09/2014, 11:38 - Owen: Instructions unclear. Now he has two dislocated knees.
25/09/2014, 11:39 - Vanessa: Now you can call for an ambulance
25/09/2014, 11:40 - Owen: Instructions unclear. Now he has an ambulance stuck under his kneecap.
25/09/2014, 11:45 - Shaggy: Get off your phone and help the damn kid
25/09/2014, 11:45 - Owen: Instructions unclear. Now my phone is duct taped to his forehead!
25/09/2014, 12:43 - Bongo: Skirt size linked to breast cancer?!
25/09/2014, 12:44 - Bongo: I've seriously had enough of bbc news
25/09/2014, 12:48 - Owen: Wait shorter or longer?
25/09/2014, 12:49 - Owen: Shorter skirt size linked to breast cancer - Christian union says.

Long skirt size linked to breast cancer - playboy magazine says.
25/09/2014, 12:49 - Owen: One might begin to question thier motivations.
25/09/2014, 12:50 - Tegan: Ha
25/09/2014, 12:50 - Owen: Also if it's long skirts that cause breast cancer does that mean we can stop victim blaming when a woman in a short skirt gets raped because she was just trying to protect herself from cancer.
25/09/2014, 12:51 - Tegan: I think they mean skirt size causes cancer.
25/09/2014, 12:54 - Owen: It's like the people who do these studies have never heard of comorbidity.
25/09/2014, 12:55 - Angela: So if I wear jeans? No cancer?
25/09/2014, 12:55 - Tegan: Solved!
25/09/2014, 12:55 - Angela: Wait... Jean skirts though
25/09/2014, 12:55 - Angela: No jean skirts
25/09/2014, 12:56 - Dave: Which way round is the correlation? Should I wear skirts?
25/09/2014, 12:57 - Tegan: Perhaps you should do a pamphlet
25/09/2014, 12:57 - Tegan: But not wearing skirts doesn't stop you have a skirt size
25/09/2014, 12:57 - Tegan: So yes dave
25/09/2014, 12:57 - Tegan: You should
25/09/2014, 12:57 - Joe Jarman: Why isn't it bum size linked to breast cancer
25/09/2014, 12:58 - Owen: The skirt doesn't even cover the breasts!  How the hell would it cause them to get cancer!
25/09/2014, 12:58 - Joe Jarman: Although I imagine there is some seriously positive correlation with bum size and boob size
25/09/2014, 13:00 - Bongo: I reckon we should all just go naked from the waist down to avoid looking stupid
25/09/2014, 13:02 - Joe Jarman: Naaaah waist up, nobody wants to see that bongo, put it away!
25/09/2014, 13:04 - Owen: Wait. So a size 8 is less likely to get cancer than a size 14. Why don't they just say people who are larger are generally less healthy. The skirt thing is irrelevant!!!
25/09/2014, 13:09 - Vanessa: I'm not sure where they got the correlation of waist size for breast cancer. But there is a definite relation between waist size and heart disease, which is not a cancer
25/09/2014, 13:09 - Vanessa: I just read the article and it's pretty poorly written
25/09/2014, 13:48 - Alex Bunn: Pints in the george tonight?
25/09/2014, 13:56 - Dave: Doig! Not sure. What's the occasion?
25/09/2014, 14:13 - Shaggy: Going to that gig in angel tonight
25/09/2014, 14:23 - Alex Bunn: Thursday is the occassion
25/09/2014, 15:02 - Tegan: Can't celebrate Thursday this week
25/09/2014, 15:02 - Tegan: Enjoy it though!
25/09/2014, 16:10 - Shaggy: Who's going to metalworks? Drinks/food beforehand?
25/09/2014, 16:55 - Vanessa: Me
25/09/2014, 17:04 - Sam Roberts: I am! Got me n Addy on the app yesterday
25/09/2014, 17:06 - Vanessa: Did you receive an email?

25/09/2014, 18:01 - Sam Roberts: Not even bullshitting, that's mission control
25/09/2014, 18:01 - Shaggy: Don't know if it does pizza but it definitely does beer
25/09/2014, 18:02 - Sam Roberts: Pubs called the arc, good pizza, but expensive though, there's the spoons if one fancy turns up?
25/09/2014, 18:02 - Vanessa: I'm making my way so just let me know which one you guys decide
25/09/2014, 18:13 - Shaggy: I'll be there in 15
25/09/2014, 18:27 - Shaggy: I'm by the arc, it's called brewhouse now

25/09/2014, 18:55 - Shaggy: We're getting food now so it's final

26/09/2014, 08:44 - Z cate fuchter: Thanks Marth! 3 days left. On the bus right now with eye of the tiger playing in my head ÓÅêÓÅê
26/09/2014, 08:44 - Tegan: Yeeeeeeah

26/09/2014, 09:01 - Martha: Montage scene. GO CATE!
26/09/2014, 09:32 - Owen: How much is the bonus? If it is more then 300 the rational choice would be to just buy yourself a monkey (or whatever percentage of a monkey is equal to 300).
26/09/2014, 10:04 - Z cate fuchter: Haha. The bonus is 10%. Or five monkies (?) Not sure where this cost of monkey estimate has come from Owen!
26/09/2014, 10:06 - Adimina: üôäÓàÅüôâÓÑïüôàÓîüüòÜ
26/09/2014, 11:03 - Owen: 10% of everything over the bonus limit? Or 10% of all your sales for the month?
26/09/2014, 12:11 - Adimina: So I just discovered that since 2011 LOL has been formally recognized in the Oxford dictionary
26/09/2014, 12:37 - Mike SJ: I like lol

28/09/2014, 16:54 - Sam Roberts: Addy's left us some homemade burgers if you fancy one
28/09/2014, 16:57 - Tegan: Sorry to miss this momentous occasion
28/09/2014, 16:57 - Tegan: Needs to be a Sunday of penitence though
28/09/2014, 16:57 - Sam Roberts: You were in our hearts
28/09/2014, 16:58 - Sam Roberts: What happened?
28/09/2014, 16:58 - Tegan: My parents were staying
28/09/2014, 16:59 - Tegan: Feel like if we can't get through a weekend of moderation with them then I'm pretty much genetically screwed
28/09/2014, 16:59 - Tegan: And I will always have to have sunday hangovers
29/09/2014, 08:33 - Sam Roberts: Sorry to do a Hannah guys but...
29/09/2014, 08:34 - Sam Roberts: <Media omitted>
29/09/2014, 08:43 - Tegan: That's tomorrow aswell! You double life leader you
29/09/2014, 08:59 - Sam Roberts: Hehe 'climbing'
29/09/2014, 08:59 - Sam Roberts: I'm really intrigued, might pop along and see what my id gets me into
29/09/2014, 09:31 - Shaggy: Lol!
29/09/2014, 09:54 - Alex Bunn: To youtube!
29/09/2014, 10:28 - Owen: Your like Ron Swanson sam.
29/09/2014, 10:28 - Owen: You're*
29/09/2014, 10:49 - Adimina: So it's almost October. Anyone keen to arrange a trip to Thorpe Park Fright Nights
29/09/2014, 10:51 - Krizia: Sam!!!! He loves the rollercoasters ;)
29/09/2014, 10:51 - Krizia: And me!! I haven't been in a park for ages!  I always faint though
29/09/2014, 11:03 - Sam Roberts: I've never been on a roller coaster, feels a little strange to make it to 28 and then pop my cherry
29/09/2014, 11:06 - Dave: It'll be even stranger of you make it to 29
29/09/2014, 11:06 - Dave: if
29/09/2014, 11:08 - Adimina: Haha true. Even numbers are best
29/09/2014, 12:28 - Alex Bunn: Ive never been on one of those massive ones either
29/09/2014, 12:29 - Shaggy: That's what she said
29/09/2014, 12:32 - Alex Bunn: <Media omitted>
29/09/2014, 12:36 - Owen: Sam. My pension counts as an untaxed allowance correct?
29/09/2014, 12:37 - Owen: So my taxable income is my income minus my pension.
29/09/2014, 12:37 - Owen: And minus NI?
29/09/2014, 12:40 - Owen: Wait. The ¬£10,000 limit before you start having to pay tax counts as an allowance.
29/09/2014, 12:41 - Owen: ?
29/09/2014, 12:41 - Owen: Be on lunch break already. I want answers!!
29/09/2014, 12:44 - Owen: Never mind. I figured it out.
29/09/2014, 12:45 - Owen: By the way. If you earn less than 41k then tax on dividends is only 10% compared to the 20% on regular savings. If you earn more than that then dividend tax is 32.5%
29/09/2014, 12:46 - Mike SJ: Banter
29/09/2014, 12:47 - Owen: Lel
29/09/2014, 12:47 - Owen: What I just said was wrong anyway.
29/09/2014, 12:47 - Owen: There is a 10% tax credit.
29/09/2014, 12:48 - Owen: So if you earn below 41k you pay no tax on dividends.
29/09/2014, 12:48 - Owen: And 22.5% if you earn more than 41k.
29/09/2014, 12:48 - Shaggy: Yawn
29/09/2014, 12:49 - Owen: Fine. Go invest your money somewhere stupid like up your arse!
29/09/2014, 12:50 - Shaggy: I invest my money into beer, and my fund, read stomach, has swollen enough to show that it's a good choice
29/09/2014, 12:51 - Tegan: Plus investment in liver cirrhosis at this stage negates the need to think about retirement plans
29/09/2014, 12:52 - Tegan: Morbid, yet simple
29/09/2014, 12:53 - Owen: Ok well I'm going to choose companies with a high price to earnings ratio and..... who am I kidding I'll invest in booze as well.
29/09/2014, 12:54 - Adimina: Woo boozevestment
29/09/2014, 12:57 - Sam Roberts: Great bant-ccountancy Owen, thanks
29/09/2014, 12:58 - Sam Roberts: And the 10% credit means you actually get money back for getting dividend income, it's to encourage poor people to invest in the market, which I find weird on a few levels
29/09/2014, 12:58 - Adimina: In other news. I just watched three episodes of parks and rec back to back
29/09/2014, 12:59 - Alex Bunn: Get a job
29/09/2014, 13:00 - Adimina: I have a job. It's called couch tuner
29/09/2014, 13:01 - Alex Bunn: Haha. Aw man i wish i was watching parks and rec!
29/09/2014, 13:03 - Adimina: You could be. If you quit. He he he
29/09/2014, 13:04 - Adimina: True fact: addiction to parks and rec us the heading cause of unemployment
29/09/2014, 13:05 - Tegan: Neither true, nor a fact. But 'true fact' is a truism.
29/09/2014, 13:05 - Tegan: So there's that
29/09/2014, 13:06 - Tegan: Man, I'm in a monday mood. Sigh.
29/09/2014, 13:06 - Alex Bunn: I just ate a lovely Gulash from EAT
29/09/2014, 13:07 - Alex Bunn: That helped
29/09/2014, 13:07 - Tegan: I decided to try itsu again. Bad decision.
29/09/2014, 13:07 - Tegan: That shit is nasty.
29/09/2014, 13:10 - Krizia: Hahahaha !   I'm in I won't work again mood, so I'll participate in any sort of conversa!!! it's been a very very slow day :$
29/09/2014, 13:16 - Lorna: I leave my job tomorrow. So anything I do badly today is someone else's problem. Comforting. And in no way motivating.
29/09/2014, 13:17 - Krizia: ÓåíÓåíÓåí congrats! !!
29/09/2014, 13:37 - Tegan: Party cones!
29/09/2014, 14:45 - Sam Roberts: I love itsu! The rare salmon steak is one of my all time favorite work lunches
29/09/2014, 15:14 - Tegan: They leave a lot to be desired in the world of noodle soups
29/09/2014, 15:15 - Tegan: Tomato soup isn't Japanese!
29/09/2014, 15:15 - Tegan: They have taken 'fusion' to a terrible place
29/09/2014, 15:23 - Hannah Murphy: Soup is poor but their sushi is the top
29/09/2014, 15:27 - Tegan: They also don't do any veg sushi really
29/09/2014, 15:27 - Tegan: Which makes wasabi my lunchtime fave
29/09/2014, 15:33 - Angela: Itsu used to have some really nice veggie potsu but they have got rid of them and replaced them with chicken and duck. I was mighty disappointed and now all their veggie food sucks
29/09/2014, 15:34 - Angela: Apart from "selected stores", lucky bastards.
29/09/2014, 15:35 - Angela: Best veggie sushi is crushh. Crussh?
29/09/2014, 15:35 - Angela: It all looks wrong!

30/09/2014, 16:03 - Angela: I don't even know how to express how that comment made me feel
30/09/2014, 16:03 - Angela: A cross between amusement and horror
30/09/2014, 16:04 - Angela: üôÄüòøüòπ
30/09/2014, 16:27 - Alex Bunn: Lol well noticed!

30/09/2014, 20:51 - Vanessa: They didn't have tickets
30/09/2014, 20:52 - Vanessa: They used their charm to get in
30/09/2014, 21:04 - Alex Bunn: Gay
30/09/2014, 21:22 - Sam Roberts: I changed the bouncer's perception of homoerotica
30/09/2014, 21:22 - Sam Roberts: Nohomo
30/09/2014, 21:23 - Bongo: Everything about that sentence was indeedhomo
30/09/2014, 21:23 - Bongo: That's like saying "I hate Jews"

30/09/2014, 23:09 - Sam Roberts: Free tickets for everyone
01/10/2014, 07:56 - Owen: Sounds like he changed your perception then.
01/10/2014, 20:07 - Vanessa: Is anybody interested in seeing the Nick Cave movie 20,000 days?
01/10/2014, 20:17 - Tegan: I'd be up for that

01/10/2014, 20:53 - Vanessa: I was thinking Sat during the day just because they predict it to be raining
01/10/2014, 20:53 - Vanessa: But I'm flexible
01/10/2014, 20:54 - Tegan: Could do....
01/10/2014, 20:54 - Tegan: I don't have plans
01/10/2014, 20:54 - Tegan: I don't think
01/10/2014, 20:55 - Vanessa: Most of the other showings are during the work day
01/10/2014, 20:55 - Krizia: Mmmm let me check!!! I have tickets to a thing I just need to know at what time it starts!

06/10/2014, 13:26 - Angela: The cat is slightly high maintenance - the one time we ever left her alone overnight she brought a revenge pigeon into the house (her only ever kill), so as long as you can be in the house at least at some point overnight she should be fine!
06/10/2014, 13:27 - Angela: I live in streatham btw if that's ok for you?
06/10/2014, 14:32 - Owen: Angela you could train your cat to go to the loo like the cat in meet the parents.

06/10/2014, 14:39 - Owen: Can you shoot her to get her to play dead yet?

14/10/2014, 11:01 - Krizia: It's a beaaauuuttiiful language
14/10/2014, 11:05 - Hannah Murphy: Go on international house
14/10/2014, 11:06 - Hannah Murphy: They do semi -intensive courses (twice a week) for only 25¬£ - if you do a special option where you're being taught by trainee teachers (rather than qualified ones)
14/10/2014, 11:09 - Dave: I saw that it was cheap - is the teaching good?
14/10/2014, 11:49 - Joe Jarman: What do you want, start from basics book style learning, conversation practice or wat?
14/10/2014, 11:50 - Joe Jarman: I've never had a spanish lesson üòê
14/10/2014, 11:56 - Dave: I'll need to start from the very beginning. I like the idea of some lessons to get the conversational side and it's nice to have a teacher.
14/10/2014, 11:56 - Dave: What did you do before going travelling?
14/10/2014, 11:57 - Sam Roberts: I'd be interested in joining if you find something Dave, I've always wondered what Kriz is saying
14/10/2014, 11:59 - Krizia: Hahahhaha!!! You don't want to know ;)
14/10/2014, 11:59 - Joe Jarman: I watched a lot of tv and had a spanish lady friend aaaand did an audio course a while ago. Went to Espa√±a a few times, did duolingo which is great but you can't beat conversation practice with local people
14/10/2014, 11:59 - Joe Jarman: Because that's your end goal right
14/10/2014, 12:00 - Joe Jarman: So check out italki and verbling web sites

14/10/2014, 12:02 - Joe Jarman: I think I'm shit now because of a lack of conversation practice but I still understand a lot
14/10/2014, 12:03 - Sam Roberts: I got on really well with duolingo, really fun way to learn some basics, I feel like a commitment now would help a lot though
14/10/2014, 12:05 - Owen: Just shout loads and say everything is beuuutiiifullll. Thats spanish isn't it?
14/10/2014, 12:18 - Joe Jarman: That's what krizea does definitely Óêâ

20/10/2014, 13:46 - Adimina: Hey kids, so erryone who wants to come Saturday the place is booked at 1:45 so I suggest meeting at Uxbridge station at 12:30 in full kigu if possible. We cab either get a public transport bus which takes Ca. 20-30 min, or I book a taxi for fifteen purple or so (Phil kinda knows wagwan just not specifics)... Also if you've no idea what I'm on about message me directly.
20/10/2014, 14:42 - Martha: You can probably take a bike on the train since its a weekend, so I'll probably do that, any other takers?

20/10/2014, 14:53 - Adimina: Hmmm yea bike actually would be cool

"Oh that's too bad," he says. "Where did you get stung?"
"Right between the first and second hole," she tells him.
"Hmmm," he says, "Sounds like your stance is too wide."

04/11/2014, 11:53 - Adimina: Anyone got a wee sleeping bag I can steal for Vietnam?
04/11/2014, 12:02 - Joe Jarman: Have you tried blacks
04/11/2014, 12:03 - Adimina: Who/ what is a black?
04/11/2014, 12:07 - Joe Jarman: It's a place for stealing sleeping bags
04/11/2014, 12:09 - Joe Jarman: Failing that, ben thanh market
04/11/2014, 12:09 - Adimina: Haha
04/11/2014, 12:56 - Owen: For a while i was trying to understand that as some racist joke. "Are black people often homeless or something?!"

Then i realised you meant the camping shop.
04/11/2014, 12:59 - Owen: Maybe they are avid campers. Thats not a sterotype I have heard though.
04/11/2014, 13:05 - Adimina: Racist Owen
04/11/2014, 13:08 - Joe Jarman: Black people hate camping, thus more.likely to give up sleeping bags?! Óêâ
04/11/2014, 16:57 - Mike SJ: TIL I've lived in the 3 most unaffordable cities in the country woooo!
04/11/2014, 16:57 - Mike SJ: Seriously, still gonna be renting when I'm 40 üò©

04/11/2014, 17:08 - Mike SJ: 4 MORE YEARS! 4 MORE YEARS!
04/11/2014, 19:01 - Lorna: Maybe you could afford a deposit and buy the house if you all club together...
04/11/2014, 19:04 - Owen: You clearly haven't seen how much money that house spends on beer lorna üòÉ
04/11/2014, 19:05 - Owen: They could probably get the deposit by saving up a week's worth of empties and selling the aluminum.
04/11/2014, 19:11 - Bongo: Yea but then the cleaner wouldn't have anything to pick up
04/11/2014, 19:26 - Sam Roberts: Can't believe she's lasted so long
04/11/2014, 19:26 - Sam Roberts: Even through bin-gate, and this Saturday's binge fest
04/11/2014, 19:28 - Mike SJ: Didn't the landlord get it for like 50k?
04/11/2014, 21:26 - Sam Roberts: ¬£50 and a bag full of nails
04/11/2014, 21:55 - Bongo: Lol bin-gate
04/11/2014, 21:57 - Bongo: Some witch was like "have this house on yonder but beware! mould grows everywhere, ye shall be plagued by rats and forever there will be the foulest stench enflicted upon man"
04/11/2014, 21:57 - Bongo: But lucky for him he found you guys
04/11/2014, 22:13 - Owen: I think the foul stench will clear itself right up when phil goes abroad for a bit.
04/11/2014, 22:21 - Sam Roberts: That's the only thing keeping the mould at bay
05/11/2014, 01:14 - Adimina: Ah but its really not

05/11/2014, 09:18 - Mike SJ: Can already tell this is going to be a slow day for me
05/11/2014, 09:35 - Adimina: If anyone is around kings cross and needs distracting from work hit me up. Alls I'm doing today is washing and buying a sleeping bag
05/11/2014, 12:57 - Owen: A conversation i just overheard between two kids: "do you think scorpion from mortal kombat could overcome the combined might of the chaos gods on battle?"... I teach such nerds!
05/11/2014, 12:57 - Owen: They are literally like comic book guy from the simpsons.
05/11/2014, 12:58 - Sam Roberts: .... well could he?

05/11/2014, 13:01 - Adimina: Look who's come to say hello
05/11/2014, 13:03 - Mike SJ: Scorpion ain't all that
05/11/2014, 13:33 - Phil: Shut your dirty mouth mike you sub human sub zero fanboy. Obviously scorpion can't battle all the chaos gods but he'd do better than pretty much anyone else.
05/11/2014, 14:07 - Mike SJ: People just like scorpion cause of the stupid sob story. He's like those contestants on X factor who are on there cause their dad died even though everyone knows they won't win
05/11/2014, 14:14 - Alex Bunn: üëèüëè
05/11/2014, 14:29 - Phil: The sob story came later when the drooling masses couldn't handle that a bad ass ninja had no back story beyond being a bad ass ninja.
05/11/2014, 14:48 - Shaggy: Yellow is a pretty awesome colour
05/11/2014, 14:50 - Owen: Scorpion is a pretty awesome animal.
05/11/2014, 15:26 - Dave: Skulls are cool
05/11/2014, 15:43 - Shaggy: And so is fire
05/11/2014, 16:00 - Phil: Also, harpoons.
05/11/2014, 16:13 - Mike SJ: These are dumb arguments
05/11/2014, 16:16 - Mike SJ: He's a cheap-ass teleporting bitch
05/11/2014, 16:19 - Phil: Someone got his ass beat by scorpion to many times. He was just the vessel man.

11/11/2014, 09:42 - Shaggy: Why is a woman in hijab in the picture? Could you not afford real costumes and just wore burkas?
11/11/2014, 09:42 - Dave: Can you imagine?
11/11/2014, 10:48 - Sam Roberts: Thought it was a super racist headline in first glance, I'm much happier at the thought of ninja terrorist Mike
11/11/2014, 12:46 - Phil: I think that is the closest anyone can reasonably come to being called a teenage mutant ninja turtle by a newspaper. Congrats mike.

11/11/2014, 19:51 - Lorna: I'm super close
11/11/2014, 20:12 - Shaggy: We're in the barbican centre, need to go to level -2
12/11/2014, 10:32 - Alex Bunn: I think interstellar is worth a second watch
12/11/2014, 10:33 - Alex Bunn: With lowered expectations
12/11/2014, 10:33 - Alex Bunn: There was a lot to be appreciated in that film
12/11/2014, 10:33 - Alex Bunn: But there was also a lot that was lame
12/11/2014, 10:34 - Owen: Phil needs to see it again definitely. Because he spent half the film in the loo
12/11/2014, 10:34 - Alex Bunn: Shit. Probably not worth a convo here cos theres peeps that havnt seen it
12/11/2014, 10:34 - Henry Dranks: I absolutely loved it. beautiful homage to some of my fav scifi
12/11/2014, 10:34 - Sam Roberts: It's weird, I really enjoyed maybe 9/10 of it, but felt cheated by the end
12/11/2014, 10:34 - Owen: The last 15 minutes just shouldn't have been in the film
12/11/2014, 10:35 - Tegan: Lots of Sci Fi films s have that quality though
12/11/2014, 10:36 - Mike SJ: Yeah like Source Code
12/11/2014, 10:37 - Mike SJ: Interstellar was pretty daft, can't say I wasn't entertained though
12/11/2014, 10:37 - Mike SJ: Low marks for the Barbican cinema though
12/11/2014, 10:37 - Shaggy: I think Matthew mcconaghey had a speech impediment, did he have a stroke?
12/11/2014, 10:37 - Mike SJ: I think its more that the sound was shit
12/11/2014, 10:38 - Owen: Yeah barbican cinema was rubbish
12/11/2014, 10:38 - Owen: Barbican't  more like! Amiright?!
12/11/2014, 10:38 - Alex Bunn: Yeah i think we might have had a better experience somewhere else
12/11/2014, 10:38 - Alex Bunn: My fave was the sarcastic robot
12/11/2014, 10:38 - Shaggy: IMAX
12/11/2014, 10:49 - Martha: Meh, I agree the screen was pretty weeny, but it was nice to go somewhere close to me for once. Thank you folks for coming to my neck of the woods! That wins you 3 times I don't complain about going east :)
12/11/2014, 10:49 - Martha: Sarcastic robot wins it.
12/11/2014, 10:50 - Owen: Marthican't more like! Amiright folks!?
12/11/2014, 10:50 - Owen: üêõ
12/11/2014, 10:51 - Sam Roberts: Could've done with subtitles
12/11/2014, 10:51 - Martha: I just realised: you know that film 'contact' I said it was quite like? Matthew mcconnorghdkdkd was in that too.
12/11/2014, 10:52 - Sam Roberts: I liked the barbican centre though, felt like we were running through a Kafka novel to get there
12/11/2014, 10:52 - Martha: Yes to subtitles, then we might have been able to understand over bun's rustling.
12/11/2014, 10:54 - Sam Roberts: Hahaha I'd forgotten that! Full points for rustling bunny!
12/11/2014, 11:30 - Alex Bunn: Shouldve munched during re-entry
12/11/2014, 11:31 - Mike SJ: Or during one of those organ solos
12/11/2014, 11:33 - Joe Jarman: Anyone left who hasn't seen it?
12/11/2014, 11:33 - Joe Jarman: I want to go today üòÑ
12/11/2014, 12:04 - Phil: I went for one perfectly timed piss. I missed a few minutes of crying and "daddy please don't go".
12/11/2014, 18:40 - Owen: I am here!
12/11/2014, 18:40 - Owen: Which flat are you?
12/11/2014, 18:42 - Martha: D, but call xav, I don't think he's there yet. I'm not
12/11/2014, 18:42 - Martha: (Sorry)
12/11/2014, 18:42 - Owen: Goddamn it.
12/11/2014, 18:43 - Owen: Ok I'll  sit on the stairs and wait for one of you
12/11/2014, 18:43 - Martha: Meh, he organised. I work late.
12/11/2014, 18:43 - Owen: I think you mean he disorganised
13/11/2014, 07:29 - Mike SJ: <Media omitted>
13/11/2014, 07:35 - Shaggy: <Media omitted>
13/11/2014, 07:43 - Sam Roberts: <Media omitted>
13/11/2014, 08:03 - Vinay: Happy birthday Hannah!
13/11/2014, 08:03 - Vinay: I just realized Hannah is a palindrome...
13/11/2014, 08:09 - Owen: Wow. Isn't it ironic than palindnilap is also a palindnilap.
13/11/2014, 08:21 - Hannah Murphy: There are 2 types of people in the world. Those who can extrapolate from incomplete data.
13/11/2014, 08:33 - Owen: And mutant lizard men?
13/11/2014, 08:43 - Mike SJ: A Toyota Hannah! A Toyota!
13/11/2014, 08:46 - Krizia: Happy happy bday Hannah!!! Hope you have a blast!!!

13/11/2014, 13:10 - Tegan: All amazing
13/11/2014, 13:10 - Tegan: Though I like 26 a lot
13/11/2014, 13:29 - Tegan: Why not test your memory with the 'Richard Madeley or Alan Partridge' quiz?
13/11/2014, 13:29 - Tegan: http://i100.independent.co.uk/article/who-said-it-richard-madeley-or-alan-partridge--ekEJrmQ5Pg
13/11/2014, 14:23 - Bongo: Is anyone else reading those quotes in an alan partridge voice?
14/11/2014, 11:08 - Hannah Murphy: Is it your last day at ocado mike?
14/11/2014, 11:08 - Hannah Murphy: What havoc are you going to wreak? Woooo! Celebrations
14/11/2014, 11:10 - Lorna: Delete all the data
14/11/2014, 11:11 - Joe Jarman: Forward all orders to tesco
14/11/2014, 11:11 - Tegan: That would be impish
14/11/2014, 11:13 - Owen: Damn that was a horde analysis anyway. My üê≤s were worthless there
14/11/2014, 11:14 - Owen: I would like back onto nergasm though mike... i promise not to üê≤ anymore
14/11/2014, 11:14 - Mike SJ: <Media omitted>
14/11/2014, 11:14 - Tegan: I think Mike also counts each consecutive Newgate from one person as one message
14/11/2014, 11:15 - Tegan: So you need to be more strategic
14/11/2014, 11:15 - Tegan: Nice
14/11/2014, 11:17 - Hannah Murphy: Impish!
14/11/2014, 11:18 - Hannah Murphy: Great word teegZ
14/11/2014, 11:18 - Owen: So i just need to insert a üê≤
14/11/2014, 11:19 - Owen: Every time someone else says something?
14/11/2014, 11:19 - Tegan: I bequeath it to you as your birthday word
14/11/2014, 11:19 - Tegan: Use it well
14/11/2014, 11:20 - Owen: Me? üê≤
14/11/2014, 11:22 - Alex Bunn: Ocado must be fucked. Som many people in Mikes team have handed in their notice since he dis
14/11/2014, 11:23 - Owen: Dis....
14/11/2014, 11:23 - Owen: Dont leave us hanging.
14/11/2014, 11:24 - Owen: OP will deliver....?
14/11/2014, 11:33 - Sam Roberts: *did. I wonder if text typos are improving humanity's lateral thinking. It's like every fifth message is a little logic puzzle
14/11/2014, 11:35 - Owen: I was thinking 'disappeared'
14/11/2014, 11:42 - Dan Sluckin: ...membered 12 people in that incident.
14/11/2014, 11:45 - Owen: He didn't quit, he was committed to a mental asylum after all that dismembering.
14/11/2014, 11:47 - Mike SJ: Yeah 5 out of 9 people from my team handed in their notice in the last month
14/11/2014, 11:48 - Mike SJ: <Media omitted>
14/11/2014, 11:48 - Mike SJ: On the other hand, the Ocado share price rallied like the day after I resigned
14/11/2014, 11:48 - Mike SJ: Lol
14/11/2014, 11:53 - Sam Roberts: 'stock prices rose dramatically on the news that Mike Jones, the infamous data analyst, was leaving the company'
14/11/2014, 11:55 - Owen: "Shareholders held a massive party with thier increased dividends. There were rumours of a 'mike effigy' being burned and beaten."
14/11/2014, 11:58 - Owen: "Mike jones is now being employed as simultaneous head of both barcleys and RBS"
14/11/2014, 12:07 - Tegan: Lol
14/11/2014, 12:11 - Mike SJ: <Media omitted>
14/11/2014, 12:17 - Joe Jarman: That's some damn fine data science
14/11/2014, 12:18 - Joe Jarman: Shaggy needs to be careful because someone likes.McDonald's too much
14/11/2014, 12:18 - Tegan: Exemplary. Did you see mike's last horde analysis?
14/11/2014, 12:18 - Owen: Sam better be careful because someone likes italians too much.
14/11/2014, 12:19 - Tegan: (The idea that that is shaggy's problem is more than gently misogynistic)
14/11/2014, 12:20 - Owen: Dave! Get your woman back in line. She is talking out of turn!
14/11/2014, 12:22 - Tegan: Looking for an emoji to express my feminist vitriol...
14/11/2014, 12:22 - Krizia: Hahaha
14/11/2014, 12:22 - Tegan: üíÖ?
14/11/2014, 12:23 - Hannah Murphy: Use the macsonalds one
14/11/2014, 12:23 - Tegan: Right on sister
14/11/2014, 12:23 - Owen: üë∞

26/11/2014, 17:04 - Krizia: Easyyyy ‚ò∫ I'm very excited the only issue I see is containing myself!! I might be a bit loud and hyperactive ;)

05/12/2014, 14:12 - Sam Roberts: Looks like nothing changed!
05/12/2014, 14:14 - Martha: Not much to be honest! It looks a bit richer here and there (fancy tv screens, scary automatic video capture in all of the lecture rooms) but it's still a nostalgia bonanza.
05/12/2014, 14:22 - Tegan: Nice
05/12/2014, 15:55 - Dave: How did your talk go?
05/12/2014, 16:00 - Martha: Went well, thanks!!

07/12/2014, 02:47 - Alex Bunn: It was way coool
07/12/2014, 02:48 - Alex Bunn: I caught my front wheel in a drain while i did a super cool undertaking manouvre
07/12/2014, 02:48 - Alex Bunn: And then i had to get the super cool nightbus home
07/12/2014, 12:02 - Sam Roberts: You tried to have the thrill ride off your life, but ended up on the night bus to Croydon?

08/12/2014, 19:27 - Vinay: Lol
08/12/2014, 19:28 - Vinay: I'm up for skating on Wednesday... Hopefully it won't be raining
09/12/2014, 13:36 - Dave: Would anyone like to take my place kayaking from Limehouse to the Victoria park winter wonderland thing? It clashes with my work Xmas meal. Happy to offer the ticket at a good discount. X
09/12/2014, 13:46 - Shaggy: Lol you have to pay money to do it?!
09/12/2014, 14:18 - Joe Jarman: Yeah it sounds pretty brutal kayaking in this weather
09/12/2014, 14:19 - Tegan: We didn't remember what cold was like when we signed up
09/12/2014, 14:19 - Tegan: I'm probably going to end up in tears
09/12/2014, 14:20 - Tegan: Good group though- Petia etc
09/12/2014, 14:21 - Phil: Is petia a group or a person?
09/12/2014, 14:22 - Joe Jarman: I like those guys
09/12/2014, 14:22 - Joe Jarman: Petias not a big joe jarman fan
09/12/2014, 14:22 - Joe Jarman: I think I consumed something naughty off her macbook
09/12/2014, 14:22 - Tegan: Bygones?
09/12/2014, 14:23 - Joe Jarman: Yeah I think shes kool
09/12/2014, 14:23 - Tegan: You should come to winter wonderland for the aftermath
09/12/2014, 14:23 - Joe Jarman: But I have my work party tomorrow
09/12/2014, 14:23 - Tegan: Il have stopped crying by then
09/12/2014, 14:23 - Tegan: Ah well
09/12/2014, 14:45 - Sam Roberts: Who's organising? Well there be wet suits?
09/12/2014, 14:46 - Tegan: BYO :(
09/12/2014, 14:47 - Sam Roberts: Winter wonderland would be an excellent meet up and skate place
09/12/2014, 14:47 - +44 7944 609055 left
09/12/2014, 14:52 - Shaggy: I would cut your losses right now and bail, like em just now
09/12/2014, 14:57 - Sam Roberts: That'd be awesome with a proper suit+ gloves
09/12/2014, 15:08 - Tegan: Nah,  I'm gon' do it.  Join us after for mulled wine? Is there an ice rink at the Victoria Park winterthingaling?
09/12/2014, 15:08 - Sam Roberts: I'll give you 40% survival without

09/12/2014, 19:33 - Sam Roberts: Gimme a wetsuit and I'm there!
09/12/2014, 19:33 - Sam Roberts: How much are the tickets?
09/12/2014, 19:34 - Phil: Surely you can't kayak in this weather without a wetsuit. This is a country where they barely trust people near ankle deep water without a 2m railing and some barbed wire
09/12/2014, 19:36 - Dave: I'm loathed to say how much the tickets were but for you, ¬£15.
09/12/2014, 19:41 - Tegan: Brown wooded butttocks

09/12/2014, 19:48 - Tegan: Also come kayaking
09/12/2014, 19:49 - Sam Roberts: That all worked out nicely! Need anything from the shop Phil?
09/12/2014, 19:50 - Phil: Depends if you want stir fry. If yes, read house bants.
09/12/2014, 20:21 - Tegan: Hope I didn't put you out of your way with my Wolf boy beer cry
09/12/2014, 20:24 - Sam Roberts: Made me leave the office as it happens, I'm cook with that woolfie

10/12/2014, 12:08 - Joe Jarman: Kickass.so
10/12/2014, 12:12 - Sam Roberts: Victoria park for winter wonderland + seeing if Teeg survives
10/12/2014, 12:13 - Sam Roberts: The guys can skate and the ladies can drink mulled wine and watch
10/12/2014, 13:29 - Mike SJ: Apparently we're going to WW after the office Xmas party on Friday
10/12/2014, 13:30 - Mike SJ: What could go wrong
10/12/2014, 13:31 - Shaggy: What's that?
10/12/2014, 13:31 - Shaggy: Wild Weekend?
10/12/2014, 13:32 - Sam Roberts: With wanton women
10/12/2014, 13:33 - Shaggy: Wow
10/12/2014, 13:34 - Mike SJ: Wicky wicky wild wild wenches
10/12/2014, 13:54 - Dave: Looks like I'm gonna be kayaking too. The more warm hugs the better at vikkie park
10/12/2014, 16:38 - Sam Roberts: Sooo I've got a heap still to do, looks like I might be stuck here for the night :(

10/12/2014, 18:10 - Alex Bunn: No-one is making plans by the look of things
10/12/2014, 18:10 - Alex Bunn: Pub in London Bridge?
10/12/2014, 18:11 - Sam Roberts: No word from teeg and Dave, I think they've succumbed to hypothermia already
10/12/2014, 18:12 - Sam Roberts: I'm going to be stuck here couple of hours at least, might come join if you're out though
10/12/2014, 18:13 - Alex Bunn: Thats what i was hoping for. Need to organise something due to my lack of phone network and dependency on wifi
10/12/2014, 18:13 - Alex Bunn: Phil if we decide will you come?
10/12/2014, 18:24 - Alex Bunn: Ok i'm going home

10/12/2014, 22:31 - Lorna: How was the winterville thing?
10/12/2014, 22:32 - Tegan: It was closed when we arrived
10/12/2014, 22:32 - Tegan: So mu
11/12/2014, 13:13 - Mike SJ: Datum just went to chipotle for the first time
11/12/2014, 13:14 - Mike SJ: Felt like being in one of those crazy fast F1 pit stops
11/12/2014, 13:14 - Mike SJ: *Dayum
11/12/2014, 13:48 - Shaggy: They swapped your tires?
11/12/2014, 13:49 - Joe Jarman: Gave him some fuel definitely

11/12/2014, 16:13 - Mike SJ: Favourite business terms at qubit seem to be 'deep-dive (into)' and 'verticals'

11/12/2014, 17:56 - Bongo: Where is the FTP?
11/12/2014, 18:05 - Sam Roberts: I love that one... we had to set up a sftp (probably) connection with npower, only no one really knew the right combination of letters
11/12/2014, 18:06 - Sam Roberts: 'is the ssfftpps server ready?' (Power glare to see if they'll call your bluff)

23/12/2014, 18:20 - Mike SJ: @Lorna no it's got to be aged in a cave, or a grotto at the very least
23/12/2014, 19:07 - Dan Sluckin: Nook or cranny aged cheese just doesn't cut it for me any more.

28/12/2014, 23:10 - Mike SJ: Well, I for one am shocked, saddened, and quite drunk by the lack of uproar at this loss.  People leave this group all the time. Usually if I have any reaction at all, it's a positive one. Good riddance says I, for a herd of buffulo can only move as fast as its slowest, and least comical member.  But tonight, we have lost a true The Horde titan. He never contributed a lot, but everything he did was hilariously accurate, terse, and withering in execution. He will be sorely missed.

19/01/2015, 21:01 - Owen: Or maybe it was shaggy causing all the mess all along.
19/01/2015, 21:03 - Mike SJ: Man you should see the projector room
19/01/2015, 21:04 - Mike SJ: There's like 2 cubic metres less crap in there now

19/01/2015, 21:10 - Owen: Must be a half austrian half ukranian with a machete and the ability to brew.
19/01/2015, 21:10 - Owen: Im sure you can find that.

22/01/2015, 13:59 - Bongo: When the fuck did jingoistic braggadocio become a widely used term?!
22/01/2015, 14:00 - Bongo: It's sounds like a spell
22/01/2015, 14:12 - Lorna: Sounds like a will self quote
22/01/2015, 14:14 - Sam Roberts: Pretty sure it isn't dude...
22/01/2015, 14:14 - Sam Roberts: You having that thing where you hear a word for the first time, then it's everywhere all of a sudden?
22/01/2015, 14:14 - Sam Roberts: I'm sure there'a a conspiracy around that
22/01/2015, 14:22 - Angela: There's a theory that says when you learn another language, you hear a word regularly without taking it in it for ages, and then one day when your ability gets good enough you suddenly 'notice' it and either understand it through context or you look it up or whatever. Then after that, you notice it every time it's said because you know it's there. Which is spooky if it's also true in English, cos it means you're just deaf to this word for years but it's actually been there all along.......
22/01/2015, 14:23 - Alex Bunn: Good fact!
22/01/2015, 14:23 - Sam Roberts: Oh god, have you all being talking about jingoistic braggadocio all this time!? I've been dead to it until now!

24/01/2015, 17:22 - Vanessa: How come I've never heard about this uncle
24/01/2015, 17:23 - Alex Bunn: Well unfortunately he's not with us anymore üòì
24/01/2015, 17:25 - Shaggy: Heaven is halfpipe
24/01/2015, 17:29 - Joe Jarman: Hey shagz gonna restart your thing
24/01/2015, 17:30 - Joe Jarman: Thin it's almost done
24/01/2015, 17:45 - Shaggy: I thought it was done
24/01/2015, 18:28 - Sam Roberts: Home brew!
24/01/2015, 18:28 - Sam Roberts: Hey, don't put it on yet

24/01/2015, 18:29 - Alex Bunn: Hows the micro breweries?
24/01/2015, 18:29 - Alex Bunn: (Shags and V)
24/01/2015, 18:37 - Shaggy: Exquisite flavour of hops makes you really question the totalitarian rule of major corporate beer companies enthral lung their rule of blandness on out temporary existence
24/01/2015, 18:43 - Alex Bunn: And who says beer kills brain cells
24/01/2015, 20:01 - Tegan: Bastards
24/01/2015, 20:02 - Vinay: Jon snow
24/01/2015, 20:12 - Lorna: Too late Sam- beer's a brewin'. But we're gonna bottle it so it'll keep for a brew off.
24/01/2015, 23:34 - Sam Roberts: It's ON!
24/01/2015, 23:34 - Sam Roberts: I'm going to find out how to brew for high percentage, make some home brew special brew
25/01/2015, 01:01 - Lorna: If you brew with 1/10th of the water, then it'll make beer 10 times as strong right?...
25/01/2015, 01:09 - Sam Roberts: Sounds legit
25/01/2015, 01:09 - Sam Roberts: Or with 10x the sugar
25/01/2015, 01:10 - Sam Roberts: I hear the alcohol is just a calculation on the sugar
25/01/2015, 05:47 - Shaggy: Really? Sweet
25/01/2015, 09:15 - Owen: Alcohol content is sugar and yeast strain. Beer yeast will die at a lower abv than wine yeast.
25/01/2015, 10:09 - Lorna: So... Add wine yeast instead! This syrupy, sweet wine special brew will definitely give you the shits. üí©
25/01/2015, 12:21 - Dave: Mix in a load of vodka too.
25/01/2015, 12:21 - Dave: (Pro tip)

25/01/2015, 15:45 - Sam Roberts: I shall call it Tombstone
25/01/2015, 15:46 - Shaggy: You can freeze it and separate alcohol, there's one you can get in brewdog that's 52%
25/01/2015, 15:48 - Mike SJ: I think at some point you can't call it beer anymore haha
25/01/2015, 15:48 - Mike SJ: Sorites pissed paradox
27/01/2015, 07:31 - Tegan: Whiplash tonight at the wharf?
27/01/2015, 07:42 - Lorna: Yes to whiplash. Can I suggest a more central cinema?
27/01/2015, 07:46 - Tegan: We'll probably wharf as Dave has to work late

27/01/2015, 18:23 - Alex Bunn: Lol that bus stop kid is a born winner!
27/01/2015, 18:41 - Vanessa: I was told that in Germany you have to ask permission on the name you want to give your child
27/01/2015, 18:41 - Tegan: Mike, are you still up for the wharf?
27/01/2015, 18:47 - Mike SJ: Sure

27/01/2015, 21:05 - Mike SJ: <Media omitted>
27/01/2015, 23:03 - Mike SJ: So if I was running the Oscars, whiplash would be winning atm
27/01/2015, 23:03 - Mike SJ: Fucking hell
27/01/2015, 23:26 - Owen: Good then.
27/01/2015, 23:26 - Owen: ?

27/01/2015, 23:41 - Tegan: Hype hype hype!

27/01/2015, 23:43 - Dave: Was pretty great. Visceral, exhausting cinema. In a good way.
28/01/2015, 06:42 - Angela: Why did it make you angry teegs?
28/01/2015, 07:41 - Tegan: Either because it celebrated a sad cycle of dependency, or because I'll never be that good at anything
28/01/2015, 07:41 - Tegan: Probably the latter
28/01/2015, 07:48 - Angela: Getting old to the point where that becomes apparent is rubbish! No longer do I have potential üò¢
28/01/2015, 07:49 - Angela: I had so much potential!
28/01/2015, 07:51 - Sam Roberts: I've switched from aiming at rock climbing legend to sexy pensioner
28/01/2015, 07:56 - Mike SJ: I don't agree that it celebrated it Teegs, it was pretty neutral
28/01/2015, 08:05 - Alex Bunn: Lol Sam
28/01/2015, 08:06 - Owen: I'll just aim for pensioner
28/01/2015, 08:18 - Tegan: That's why I did probably the later
28/01/2015, 08:18 - Tegan: Latter
28/01/2015, 08:19 - Tegan: I expect

29/01/2015, 17:30 - Bongo: Sweet I'm in
29/01/2015, 17:31 - Bongo: Like beef shin
29/01/2015, 17:31 - Bongo: <Media omitted>
29/01/2015, 17:31 - Bongo: Rubbed in garlic, parsley salt and balsal, left to cook for 8 hours
29/01/2015, 17:32 - Owen: Stab holes in it and push the garlic into the holes. It caramalises and infuses the meat when it cooks.
29/01/2015, 17:33 - Joe Jarman: See you at dlr?
29/01/2015, 17:33 - Owen: Trust me. Its a may zing!

29/01/2015, 17:37 - Joe Jarman: Canne c u jimmee
29/01/2015, 17:47 - Owen: Yeah garlic caramalises. If you deprive it of oxygen.
29/01/2015, 17:48 - Owen: Try wrapping a bulb of garlic in foil and sticking it in the oven at 180 for an hour. It comes out sticky and sweet but still as garlicy.
29/01/2015, 17:49 - Shaggy: Sweet
29/01/2015, 17:51 - Tegan: Mmmmmm

29/01/2015, 20:58 - Mike SJ: Where there's a will there's a wat5
29/01/2015, 21:13 - Tegan: WAT5 MOTHERLICKERS
29/01/2015, 21:14 - Tegan: It's snowing
29/01/2015, 21:16 - Vinay: Where? Its dry as a baboons backside here
29/01/2015, 21:16 - Tegan: Kx
29/01/2015, 21:16 - Vinay: I got all excited
29/01/2015, 21:16 - Owen: Damn you teegs you made me look out the window.
29/01/2015, 21:16 - Owen: I was disappointed
29/01/2015, 21:17 - Vinay: Same
29/01/2015, 21:17 - Tegan: It won't settle
29/01/2015, 21:17 - Tegan: It's mainly damp
29/01/2015, 21:17 - Owen: Watch "Hercules - DISAPPOINTED" on YouTube - Hercules - DISAPPOINTED: http://youtu.be/_O1hM-k3aUY
29/01/2015, 21:17 - Tegan: Definite snowfall here though
30/01/2015, 09:32 - Martha: What plans for tonight? I'm in need of a chilled one - I'm thinking good food and films/episodes and a comfy couch. Shabong? Canning t? What say you?
30/01/2015, 09:35 - Shaggy: Team bonding exercise with work, meaning team bonds with alcohol, somewhere near work
30/01/2015, 09:35 - Owen: Whatever you do don't be hungover tomorrow Marth
30/01/2015, 09:36 - Alex Bunn: I'm going to a medieval banquet in st katherines docks
30/01/2015, 09:36 - Alex Bunn: Its gonna be ossum
30/01/2015, 09:41 - Tegan: I'm up for an episode of something Marth
30/01/2015, 09:41 - Tegan: I'm in c town
30/01/2015, 09:54 - Mike SJ: Someone told me a good comedy film called Chef came out last year, anyone up for that?
30/01/2015, 11:00 - Martha: Sure, awesome! Teegs - are you heading to Sutton on Saturday morning too? It will make the epic trek from canning t infinitely more enjoyable.
30/01/2015, 11:07 - Dave: I'd like to see chef - it's downloaded already
30/01/2015, 11:15 - Owen: 1 hour an epic trek does not make.
30/01/2015, 11:33 - Martha: Indeed, but 1h27 is getting there.
30/01/2015, 11:33 - Martha: <Media omitted>
30/01/2015, 11:34 - Sam Roberts: Uber
30/01/2015, 11:41 - Tegan: I think I'll have to wend my way home tonight as my laundry situation is pretty dire
30/01/2015, 11:41 - Tegan: But we can meet at lb or wherever the train goes from
30/01/2015, 11:52 - Owen: Thats a stupid way to go.
30/01/2015, 11:52 - Owen: Jubilee to Canada water. Overground to west croydon. Mainline to sutton.
30/01/2015, 11:53 - Owen: That is the best way. Takes about 1hour if you get the right train.
30/01/2015, 12:53 - Martha: Aw rats, I thought you and Dave were coming. Owen is there a critical number of people below which we might be forced to drink, eat cake and play Catan?
30/01/2015, 12:54 - Owen: Teegs is coming. Dave is not
30/01/2015, 12:55 - Owen: At the moment the list is: marth, teegs, steve, alice, lara, jim, eliza.
30/01/2015, 12:55 - Owen: So quite a few
30/01/2015, 13:41 - Lorna: By the way guys, chef is awesome! Comedy that gives you a warm gooey heartwarming feel. With shit loads of food porn. Eat before or line up and epic meat/cheese snack for afters.
30/01/2015, 14:07 - Alex Bunn: <Media omitted>
30/01/2015, 18:35 - Mike SJ: OK, so what do you think is the biggest animal by mass that you could have in a fight?
30/01/2015, 18:36 - Mike SJ: It is trying to kill you
30/01/2015, 18:36 - Mike SJ: No weapons, MMA octagon stylee
30/01/2015, 18:36 - Tegan: Could definitely take a cat
30/01/2015, 18:36 - Tegan: Or cat sized dog
30/01/2015, 18:36 - Owen: Blue whale.
30/01/2015, 18:37 - Mike SJ: Land animal
30/01/2015, 18:37 - Tegan: Probably not a Badger
30/01/2015, 18:37 - Owen: It's own weight would kill it in an mma octagon
30/01/2015, 18:39 - Lorna: Could definitely take a giant tortoise. Though its unlikely to ever try and kill me.
30/01/2015, 18:39 - Martha: Sloth
30/01/2015, 18:39 - Tegan: Good thinking lorna
30/01/2015, 18:39 - Tegan: Heavy but slow animals
30/01/2015, 18:40 - Owen: Maybe a crocodile. They can't open thier jaws if you apply a little force to them. I am not sure how I would kill it though. Maybe finger through the eye to the brain.
30/01/2015, 18:40 - Mike SJ: You could not even hope to hurt a tortoise though
30/01/2015, 18:41 - Owen: Kick it in the balls!
30/01/2015, 18:41 - Owen: No animal can cope with that.
30/01/2015, 18:41 - Mike SJ: Unless you flip it over and they're well heavy
30/01/2015, 18:42 - Mike SJ: I feel I could take a giraffe somehow
30/01/2015, 18:42 - Mike SJ: Would need a good strategy
30/01/2015, 18:42 - Owen: No way!
30/01/2015, 18:42 - Martha: I feel that you would find you cant
30/01/2015, 18:42 - Owen: Have you seen those fuckers fight?
30/01/2015, 18:43 - Owen: They neck whip each other.
30/01/2015, 18:43 - Owen: Giraffes are BAD ASS!
30/01/2015, 18:43 - Mike SJ: You got to trip it over somehow
30/01/2015, 18:43 - Shaggy: <Media omitted>
30/01/2015, 18:44 - Lorna: I'd flip that tortoise and elbow drop it. WWF style
30/01/2015, 18:46 - Tegan: Dang
30/01/2015, 18:47 - Lorna: Or a panda. Anyone could take a panda
30/01/2015, 18:49 - Mike SJ: Again, I think it would be tough to harm a panda
30/01/2015, 18:50 - Tegan: Are you allowed a rope?
30/01/2015, 18:50 - Alex Bunn: Yeah pandas suck
30/01/2015, 18:50 - Mike SJ: You'd have to hurt its feelings somehow
30/01/2015, 18:50 - Mike SJ: No ropes
30/01/2015, 18:50 - Mike SJ: I reckon a cow is doable
30/01/2015, 18:51 - Owen: A cow is basically a bull without horns though
30/01/2015, 18:51 - Tegan: Cows ares pretty solid
30/01/2015, 18:52 - Tegan: I reckon you could kick a sheep to death
30/01/2015, 18:52 - Owen: I don't really know how to kill any animal
30/01/2015, 18:52 - Owen: Except a chicken.
30/01/2015, 18:52 - Mike SJ: Giraffe you can strangle I reckon
30/01/2015, 18:52 - Martha: Guys this is pretty dark.
30/01/2015, 18:52 - Martha: Who started this?
30/01/2015, 18:52 - Mike SJ: Dave
30/01/2015, 18:53 - Martha: Mmm really?
30/01/2015, 18:53 - Mike SJ: Actually I'm continuing a convo from lunch
30/01/2015, 18:53 - Martha: My bets are on you for some reason
30/01/2015, 18:53 - Owen: I think you underestimate how big a giraffe's neck is.
30/01/2015, 18:53 - Mike SJ: It was much darker than this...
30/01/2015, 18:57 - Tegan: Mike, are you heading back to watch chef tonight?
30/01/2015, 18:57 - Bongo: A massive capybara
30/01/2015, 18:58 - Bongo: <Media omitted>
30/01/2015, 18:58 - Bongo: They're pretty much punching bags
30/01/2015, 18:59 - Bongo: They weigh a tonne and I bet they're so chilled they'd just let you punch them until they die
30/01/2015, 19:04 - Mike SJ: Yeah I'm at pub, leaving in 10
30/01/2015, 19:05 - Tegan: Aiight
30/01/2015, 19:37 - Dave: I could take an ostrich
30/01/2015, 19:38 - Martha: There in 30 xxx
30/01/2015, 19:38 - Dave: Whoop
30/01/2015, 19:38 - Mike SJ: Roman numeral bants
30/01/2015, 19:40 - Tegan: Niiice
30/01/2015, 19:47 - Bongo: I'm bored and ill, anyone want to come entertain me?
30/01/2015, 19:47 - Bongo: Probably one of the least tempting offers I've ever made but that just shows how extremely ill I am
30/01/2015, 20:15 - Tegan: Sorry dude - I'm being bored and ill over here
30/01/2015, 20:16 - Tegan: I would recommend the David Attenborough on the beeb about birds of paradise
30/01/2015, 20:16 - Tegan: The voice is medicine, and the birds are silly
30/01/2015, 20:29 - Tegan: Mike
30/01/2015, 20:29 - Tegan: Bring more wine
30/01/2015, 20:29 - Tegan: And Yorkshire puddings
30/01/2015, 20:30 - Tegan: Loads of Yorkshire puddings
30/01/2015, 20:30 - Dave: Plz
30/01/2015, 20:39 - Mike SJ: Yorkshire puddings?
30/01/2015, 20:39 - Mike SJ: Also Dave, are you nuts, an ostrich would kick your face off
30/01/2015, 20:40 - Dave: Yup x many
30/01/2015, 20:40 - Dave: Nah mate, I'd dodge it's kick and punch it in the beak
30/01/2015, 20:40 - Dave: BAM!
30/01/2015, 20:40 - Joe Jarman: Bongo
30/01/2015, 20:40 - Joe Jarman: Come here
30/01/2015, 20:40 - Joe Jarman: And we will look after you
30/01/2015, 20:40 - Joe Jarman: Ill send an uber
30/01/2015, 20:41 - Joe Jarman: Got some free credits
30/01/2015, 20:41 - Dave: Or maybe wrestle it
30/01/2015, 20:41 - Owen: Dave you can't dodge a balcony how are you gonna dodge an ostrich!?
30/01/2015, 20:41 - Mike SJ: Lol
30/01/2015, 20:42 - Joe Jarman: Bring shaggy as well
30/01/2015, 20:42 - Mike SJ: He dodged the balcony too well, that was the problem
30/01/2015, 20:42 - Dave: Exaxtly
30/01/2015, 20:42 - Dave: I picked the wring enemy
30/01/2015, 20:42 - Dave: Wrong*
30/01/2015, 20:43 - Dave: Though wringing is appropriate for ostrich fights
30/01/2015, 20:46 - Mike SJ: I think only realistic animal mentioned was Marth, with sloth
30/01/2015, 20:46 - Mike SJ: You cold hearted bastard Marth
30/01/2015, 20:46 - Tegan: Cat is surely realistic
30/01/2015, 20:46 - Mike SJ: Although apparently Max weight for a sloth is like 10kg
30/01/2015, 20:47 - Mike SJ: Humans are really shit at this aren't they?
30/01/2015, 20:49 - Bongo: I've completely lost my voice
30/01/2015, 20:49 - Bongo: It's so annoying
30/01/2015, 20:49 - Martha: No giant sloth?
30/01/2015, 20:50 - Martha: Oscar the obese sloth?
30/01/2015, 20:50 - Bongo: Think shag and I are staying here, he brought round some programmers
30/01/2015, 20:51 - Martha: Oooh wild
30/01/2015, 20:51 - Mike SJ: Rock n roll
30/01/2015, 20:51 - Mike SJ: Lol
30/01/2015, 20:52 - Dave: Sorry to hear you're I'll dude. Rest up, don't programme all night!
30/01/2015, 20:55 - Bongo: Programmers gone wild
30/01/2015, 20:55 - Bongo: Things are going to get all binary up in heyre
30/01/2015, 20:56 - Mike SJ: I sat in an interview for a backend engineering job the other day, the dude used to work for Google in NY and SF
30/01/2015, 20:56 - Mike SJ: He said he was used to coding 15 hrs a day
30/01/2015, 20:57 - Martha: Mike, the shopping list is growing: X yorkshire puds, red vino and pudding. We will repay you in JOY
30/01/2015, 20:57 - Martha: And cash.
30/01/2015, 20:57 - Mike SJ: He was fucking insanely good, but seriously, why?
30/01/2015, 20:57 - Mike SJ: I already left co op
30/01/2015, 20:58 - Dave: What did you get?

30/01/2015, 20:58 - Martha: Well done my man
30/01/2015, 20:58 - Martha: 2 excellent choices out of 3
30/01/2015, 20:59 - Mike SJ: I think Yorkshire puddings count for 2
30/01/2015, 20:59 - Mike SJ: Semantically at least
30/01/2015, 21:03 - Bongo: It depends on what you're doing for those 15 hours
30/01/2015, 21:03 - Bongo: I reckon it's worth it if you're doing something new and interesting all the time
30/01/2015, 21:03 - Bongo: But maybe he was just cookie cutting code the whole time
30/01/2015, 21:07 - Mike SJ: Fuck doing any job on Earth for 15 hours a day
30/01/2015, 21:08 - Mike SJ: Even if my job was doing the shit I'd do in my free time anyway
30/01/2015, 23:05 - Shaggy: <Media omitted>

31/01/2015, 00:00 - Mike SJ: Lol
31/01/2015, 00:00 - Mike SJ: You should live draw our ramblings some time
31/01/2015, 00:02 - Mike SJ: We will pay you in continued friendship
31/01/2015, 00:06 - Bongo: That sounds like more of a threat than an offer lol
31/01/2015, 00:09 - Mike SJ: I believe in a strong stick over carrot approach
31/01/2015, 00:48 - Pete Morey: Isn't the carrot always attached to the stick by a string?
31/01/2015, 00:55 - Mike SJ: Pfft shut up Morey

06/02/2015, 18:21 - Bongo: On the bus, be there in 5 hours
06/02/2015, 18:21 - Bongo: Because that's how bloody long it takes to get anywhere on a bus in London

07/02/2015, 09:14 - Mike SJ: Passed out from the overexertion of texting that
07/02/2015, 09:54 - Bongo: Children of the third world have to walk for 2 hours each day to get fresh water
07/02/2015, 09:54 - Bongo: But that's nothing compared to the harsh climates that some people live in the uk
07/02/2015, 09:54 - Bongo: Donate ¬£2 a month to provide mike with a monkey butler so that he doesn't have to waste energy texting
07/02/2015, 09:56 - Tegan: Can I have a monkey butler for ¬£2 a month?
07/02/2015, 09:56 - Tegan: I'm not after charity, I'll fund my own
07/02/2015, 10:02 - Bongo: Hmm yea I want one too
07/02/2015, 10:03 - Bongo: Screw mike, I'm getting a fleet of monkey butlers
07/02/2015, 10:03 - Bongo: Fleet is the collective noun for monkey butlers right?
07/02/2015, 10:19 - Tegan: Yes
07/02/2015, 18:17 - Mike SJ: Big hero 6 was class!

07/02/2015, 21:40 - Sam Roberts: Looks like a dnd wet dream
07/02/2015, 21:49 - Pete Morey: Basically
10/02/2015, 14:13 - Bongo: That Strauss Khan sex party story is hilarious
10/02/2015, 14:13 - Bongo: "Okay I pimped girls at sex parties, but that was only like 12 times"
10/02/2015, 14:14 - Bongo: And someone else who regularly attended is all like "I was there for professional reasons" lol
10/02/2015, 15:57 - Owen: Give the guy a break he only had 12 sex parties over the course of 3 years. Thats a 3 month wait between sex parties. I have to wait less time between holidays!
10/02/2015, 15:58 - Owen: Also he, and I quote: "did it for fun." We can all sympathise with that nobel aim.
10/02/2015, 15:59 - Tegan: Classy
10/02/2015, 16:00 - Tegan: He was going to be the head of the IMF a few years ago
10/02/2015, 16:00 - Tegan: The IMF could use more sex patios
10/02/2015, 16:00 - Tegan: Parties dammit
10/02/2015, 16:03 - Owen: They face charges of "aggravated pimping." I know aggravated probably has a legal definition but i cannot stop picturing him as some kind of super pimp with mega chains and a massive furry hat.
10/02/2015, 16:04 - Owen: Sex patios also sound good teegs
10/02/2015, 16:11 - Hannah Murphy: Bongo give him some slack - it was 12 parties across three years, so only four a year
10/02/2015, 16:12 - Owen: Repost!!!
10/02/2015, 16:40 - Tegan: Who doesn't throw quarterly sex parties?
10/02/2015, 16:41 - Owen: They sink up with tax day
10/02/2015, 16:46 - Vanessa: Here's my rant, I can't believe after so many years with the 100ml rule at airport security you STILL get people completely dumbfounded when their shampoo gets taken away
10/02/2015, 16:47 - Owen: But I am special so surely the rules don't apply to me.
10/02/2015, 16:48 - Vanessa: Yes, I forgot, it's in the small print
10/02/2015, 17:08 - Shaggy: Oh I thought it's 100ml only for explosive liquids
10/02/2015, 17:27 - Tegan: Yup. Only solid explosives in larger quantities.
10/02/2015, 17:27 - Tegan: Or in they have to be in your checked luggage
10/02/2015, 18:32 - Bongo: And definitely no alan keys right Sam?
10/02/2015, 18:33 - Bongo: You terrorist
10/02/2015, 18:39 - Bongo: 1) who brings an alan key with them on holiday
10/02/2015, 18:40 - Bongo: 2) why does it get banned from taken on the flight
10/02/2015, 18:57 - Shaggy: I had bike tools taken away from me as well
10/02/2015, 20:29 - Sam Roberts: Fascists with their ridiculous rules on bike gear
10/02/2015, 20:30 - Sam Roberts: Must be to limit bike thefts in India

12/02/2015, 13:25 - Tegan: All Sri Lanka lacks is a big group of lads
12/02/2015, 13:26 - Tegan: Or in fact, anyone who isn't a native or a French family
12/02/2015, 13:26 - Dave: You're holding it up for the english

12/02/2015, 13:44 - Tegan: Don't hit him
12/02/2015, 13:44 - Tegan: He had enough stick when he was alive
12/02/2015, 13:45 - Mike SJ: Yeah and you wouldn't like big Jesus when he's angry
12/02/2015, 13:46 - Tegan: Damn right
12/02/2015, 13:46 - Tegan: He is of second coming prop proportions
12/02/2015, 15:35 - Owen: I live!
12/02/2015, 15:53 - Owen: I thought I had killed my phone by rooting it. But i hadn't
12/02/2015, 15:59 - Tegan: Owen!

12/02/2015, 18:33 - Owen: Nah it was too much effort keeping track of everything. It also became a bit distracting because kids would argue for xp.
12/02/2015, 18:33 - Owen: This looks like it will remove those problems.
12/02/2015, 19:23 - Bongo: Cool pic, I can forgive it even though it's in paradise

12/02/2015, 20:32 - Vanessa: I know a couple who actually made up their last name
12/02/2015, 20:32 - Vanessa: I thought that was pretty original
12/02/2015, 20:34 - Shaggy: Did they randomly put their names together with a hyphen in between?
12/02/2015, 20:34 - Vanessa: Nope they actually made a new name using their old names as guidance
12/02/2015, 20:34 - Vanessa: Gordan and Leech to make Leedon

12/02/2015, 20:39 - Shaggy: Omg, it can be Horde
12/02/2015, 20:39 - Shaggy: They missed out
12/02/2015, 20:40 - Shaggy: If I was her husband's mother I would be unhappy too
12/02/2015, 20:45 - Vanessa: Why? Because they should have gone with Horde?
12/02/2015, 21:45 - Owen: Bomes or Jott would be ours

20/02/2015, 15:52 - Alex Bunn: I have finally defeated fomo

20/02/2015, 18:43 - Tegan: Everyone else is lame
20/02/2015, 18:43 - Tegan: Come boogying!
20/02/2015, 18:46 - Lorna: Where're you going to be? And when?

20/02/2015, 23:13 - Owen: 6:30am
20/02/2015, 23:13 - Owen: But if we stay home we will just sleep and that will fuck me up for work
20/02/2015, 23:14 - Krizia: Ahhhhh mexxiiico!  ‚ù§üòçüòçüòç
20/02/2015, 23:14 - Dave: K - my parents may be down but if not then maybe
20/02/2015, 23:14 - Krizia: It's it amazing or wwhhhaaaaattttt? ??
20/02/2015, 23:14 - Krizia: Say Hi to Phil!
20/02/2015, 23:15 - Krizia: Pretty though to stay awake!!
20/02/2015, 23:18 - Owen: Phil says hi too
20/02/2015, 23:19 - Owen: Chinese new year in London is one of the simultaneously best and worst things ever
20/02/2015, 23:19 - Owen: Its like watching a movie that's so bad it's good.
20/02/2015, 23:45 - Mike SJ: Hey that new breaking bad show has started!
20/02/2015, 23:45 - Mike SJ: Better call Saul... Has anyone watched it?
21/02/2015, 00:00 - Bongo: Yep
21/02/2015, 00:00 - Bongo: Pretty good
21/02/2015, 00:00 - Bongo: Not nearly as good as breaking bad
21/02/2015, 10:12 - Mike SJ: Yeah it's not bad so far
21/02/2015, 10:12 - Mike SJ: Less funny madcaps than I was expecting
21/02/2015, 11:20 - Pete Morey: I like it,  s'good...  Basically pre-bb Saul is pre cancer Walt
21/02/2015, 11:21 - Pete Morey: Same premise + arc,  but it's a good one so worth repeating
21/02/2015, 11:23 - Mike SJ: I dunno, slip and fall Saul?
21/02/2015, 11:24 - Mike SJ: He's pretty devious from the start
21/02/2015, 12:02 - Pete Morey: Yeah true
21/02/2015, 12:03 - Pete Morey: Slippin Jimmy
21/02/2015, 12:04 - Pete Morey: I'm shutting up about it now, in case spoilers etc
21/02/2015, 12:06 - Pete Morey: Random pc question for anyone who might be able to help:
21/02/2015, 12:09 - Mike SJ: Turn it off and on again
21/02/2015, 12:11 - Pete Morey: I just bought pc and ssd - I wanna put the os on the ssd but it has come pre loaded on the hdd. No installation disk and any legit online source for installation is an 'update' rather than original install.  Anywhere I can get a windows 8 installation?  Any other suggestions about how to proceed??
21/02/2015, 12:11 - Pete Morey: Sorry:I tried bashing with a rock already
21/02/2015, 12:17 - Mike SJ: Are you sure you want windows 8?
21/02/2015, 12:17 - Mike SJ: I've heard it's weird
21/02/2015, 12:18 - Pete Morey: Yeah it's weird... Too late now I got it
21/02/2015, 12:19 - Pete Morey: It tries to turn windows into an app system or smt
21/02/2015, 12:20 - Pete Morey: It's my cheapest option cos I got a product key with the pc
21/02/2015, 12:22 - Sam Roberts: We've got a Windows 7 bit usb with a crack somewhere, can use that
21/02/2015, 12:23 - Sam Roberts: If you're on 8, get the 8.1 update and you can run a proper desktop. All the panel stuff is weak unless you're using it as a touch screen
21/02/2015, 12:23 - Pete Morey: Yeah?
21/02/2015, 12:23 - Pete Morey: Or maybe I could transfer 7 from my old laptop
21/02/2015, 12:23 - Pete Morey: I'm checking that out now
21/02/2015, 12:24 - Pete Morey: How do I get the 7 windows of ye Sam?
21/02/2015, 12:28 - Pete Morey: Oh yeah I have 8.1 sorry yeah
21/02/2015, 12:32 - Sam Roberts: I've got to do mine sometime, Windows party Monday night?
21/02/2015, 12:34 - Pete Morey: Haha sounds fun.  I might have a solution from my housemate by then,  but YES in principle.  How does a windows party work then?
21/02/2015, 12:38 - Sam Roberts: You come round about 8, we celebrate everything Windows
21/02/2015, 12:38 - Sam Roberts: Looking out of them, opening, closing, the LOT
21/02/2015, 12:39 - Pete Morey: .. Maybe we could put our pc s together in a room/pit and encourage them to kiss
21/02/2015, 12:39 - Pete Morey: ... And/or fight...
21/02/2015, 12:40 - Pete Morey: We could take bets
21/02/2015, 12:40 - Pete Morey: On outcomes etc
21/02/2015, 12:41 - Pete Morey: Godammit this isn't helping with my OS/Ssd problem at all...
21/02/2015, 12:43 - Pete Morey: (it takes me two hours to get to canning town btw.  We'd best have the windows party at a decent mid point.  Or mine.)
21/02/2015, 12:47 - Sam Roberts: <Media omitted>
21/02/2015, 12:48 - Pete Morey: <Media omitted>
21/02/2015, 12:49 - Bongo: For some reason I read that as visual communication helps thinking
21/02/2015, 12:49 - Pete Morey: It does!
21/02/2015, 12:51 - Pete Morey: .. But maybe not when trying to plan a windows party w sam
21/02/2015, 12:51 - Pete Morey: Especially in negotiating a venue that isn't Sam's place...
21/02/2015, 12:57 - Bongo: Yea that sucks just go with 7
21/02/2015, 13:29 - Shaggy: Sam I think mentioned about some utility that moves windows over? Did you try it last time you messed with your PC? Clean install would be best anyways, your PC probably comes with a bunch of preinstalled bullshit anyway. How big is the ssd?
21/02/2015, 13:42 - Pete Morey: Oh hey.  Yeah ideally I want clean install but my pc didn't come with install disk
21/02/2015, 13:43 - Pete Morey: So I got the product key from the pc and am looking for a standard install iso online
21/02/2015, 13:43 - Pete Morey: Actually,  I would prefer a USB install
21/02/2015, 13:44 - Pete Morey: Cos I don't have did drive
21/02/2015, 13:44 - Shaggy: You need to pirate that shit, you won't find one to download
21/02/2015, 13:44 - Pete Morey: The ssd is 120gigs
21/02/2015, 13:44 - Shaggy: Ok that's enough for windows
21/02/2015, 13:44 - Pete Morey: *DVD
21/02/2015, 13:45 - Pete Morey: Yeah I thought so.  Windows plus Adobe and office programs I hope
21/02/2015, 13:46 - Pete Morey: Can I not just use a standard install cd as long as I have the product key?
21/02/2015, 13:46 - Pete Morey: (which is downloadable)
21/02/2015, 13:47 - Pete Morey: (or I thought it would be)
21/02/2015, 13:47 - Shaggy: It's not
21/02/2015, 13:47 - Pete Morey: Wow that's shit
21/02/2015, 13:47 - Shaggy: Yup
21/02/2015, 13:48 - Pete Morey: Can I not just use someone else's install cd then?  No crack needed cos I have legit cd key
21/02/2015, 13:52 - Shaggy: Don't have windows 8, 'm afraid
21/02/2015, 13:54 - Pete Morey: 8.1?
21/02/2015, 13:54 - Shaggy: Same thing
21/02/2015, 13:55 - Pete Morey: Bum bum
21/02/2015, 13:55 - Pete Morey: What about transfer from hdd to ssd?
21/02/2015, 13:55 - Pete Morey: I'll go away do some research now...
21/02/2015, 13:57 - Dave: Take it to nerdgasm people
21/02/2015, 14:04 - Pete Morey: Nerdgasm?
21/02/2015, 14:14 - Dave: It's a dark world where discussions on computers take place
21/02/2015, 14:28 - Pete Morey: Oh OK.  I could join that if I wasn't immediately 'noobed'  or smt
21/02/2015, 14:28 - Pete Morey: 'hazed'
21/02/2015, 14:28 - Pete Morey: 'bummed'
21/02/2015, 14:41 - Pete Morey: Cool,  conversation moved
21/02/2015, 14:41 - Pete Morey: On another note: Joe little is back in london
21/02/2015, 14:41 - Pete Morey: And on whatsapp

21/02/2015, 16:54 - Bongo: Pretty decent
21/02/2015, 16:54 - Bongo: Shaggy has unparalleled wanking experience so his wrists are on another level
21/02/2015, 16:56 - Bongo: Come play some time dude, it's on the way from the station to our place
21/02/2015, 17:01 - Dave: Sounds ace
21/02/2015, 17:26 - Sam Roberts: So up for some foosball. Can we have an evening of that, and the Peruvian steak house to finish?

26/02/2015, 16:34 - Mike SJ: I had a five guys burger for lunch and I'm still feeling drowsy now
26/02/2015, 16:34 - Mike SJ: Those things are ridiculous
26/02/2015, 16:54 - Alex Bunn: Mmm so good
26/02/2015, 17:08 - Owen: Five guys. I thought they were exclusively American.
26/02/2015, 17:10 - Angela: Loads of people in my office were eating those for lunch, even though it took them 20 mins on the bus to get there
26/02/2015, 17:25 - Mike SJ: I kind of wanted to die when I finished it
26/02/2015, 17:25 - Mike SJ: In a good way

26/02/2015, 18:04 - Dave: üçï
26/02/2015, 18:31 - Sam Roberts: üçùüçõ
26/02/2015, 18:31 - Dave: I'm actually pretty hungry now
27/02/2015, 09:26 - Alex Bunn: <Media omitted>
27/02/2015, 10:14 - Mike SJ: Walking Tall - yeah that pretty much sums it up!
27/02/2015, 10:15 - Mike SJ: I think even Phil admitted that wasn't a great film
27/02/2015, 10:28 - Joe Jarman: Absolute donut fest at work today
27/02/2015, 10:29 - Joe Jarman: Never have so many krispy kreams been in one office at one time
27/02/2015, 10:39 - Alex Bunn: How many have you had so far?
27/02/2015, 10:39 - Alex Bunn: Go for 10
27/02/2015, 10:43 - Joe Jarman: I'm easing myself in
27/02/2015, 10:45 - Mike SJ: To a donut? Sounds dirty
27/02/2015, 11:22 - Shaggy: Fucking a donut must be sweet
27/02/2015, 11:37 - Alex Bunn: Mmmmmmm
27/02/2015, 11:37 - Alex Bunn: Donuts
27/02/2015, 11:40 - Alex Bunn: <Media omitted>
27/02/2015, 12:15 - Mike SJ: <Media omitted>
27/02/2015, 12:15 - Mike SJ: White and gold, or blue and black?
27/02/2015, 12:15 - Mike SJ: http://gizmodo.com/what-the-fuck-is-wrong-with-your-eyes-a-dress-explaine-1688364883
27/02/2015, 12:16 - Mike SJ: Fucking weird, loads of people at work see it as white and gold üò¶
27/02/2015, 12:23 - Alex Bunn: Depends on the photo
27/02/2015, 12:23 - Alex Bunn: And the camera exposure
27/02/2015, 12:28 - Mike SJ: Unless you think it has a blue filter on it, I don't know how you can see that as white
27/02/2015, 12:30 - Alex Bunn: Its not
27/02/2015, 12:30 - Alex Bunn: But iv seen other photos where its def white
27/02/2015, 12:32 - Krizia: White
27/02/2015, 12:32 - Vanessa: Yea it depends which phone you're looking at
27/02/2015, 12:33 - Vanessa: I've seen it both
27/02/2015, 12:33 - Krizia: <Media omitted>
27/02/2015, 12:34 - Krizia: That's from my mexi friends
27/02/2015, 12:34 - Krizia: It says I saw it blue and black and then white and gold hahahah
27/02/2015, 12:41 - Sam Roberts: I can see why Phil likes it over there now ;)
27/02/2015, 12:42 - Sam Roberts: Everyone seeing it as blue now? I got it from someone at work earlier, on the pc I could make it change by concentrating
27/02/2015, 12:42 - Sam Roberts: It really messed me up for ten minutes
27/02/2015, 12:44 - Shaggy: What? It totally white and gold
27/02/2015, 12:45 - Pete Morey: I'm gettin b+b
27/02/2015, 12:51 - Dave: Blue and black (the dress, right?)
27/02/2015, 12:56 - Eliza: So I saw this online, and I know the dress is blue and black and I know this isn't a weird conspiracy or practical joke. But goddamn I can't for the life of me see it as anything other than a white and gold dress in shadow.
27/02/2015, 12:57 - Owen: Wow!
27/02/2015, 12:58 - Pete Morey: Freaky...  So it's a screen thing?
27/02/2015, 12:58 - Owen: Does the white in shadow look at all blue to you?
27/02/2015, 12:58 - Sam Roberts: Not a screen thing
27/02/2015, 12:59 - Sam Roberts: It's a mind thing
27/02/2015, 12:59 - Owen: It's a colour perception thing
27/02/2015, 12:59 - Sam Roberts: What even are eyes?
27/02/2015, 12:59 - Eliza: Yes, it looks like blueish shadow. But it looks like the dress should be white (and gold) in proper lighting.
27/02/2015, 13:00 - Owen: What colour do the highlights on the blue look like?
27/02/2015, 13:00 - Owen: Also come open the door!
27/02/2015, 13:01 - Pete Morey: Wow
27/02/2015, 13:02 - Pete Morey: But the screen doesn't contribute at all??
27/02/2015, 13:12 - Sam Roberts: This one looks a lot more blue than on the computer. Unless I put them next to each other...
27/02/2015, 13:15 - Vanessa: On the left side there is a two tone clothing behind the dress, what colours do people see and is it the same as the main dress?
27/02/2015, 13:20 - Shaggy: <Media omitted>
27/02/2015, 13:24 - Pete Morey: So is it to do with colour blindness or is a more nuanced aspect of,  for eg,  complementary colour perception? (within an ordinary range)
27/02/2015, 13:26 - Hannah Murphy: Eyes: what are?
27/02/2015, 13:31 - Mike SJ: The one I posted is the original and there are a lot of people who see white and gold even if you mess about with the brightness etc.
27/02/2015, 13:31 - Mike SJ: It's probly something to do with rods and cones in the eye
27/02/2015, 13:32 - Owen: Possibly people with fewer blue cones see white and gold.
27/02/2015, 13:34 - Mike SJ: <Media omitted>
27/02/2015, 13:37 - Owen: The dress is the same blue in both examples.
27/02/2015, 13:45 - Alex Bunn: Just went back to the photo. Its changed colour
27/02/2015, 13:46 - Sam Roberts: I read a thing saying it's not in the eye ie rods and cones, apparently there's a massive range of proportions naturally that has almost no impact on colour perception
27/02/2015, 13:46 - Sam Roberts: I call Kant
27/02/2015, 13:48 - Mike SJ: This is like the biggest thing on the internet in a long time üò¶
27/02/2015, 13:48 - Vanessa: I think this is basically an experiment to prove the point that nobody sees things the same way
27/02/2015, 13:54 - Mike SJ: I don't think it was an experiment, someone just posted the picture on Facebook and it's completely exploded
27/02/2015, 14:12 - Sam Roberts: Everyone going to this comedy tonight? Where is it?
27/02/2015, 14:22 - Pete Morey: <Media omitted>

27/02/2015, 18:34 - Vanessa: I'm aiming for 7:30 towards 8pm
27/02/2015, 19:09 - Sam Roberts: Think I've missed the comedy now. Going to stay at home and drink lemsip instead, enjoy the show!

27/02/2015, 19:54 - Vanessa: I'm going to have to bail

03/03/2015, 14:40 - Shaggy: Which basically a 6 sided die with any two numbers for the three options
03/03/2015, 15:36 - Owen: I can
03/03/2015, 15:38 - Mike SJ: Or get a 3 sided dreidel!
03/03/2015, 15:38 - Mike SJ: #notjewish
03/03/2015, 16:40 - Owen: Are there any regular 3 sided 3D shapes?
03/03/2015, 16:40 - Owen: With flat plane surfaces?
03/03/2015, 16:40 - Owen: What about irregular?
03/03/2015, 16:43 - Shaggy: Cylinder is 3 sided
03/03/2015, 16:44 - Dave: üëè
03/03/2015, 16:44 - Owen: Nice
03/03/2015, 16:46 - Shaggy: I'm guessing it should be possible to design it so that it's equally likely to land any side up?
03/03/2015, 17:23 - Owen: Well a massive curved face will be landed on way more often than 1/3. A really thin curved face (like a coin) will almost never be landed on. So somewhere in between must be a size of face which is landed on 1/3rd of the time.
03/03/2015, 17:24 - Owen: Unless somehow the probability is quantized which i would find very difficult to belive
03/03/2015, 18:02 - Mike SJ: Anyone up for pub in Clapham? Wana leave work now

07/03/2015, 18:12 - Mike SJ: Just about to put BBQ on
07/03/2015, 18:12 - Mike SJ: Who else is coming?
07/03/2015, 18:15 - Shaggy: I was just trolling about the BBQ, didn't know you'll go along with it
07/03/2015, 18:25 - Eliza: We'll be there in about 40minutes for whatever is or isn't happening. Apart from not pies, let us know what we should bring.
07/03/2015, 18:28 - Mike SJ: Yeah let's BBQ some pies!

07/03/2015, 18:29 - Eliza: But ok, we'll get some pies.
07/03/2015, 18:29 - Mike SJ: I was lying about putting the BBQ on btw
07/03/2015, 18:29 - Mike SJ: Trying to create urgency
07/03/2015, 18:46 - Mike SJ: Buy an assortment of pies, let's all have a 3 course meal of pies
07/03/2015, 18:47 - Mike SJ: We'll give you moneys

07/03/2015, 18:57 - Eliza: No BBQ stuff? Just pies? How many people are eating?
07/03/2015, 18:57 - Mike SJ: 6
07/03/2015, 18:57 - Eliza: Do you have pie dishes? O might cook some from scratch:
07/03/2015, 18:58 - Mike SJ: OK, needs to be veg though
07/03/2015, 18:58 - Mike SJ: Also get dessert pies
07/03/2015, 18:59 - Mike SJ: And like pie soup or something for starter
07/03/2015, 19:00 - Eliza: Only one pie dish? Or could we make one meat one veg?
07/03/2015, 19:03 - Mike SJ: One, fairly big, probly should get some potatoes or something though
07/03/2015, 19:03 - Alex Bunn: One gigantic pie
07/03/2015, 19:04 - Eliza: One big veg pie then.

07/03/2015, 19:13 - Mike SJ: Also we are low on the secret ingredient of beer
07/03/2015, 19:13 - Eliza: How has this turned from us coming over for a BBQ to us cooking you all dinner and restocking your pantry?!
07/03/2015, 19:15 - Mike SJ: Oldest trick in the book
07/03/2015, 19:16 - Eliza: If you want beer too someone's going to have to leave the house to help us carry all this. Vegetables are heavy.
07/03/2015, 19:17 - Tegan: Where are you Lize?
07/03/2015, 19:17 - Eliza: Co-op
07/03/2015, 19:17 - Tegan: I'll rally to the flag
07/03/2015, 19:18 - Eliza: Thank you lovely.
07/03/2015, 19:31 - Mike SJ: So you're bringing beer right?
07/03/2015, 19:31 - Tegan: Shuttup Mike

07/03/2015, 20:32 - Mike SJ: We just accidentally started going through Phil's fb photos

09/03/2015, 09:33 - Sam Roberts: That's how I remember it
09/03/2015, 09:34 - Sam Roberts: That and arguing with shaggy about archers
09/03/2015, 09:34 - Sam Roberts: One of my favorite cinema experiences of the year
09/03/2015, 09:34 - Pete Morey: It was good
09/03/2015, 09:34 - Pete Morey: Stoopid good fun
09/03/2015, 09:35 - Pete Morey: But was it Reg-ee-na or Reg-eye - na?
09/03/2015, 09:35 - Sam Roberts: Anyone know what film that 'the rock hits shit with a 2x4' was based on?
09/03/2015, 09:50 - Mike SJ: Walking Tall
09/03/2015, 09:50 - Mike SJ: We watched it, it was awful
09/03/2015, 10:09 - Sam Roberts: 3 beers and a laugh awful? Or just bad awful?
09/03/2015, 10:17 - Owen: Did phil like it? When it comes to dwayne "the rock" johnson there is no greater authority than Phil "the Phil" Tschismarov
09/03/2015, 10:19 - Tegan: The Phil had very different parameters of awfulness
09/03/2015, 10:20 - Tegan: He actively enjoys the music of Bob Seger
09/03/2015, 10:20 - Owen: His legitimately favourite film is "dredd"
09/03/2015, 10:20 - Tegan: Lol
09/03/2015, 10:20 - Tegan: I miss the Phil
09/03/2015, 10:21 - Owen: Me and eliza spent half of Mexico trying to convince him he was wrong.
09/03/2015, 10:21 - Owen: He describes that movie as "perfect"
09/03/2015, 13:07 - Eliza: Not sure if serious or satire - but either way, pretty funny. www.wikihow.com/be-cool-so-girls-notice-you I love wikihow.
09/03/2015, 13:11 - Tegan: I like the way this combines sensible life advice with really badass stuff like fighting and not thinking about power rangers to much
09/03/2015, 13:28 - Pete Morey: Hehehe

10/03/2015, 12:31 - Tegan: Is that what one of those looks like

12/03/2015, 10:38 - Joe Jarman: Yeah I know I've just been searching for mouse on whatsapp everywhere and no hits!!
12/03/2015, 10:38 - Joe Jarman: Think it might be a house bants ting
12/03/2015, 10:38 - Joe Jarman: Let's go dave
12/03/2015, 10:38 - Joe Jarman: Saturday @ the forum
12/03/2015, 10:39 - Joe Jarman: No booking fee on songkick

12/03/2015, 10:46 - Dave: If so then no can do
12/03/2015, 10:46 - Dave: I'm in leeds
12/03/2015, 11:13 - Pete Morey: <Media omitted>
12/03/2015, 11:21 - Owen: I am ashamed but I had to google non sequitur
12/03/2015, 11:22 - Owen: It's one of those words I understand when it is used but didn't know the definition of.
12/03/2015, 11:26 - Pete Morey: But is it 'non seck-wit-terrrr'  or 'non seckwitter'?
12/03/2015, 12:20 - Jimena: Why be ashamed? In some circles i know 'knowlege' of that sort is just another accessory people flaunt to raise themselves above others
12/03/2015, 12:21 - Jimena: Fuck the pretentiousness. The important things in life can be understood and discussed in simple words.
12/03/2015, 12:27 - Jimena: Of course i love words. And choosing the best one. But they are just the clothes that dress our ideas.
12/03/2015, 12:27 - Jimena: But thats just me ranting. So what DOES non sequitur mean üòÅ
12/03/2015, 12:43 - Pete Morey: It means 'random non related thing in sequence',  unconnected thing etc etc
12/03/2015, 12:43 - Pete Morey: It's a roof made of owls...
12/03/2015, 12:55 - Jimena: Ah like the 2 penguins are in the shower and one drops the soap joke
12/03/2015, 12:57 - Jimena: And then other penguin looks at him and says... "What do you think i am?! A shoe?!"
12/03/2015, 13:08 - Pete Morey: Yeah zackly
12/03/2015, 13:09 - Pete Morey: ...  Wait I don't geddit :p
12/03/2015, 13:10 - Pete Morey: ...  You know there's a no fly zone in Antarctica where loads of penguins live
12/03/2015, 13:10 - Pete Morey: ...  They kept looking up to see the planes,  following them with their heads and then falling on their backs
12/03/2015, 13:11 - Pete Morey: ...  Apparently penguins can't get up
12/03/2015, 13:11 - Pete Morey: So if your one picked up the soap he'd probably die
12/03/2015, 13:11 - Pete Morey: After being buggered
12/03/2015, 13:12 - Pete Morey: ....  So what's black and white and clean and red all over?
12/03/2015, 13:19 - Shaggy: That's the dumbest thing I've heard
12/03/2015, 13:20 - Shaggy: Penguins fall over all the time, they are clumsier than pandas
12/03/2015, 13:24 - Pete Morey: Wha?!  No way!!  -  pandas fall out of TREES.
12/03/2015, 13:25 - Shaggy: That's because trees are tricker than just standing on flat ground, believe it or not
12/03/2015, 13:26 - Pete Morey: And they're nearly extinct,  cos the male panda can't coordinate his winky into the fu-fu
12/03/2015, 13:26 - Shaggy: No man can do that
12/03/2015, 13:26 - Pete Morey: I bet penguins could
12/03/2015, 13:28 - Pete Morey: ..  Ask the one who picked up the soap
12/03/2015, 14:33 - Jimena: Fu-fu? Really? That's a new one for me
12/03/2015, 14:35 - Jimena: And i've heard it called a bunch of things: chichino, punani, mushy and the ever so crude 'beefcurtains' among others
12/03/2015, 14:38 - Jimena: Also how does picking up the soap equal falling over? Can they not pick things up either? Cause i cant fathom how a being that cant get up or pick up soap like things survives
12/03/2015, 14:40 - Tegan: I bet they could pick up the soap underwater
12/03/2015, 14:41 - Tegan: Maybe a creature more suited to baths...
12/03/2015, 15:25 - Mike SJ: Aw, Terry Pratchett
12/03/2015, 15:25 - Mike SJ: That sucks
12/03/2015, 15:52 - Tegan: That is sad
12/03/2015, 15:52 - Tegan: Only 66... But he's looked about 150 forever...
12/03/2015, 16:09 - Sam Roberts: Great books, Great man
12/03/2015, 16:13 - Jimena: Noooooo
12/03/2015, 16:14 - Jimena: üò≠
12/03/2015, 16:22 - Jimena: <Media omitted>
12/03/2015, 20:22 - Mike SJ: In good news, Bill Watterson released his first book in like 15 years today!
12/03/2015, 20:22 - Mike SJ: <Media omitted>
12/03/2015, 20:38 - Bongo: No way!
12/03/2015, 20:38 - Bongo: That front cover looks suspiciously like one of his other ones though
12/03/2015, 21:01 - Mike SJ: It's not exactly a new anthology, more a retrospective
12/03/2015, 21:01 - Mike SJ: Only like ¬£10 on Amazon
12/03/2015, 21:02 - Mike SJ: Also the new mouse outfit album was awesome, bring on Saturday!
13/03/2015, 08:18 - Mike SJ: Don't forget Mother's day
13/03/2015, 08:51 - Shaggy: Your mother asked me to remind you, but looks like you're a good boy
13/03/2015, 09:11 - Mike Joyce: I actually forgot. ..i am terrible! !
13/03/2015, 09:14 - Dave: I made a scary card for my mum. She'll be so proud
13/03/2015, 09:30 - Joe Jarman: You can still make it if you post today!!!
13/03/2015, 10:22 - Pete Morey: Shit!
13/03/2015, 11:04 - Owen: A horse walks into a bar. The bartender asks the horse if it's an alcoholic considering all the bars he frequents, to which the horse replies "I don't think I am." POOF! The horse disappears. 

This is the point in time when all the philosophy students in the audience begin to giggle, as they are familiar with the philosophical proposition of Cogito ergo sum, or I think, therefore, I am.

But to explain the concept aforehand would be putting Descartes before the horse.
13/03/2015, 11:14 - Mike SJ: There was a really old askreddit thread about a guy who was genuinely in the same philosophy class as a porn star. Someone made a comment about not putting Descartes before the whores
13/03/2015, 11:15 - Mike SJ: It was the best reddit comment of all time
13/03/2015, 11:38 - Tegan: Right place right time, I guess
13/03/2015, 11:38 - Tegan: You can't plan for that shiz
13/03/2015, 19:08 - Mike SJ: Wooooo
13/03/2015, 19:08 - Mike SJ: Friday
13/03/2015, 19:08 - Dave: Yay!

13/03/2015, 19:52 - Vinay: That is an amazing picture
13/03/2015, 19:53 - Tegan: It is one of the best things that had ever happened
13/03/2015, 19:54 - Tegan: Although apparently the baby critter is not trying to whimsically travel aboard the woodpecker, but to maim and kill it
13/03/2015, 19:54 - Vinay: I don't know the rodent / mammal that's on the bird
13/03/2015, 20:04 - Tegan: Internet says it's a weasel
13/03/2015, 20:04 - Mike SJ: Lol I was gona post that one
13/03/2015, 20:04 - Mike SJ: Woodpecker lived apparently
13/03/2015, 20:06 - Shaggy: It did live, I watched the interview with the guy that filmed it
13/03/2015, 20:06 - Shaggy: Or took a picture anyway
13/03/2015, 20:08 - Tegan: I watched an interview with the woodpecker
13/03/2015, 20:08 - Tegan: He was like, woooooaaaaah
13/03/2015, 20:09 - Mike SJ: The woodpecker?
13/03/2015, 20:09 - Shaggy: The weasel
13/03/2015, 20:11 - Vinay: Haha I thought you were going to say the same thing too, interview with the woodpecker
13/03/2015, 20:11 - Bongo: I wonder how many jokes have been made about riding a woodpecker after that picture was taken
13/03/2015, 20:13 - Vinay: http://cdn-test.healthunlocked.com/misc/sadie-breakfast-2015-03-13.gif

13/03/2015, 20:23 - Shaggy: See?!? Instant rec
13/03/2015, 20:23 - Shaggy: When I laughed out loud everyone gave me a weird look
13/03/2015, 20:24 - Shaggy: Apparently Sadie insisted on that shape
13/03/2015, 20:24 - Bongo: And the top one being a different colour

14/03/2015, 13:47 - Sam Roberts: The tickets are in pairs right? Who's Joe's homie?
14/03/2015, 13:48 - Sam Roberts: Kind of agree shag, way more relaxed. Only heard it a couple of times though, the first one was a grower for me
14/03/2015, 15:06 - Joe Jarman: I bought one on the interwebs

20/03/2015, 10:19 - Tegan: Beer
20/03/2015, 10:20 - Mike Joyce: I always drink bet on the pave....costs allot because i lose
20/03/2015, 10:22 - Tegan: Well exactly
20/03/2015, 10:22 - Tegan: But why pave extra for the pave to drink the costly bet?
20/03/2015, 10:22 - Tegan: That's what I'm asking
20/03/2015, 10:24 - Mike Joyce: I see your point but its all about the thrill of coins on concrete

21/03/2015, 10:25 - Mike Joyce: Im so happy for you shaggy
21/03/2015, 10:47 - Tegan: On a slightly more high brow note
21/03/2015, 10:48 - Tegan: Does anyone want to read Development as Freedom with us? We're planning a wee reading group
21/03/2015, 10:57 - Angela: I will!
21/03/2015, 11:01 - Angela: Not sure I can keep up with you though teegs, when are you reading it by?
21/03/2015, 11:03 - Tegan: Hoorah!
21/03/2015, 11:05 - Tegan: I think we're going to take it slowly
21/03/2015, 11:05 - Tegan: You know
21/03/2015, 11:05 - Tegan: Romantic like
21/03/2015, 11:13 - Eliza: Ohh, count me in too!
21/03/2015, 11:14 - Tegan: Sweet!
21/03/2015, 11:39 - Pete Morey: What is development through freedom?
21/03/2015, 11:39 - Pete Morey: Sounds int 'restin
21/03/2015, 16:46 - Mike SJ: On a slightly more low brow note
21/03/2015, 16:47 - Mike SJ: ENGERLAAND üáΩüá™

22/03/2015, 11:54 - Mike SJ: Not feeling wonderful
22/03/2015, 11:55 - Mike SJ: Sorry bout the carpet

24/03/2015, 15:21 - Mike Joyce: I haven't even seen game of throwns but the "explain" cartoon made me laugh. It reminds me of something shaggy would say in real life
24/03/2015, 16:30 - Jimena: Its the stories of the lives and (mostly) deaths of the members of different clans in a medieval type fantasy world as they prepare for winter to come where winter lasts for years and years and brings with it deadly monsters and their ever growing army of undead.
24/03/2015, 16:32 - Jimena: And there's 3 dragons but they are kids and everyone is also waiting for them to grow and multiply.
24/03/2015, 16:32 - Mike Joyce: Sounds just like where i grew up
24/03/2015, 16:32 - Jimena: Lol

24/03/2015, 16:44 - Owen: Is that sam?

24/03/2015, 16:47 - Mike SJ: <Media omitted>
24/03/2015, 16:47 - Mike SJ: First hit on google
24/03/2015, 16:47 - Mike SJ: Apparently he lives in London as well, you should meet up!
24/03/2015, 16:48 - Krizia: Nooooo he is not that handsome as Sam!!!
24/03/2015, 16:48 - Krizia: üòçüòçüòçüòç
24/03/2015, 16:48 - Pete Morey: He certainly takes your breath away...
24/03/2015, 16:50 - Owen: He looks less like sam in that second photo and more like a young Robert deniro
24/03/2015, 16:53 - Mike SJ: <Media omitted>
24/03/2015, 17:08 - Sam Roberts: Too old
24/03/2015, 17:08 - Alex Bunn: Are you stalking him now Mike?
24/03/2015, 17:12 - Mike SJ: Any distraction will do today
24/03/2015, 17:13 - Mike Joyce: Definite love child
24/03/2015, 17:16 - Tegan: That was also my conclusion
24/03/2015, 17:16 - Tegan: Who is this lovechild and why do you have so many candid snaps of him?
24/03/2015, 17:17 - Sam Roberts: Cheers for clearing it up though, I spent ages trying to remember when I took that first one!
24/03/2015, 17:31 - Jimena: As someone who hasn't seen Sam in 7 years, the selfies made me think he wasn't aging so well üòÅ
24/03/2015, 17:43 - Mike Joyce: Ha ha
24/03/2015, 17:45 - Mike Joyce: Samad (Sam and Ahmad's love child) would be sadened by your comments

24/03/2015, 17:59 - Mike Joyce: Dammn i know in real life ahmad has this exact expression but cant find photo of it!!
24/03/2015, 18:03 - Mike SJ: Sam used a face-thinning app on that last picture

24/03/2015, 21:04 - Mike Joyce: Bongo man. Youve really let youself go....to much raw bacon
24/03/2015, 22:44 - Owen: Mike do you have a doublechin and neck beard app or something?
24/03/2015, 23:52 - Martha: Mike please can you do that to more faces?
24/03/2015, 23:53 - Martha: There's a horde data viz somewhere in there I'm sure.

25/03/2015, 12:18 - Vanessa: Are they trying to do a world record on how many movies they can make on the same story?
25/03/2015, 12:19 - Alex Bunn: Fast and furious 6 was actually really good
25/03/2015, 12:19 - Alex Bunn: TIL there's a sharknado 3 and possibly a sharknado 4
25/03/2015, 12:24 - Vanessa: I don't even know what sharknado is
25/03/2015, 12:25 - Alex Bunn: Can you make a guess?
25/03/2015, 12:30 - Vanessa: I've just googled
25/03/2015, 12:30 - Vanessa: Seriously?! And it's 82% on rotten tomato
25/03/2015, 12:32 - Joe Jarman: I can't believe you had to google that to work out what it was about
25/03/2015, 12:32 - Joe Jarman: The title sharknado... Nuff said!!!!
25/03/2015, 12:36 - Joe Jarman: Whatsapp call feature is now working
25/03/2015, 12:45 - Tegan: It's just a cam through your carrier though
25/03/2015, 12:45 - Tegan: Call
25/03/2015, 12:45 - Tegan: Not over the Internet
25/03/2015, 12:49 - Joe Jarman: It's over the internet
25/03/2015, 12:49 - Joe Jarman: Not through your carrier
25/03/2015, 12:49 - Tegan: Must be an upgrade
25/03/2015, 12:50 - Joe Jarman: Yes
25/03/2015, 12:50 - Joe Jarman: There you go
25/03/2015, 12:50 - Joe Jarman: I called you from it
25/03/2015, 12:50 - Tegan: Got it :)
25/03/2015, 12:51 - Tegan: Poor old mobile network operators
25/03/2015, 12:52 - Joe Jarman: Next thing to get banned left right and centre...
25/03/2015, 12:52 - Joe Jarman: I can't see a reason to have minutes now on my ‚òé
25/03/2015, 12:53 - Tegan: But skype does this
25/03/2015, 12:53 - Tegan: And I still use minutes
25/03/2015, 12:55 - Joe Jarman: Skype doesn't have your entire phonebook loaded in with everyone constantly online
25/03/2015, 12:56 - Joe Jarman: You have to arrange a skype generally...
25/03/2015, 13:59 - Alex Bunn: Furure
25/03/2015, 13:59 - Alex Bunn: Future*
25/03/2015, 13:59 - Alex Bunn: Lol
25/03/2015, 15:02 - Alex Bunn: Mmm just got given a free donut from a random dude in the office
25/03/2015, 15:02 - Alex Bunn: He was walking round with a box of krispie kremes and was just handing them out
25/03/2015, 15:02 - Alex Bunn: Nom
25/03/2015, 15:02 - Henry Dranks: I just watched fast and furious 6 on your recommendation bunn, good call
25/03/2015, 15:03 - Alex Bunn: Lol! Are you not at work today?!
25/03/2015, 15:03 - Alex Bunn: Ps that runway scene is ridiculous
25/03/2015, 15:03 - Henry Dranks: Im all manfluey :(
25/03/2015, 15:03 - Henry Dranks: Haha yea its gotta be at least 20 miles long
25/03/2015, 15:03 - Henry Dranks: And that jump off the tank made me piss myself laughing
25/03/2015, 15:04 - Alex Bunn: Now watch sharknado 3
25/03/2015, 15:04 - Henry Dranks: Good plan
25/03/2015, 15:05 - Alex Bunn: And backdoor sluts 9
25/03/2015, 15:06 - Henry Dranks: Ill have to watch 1-8 first
25/03/2015, 15:08 - Alex Bunn: You dont have to
25/03/2015, 15:08 - Alex Bunn: But you can if you want
25/03/2015, 15:09 - Henry Dranks: What about sharknado 1-2
25/03/2015, 15:09 - Henry Dranks: Do I need them for plot points
25/03/2015, 15:09 - Henry Dranks: These are all important considerations
25/03/2015, 15:09 - Alex Bunn: Well you survived fast and furious 6 without fast and furious tokyo drift didnt you?
25/03/2015, 15:10 - Henry Dranks: Nah ive seen that!
25/03/2015, 15:10 - Alex Bunn: Lol of course!
25/03/2015, 15:10 - Henry Dranks: Was terrible tho
25/03/2015, 15:10 - Alex Bunn: Cos it didnt have the rock
25/03/2015, 15:11 - Henry Dranks: Yea pretty much
25/03/2015, 15:11 - Henry Dranks: His eyebrow acting is amazing
25/03/2015, 15:12 - Alex Bunn: <Media omitted>
25/03/2015, 15:13 - Alex Bunn: Damn straight
25/03/2015, 15:39 - Mike SJ: Jump off the tank was one of the greatest moments in cinema history
25/03/2015, 15:47 - Alex Bunn: I want to rewatch that film now
25/03/2015, 16:04 - Sam Roberts: I'm in, haven't seen any of them since the first one
25/03/2015, 16:04 - Sam Roberts: I hate to miss out on high culture!
25/03/2015, 16:36 - Alex Bunn: Sweeet
25/03/2015, 19:08 - Vanessa: I wish there was an emoticon that does eye roll
25/03/2015, 19:10 - Alex Bunn: üò±
25/03/2015, 19:57 - Mike Joyce: üé•=üöΩ?
25/03/2015, 19:59 - Mike Joyce: Actually I did not understand these films untill I was massively hung over...then they made pefect sence
25/03/2015, 20:00 - Shaggy: Woo my phone decided it can charge now
25/03/2015, 20:01 - Shaggy: Love the fat pics, bongo looks uncanny
26/03/2015, 08:51 - Shaggy: "Welcome back, Shaggy!"
26/03/2015, 08:51 - Shaggy: "Yay! he's back!"
26/03/2015, 08:51 - Shaggy: Aww so nice of you guys
26/03/2015, 08:57 - Tegan: I missed you Shaggy
26/03/2015, 09:29 - Joe Jarman: üéäüòâ
26/03/2015, 09:43 - Alex Bunn: Back to kill the convo flow
26/03/2015, 09:43 - Alex Bunn: üòâ
26/03/2015, 09:45 - Owen: I can't believe anyone is standing up for Clarkson. You don't get to punch a coworker over a cold steak just because you are famous for being a knob.
26/03/2015, 09:47 - Alex Bunn: I havnt heard anyone stand up for him
26/03/2015, 09:48 - Dave: I might stand up to piss on his car
26/03/2015, 09:48 - Dave: But i could do it sitting down
26/03/2015, 09:51 - Joe Jarman: Over one million people have signed his petition
26/03/2015, 09:52 - Joe Jarman: And his dinner was cold
26/03/2015, 09:52 - Joe Jarman: And the nobody producer was being an ass!!
26/03/2015, 10:10 - Shaggy: I like how James May put it - "much as I think he's a knob I quite like working with Jeremy"
26/03/2015, 10:12 - Sam Roberts: I can't believe you can be employed for being an entertaining prick for so long, then get suspended for being a prick
26/03/2015, 10:24 - Joe Jarman: It will ruin the show and itv will pick it up and it wil be really bad news for the bbc. One of the only shows left that anyone gives a fuck about overseas
26/03/2015, 10:34 - Owen: Doesn't mean you should be immune.
26/03/2015, 10:34 - Joe Jarman: But that's the reality
26/03/2015, 10:35 - Owen: The bbc still own the name. They will just find some new presenters.
26/03/2015, 10:35 - Joe Jarman: Top gear is nothing without Clarkson
26/03/2015, 10:36 - Owen: Jeremy Clarkson doesn't shit gold. He is just a balding middle aged white posh man with outdated opinions. It's not like Britain doesn't have loads of them lying about.
26/03/2015, 10:36 - Owen: You could get Nigel Farage to host the show and I wouldn't be able to tell the difference.
26/03/2015, 10:40 - Alex Bunn: Get rid
26/03/2015, 10:40 - Alex Bunn: He's a cunt
26/03/2015, 10:42 - Owen: Watch "Stewart Lee and Top Gear" on YouTube - Stewart Lee and Top Gear: https://youtu.be/K7CnMQ4L9Pc
26/03/2015, 10:42 - Joe Jarman: Well he has gone
26/03/2015, 10:42 - Shaggy: Top gear is dead
26/03/2015, 10:42 - Alex Bunn: They should replace top gear with a nice show about electric cars
26/03/2015, 10:42 - Joe Jarman: And top gear is dead
26/03/2015, 10:42 - Owen: I think stuart lee should take over
26/03/2015, 10:43 - Shaggy: Stuart lee is not funny
26/03/2015, 10:43 - Alex Bunn: Thats the point
26/03/2015, 10:44 - Joe Jarman: A show about electric cars mixed with a nice dose of political correctness
26/03/2015, 10:45 - Alex Bunn: Yep.
26/03/2015, 10:47 - Owen: Stuart lee is hilarious shaggy.
26/03/2015, 10:47 - Owen: Watch that video i just posted.
26/03/2015, 10:50 - Shaggy: Watched it yesterday. Not funny
26/03/2015, 10:50 - Alex Bunn: I dont see shaggy liking stewart lee
26/03/2015, 10:50 - Henry Dranks: I hate that video
26/03/2015, 10:50 - Alex Bunn: You have to be a miserable englishman to get him i think
26/03/2015, 10:50 - Owen: Do you think Jeremy Clarkson is funny then shags?
26/03/2015, 10:50 - Henry Dranks: And I agree that clarksons a cunt
26/03/2015, 10:51 - Henry Dranks: But that lee video is unfunny and ridiculously far off the mark about top gear
26/03/2015, 10:51 - Henry Dranks: And every one posts it everywhere like its some heavenly takedown of top gear
26/03/2015, 10:51 - Henry Dranks: Its fucking not!
26/03/2015, 10:51 - Alex Bunn: Is it the one about the playground bully?
26/03/2015, 10:52 - Owen: No its the one about wishing Hammond had died in that crash. But its only a joke, you know, like on top gear.
26/03/2015, 10:53 - Alex Bunn: Oh i get it
26/03/2015, 10:53 - Alex Bunn: I get jokes
26/03/2015, 10:53 - Shaggy: I think clarkson is funny, on the show. I don't think he is a nice person irl and his being fired is the correct thing to do, but it still ruins the show
26/03/2015, 10:53 - Alex Bunn: The show was a parody of itself by now
26/03/2015, 10:54 - Alex Bunn: I honestly couldnt tell if it was a new one or a rerun now
26/03/2015, 10:54 - Alex Bunn: The same shit again and again
26/03/2015, 10:56 - Angela: Alan partridge should be the new presenter
26/03/2015, 10:56 - Shaggy: It would be a different show entirely, but I c
26/03/2015, 10:56 - Shaggy: Condone this
26/03/2015, 10:58 - Owen: I just don't get why anyone finds an ignorant old man who should know better funny. His "jokes" literally consist of asian peoples eyes are slanted and post colonial Britain has a derogatory term for that; the term "slope." You know what else has slopes? Bridges do. Oh look a bridge with an Asian person on it. Wow! Slope on a slope! Hahahahahahahaha! Slope! Slopey slope slope slop! Hahahahaha, nudge nudge wink wink, were all thinking it aren't we middle Britain. Slope. Ha! 


Well no Jeremy, I'm not thinking that. All you have done is said "there is a person on a bridge" but somehow you have managed to do so in the most casually racist way possible.
26/03/2015, 10:58 - Alex Bunn: Yeah Alan Partridge!
26/03/2015, 10:59 - Alex Bunn: Its almost the same as clarkson but we can laugh at it
26/03/2015, 10:59 - Owen: Yeah because its a character. Not just a racist guy.
26/03/2015, 11:00 - Alex Bunn: Clarkson should have made an alter ego for the show and then he wouldnt be in half as much shit
26/03/2015, 11:00 - Owen: Totally.
26/03/2015, 11:00 - Shaggy: I think old racist people a funny because they are so clueless. In juxtaposition to him you had calm and collected may, and adorable hamster.
26/03/2015, 11:00 - Alex Bunn: That'd be using the ol noodle
26/03/2015, 11:01 - Owen: Problem is that Clarkson isn't clueless.
26/03/2015, 11:01 - Owen: A 90 yr old granma from rotherham is funny because she is clueless.
26/03/2015, 11:01 - Henry Dranks: Not clueless but he is a fossil
26/03/2015, 11:02 - Henry Dranks: My mums bf is like him
26/03/2015, 11:02 - Henry Dranks: Its not cluelessness they just dint understand modern views
26/03/2015, 11:02 - Henry Dranks: Or why its a problem
26/03/2015, 11:02 - Alex Bunn: They should get a 'toad of toad hall' charcter from wind in the willows to present
26/03/2015, 11:02 - Owen: Clarkson is 50 something, went to private school and probably has family money from colonialism knocking about.  His views don't come from cluelessness, his view
26/03/2015, 11:02 - Owen: Views come from a much more insidious place.
26/03/2015, 11:03 - Alex Bunn: Tim nice but dim. But with cars
26/03/2015, 11:03 - Alex Bunn: I'd watch that
26/03/2015, 11:03 - Alex Bunn: For a bit
26/03/2015, 11:03 - Alex Bunn: Boris! Haha
26/03/2015, 11:04 - Alex Bunn: Keeps him away from politics
26/03/2015, 11:04 - Owen: Steve coogan and rob brydon would be a good combo.
26/03/2015, 11:04 - Alex Bunn: Oooh yeah
26/03/2015, 11:04 - Owen: Also i think coogan is actually really into cars
26/03/2015, 11:05 - Alex Bunn: And brydon clearly isnt. It'd be hilarious
26/03/2015, 11:05 - Owen: Yeah. And they already have great chemistry. Have you seen the trip?
26/03/2015, 11:06 - Alex Bunn: Yeah of course. Thats why i'm so behind this idea
26/03/2015, 11:06 - Owen: Does there need to be a third?
26/03/2015, 11:06 - Eliza: And they'd spend half the time trying to do the best clarkson impression anyway!
26/03/2015, 11:06 - Owen: Hahahahha
26/03/2015, 11:06 - Angela: Hammond isn't a hamster he's a sheep. With his head far up clarksons arse
26/03/2015, 11:07 - Owen: Which would allow them to keep the casual racism that has made top gear so popular
26/03/2015, 11:11 - Alex Bunn: I thought it was about cars? Haha
26/03/2015, 11:11 - Alex Bunn: Ohohohohoho
26/03/2015, 11:13 - Owen: Nope. Otherwise fith gear would be popular
26/03/2015, 11:13 - Alex Bunn: Yeah or any other car show!
26/03/2015, 11:13 - Alex Bunn: How about cars and....
26/03/2015, 11:13 - Alex Bunn: Wait for it
26/03/2015, 11:14 - Alex Bunn: .... Guns
26/03/2015, 11:14 - Alex Bunn: I'm talking fast and furious 6
26/03/2015, 11:14 - Alex Bunn: With the rock
26/03/2015, 11:14 - Alex Bunn: Yes i watched it again last night
26/03/2015, 11:15 - Owen: Ok its settled. The new top gear cast is: steve coogan, rob brydon and dwayne "the rock" johnson
26/03/2015, 11:15 - Alex Bunn: We have a winner
26/03/2015, 11:16 - Henry Dranks: Haha good work bunn
26/03/2015, 11:17 - Henry Dranks: That film was instant classic
26/03/2015, 11:18 - Alex Bunn: Thanks üëç
26/03/2015, 11:18 - Alex Bunn: How was the sharknado trilogy?
26/03/2015, 11:19 - Henry Dranks: I didnt get onto it my internet died :(
26/03/2015, 11:20 - Alex Bunn: How terrible!
26/03/2015, 11:20 - Henry Dranks: Truly it was the darkest of times
26/03/2015, 11:22 - Alex Bunn: Are you still ill?
26/03/2015, 11:22 - Alex Bunn: Or have you managed to go to work?
26/03/2015, 11:22 - Alex Bunn: Where, conveniently, the internet works
26/03/2015, 11:26 - Henry Dranks: Haha
26/03/2015, 11:27 - Henry Dranks: Better now cheers
26/03/2015, 11:27 - Alex Bunn: HA!
26/03/2015, 11:27 - Alex Bunn: Busted
26/03/2015, 11:27 - Henry Dranks: Btw lil adam is down sat and were gonna meet up with stanford anyone in?
26/03/2015, 11:28 - Alex Bunn: Oh god. I can tell you the rio stories
26/03/2015, 11:28 - Alex Bunn: And tom can tell us how he ended up in thai prison for a week
26/03/2015, 11:28 - Henry Dranks: Yes!
26/03/2015, 11:28 - Henry Dranks: All things I want to hear
26/03/2015, 11:33 - Owen: <Media omitted>
26/03/2015, 11:33 - Owen: Worst mark scheme ever!
26/03/2015, 11:33 - Owen: They might as well write "pupil has put the correct answer down"
26/03/2015, 11:35 - Henry Dranks: #teacherproblems
26/03/2015, 11:36 - Owen: This is a proper exam. It affects these pupil's GCSE results. And they give me this vague bullshit markscheme. #fuckAQA
26/03/2015, 11:36 - Henry Dranks: What was the question?
26/03/2015, 11:36 - Alex Bunn: Be a nice teacher and give them all their GCES
26/03/2015, 11:37 - Owen: It gets moderated. Otherwise i would, the mark scheme is vague enough that it wouldn't even feel unprofessional to do so.
26/03/2015, 11:38 - Owen: @henry: the question was "why might someone else not get the same results as you"
26/03/2015, 11:39 - Henry Dranks: Doesnt sound like a particularly well set question
26/03/2015, 11:45 - Owen: It's a crock of shit, the whole paper is!
26/03/2015, 11:46 - Alex Bunn: OWEN RAMPAGE
26/03/2015, 11:49 - Owen: The paper doesn't test the kids. It tests the teacher's understanding of game theory . So much is left up to my discretion, but thats the same accross the country. So I have to mark bearing in mind that other teachers across the country will probably be lenient because they can be and because they are probably basing their marking on the idea that other teachers will be lenient. But I have to balance that with the fact that the papers get moderated. It's a fucking nightmare, just give me a mark scheme that says: "this is right, this is wrong"
26/03/2015, 11:51 - Dave: Mark it zero dude
26/03/2015, 11:52 - Alex Bunn: Lol
26/03/2015, 12:16 - Mike SJ: '156 messages from 2 conversations'
26/03/2015, 12:16 - Mike SJ: I thought you guys had jobs
26/03/2015, 12:17 - Henry Dranks: Http://www.landoverbaptist.net/showthread.php?t=4474
26/03/2015, 12:18 - Henry Dranks: I cant get my head around someone believing what hes written
26/03/2015, 12:19 - Henry Dranks: Is it a parody?
26/03/2015, 12:59 - Shaggy: Teachers aren't what they used to be, they want answers given on a plate to them these days
26/03/2015, 13:01 - Owen: On marks schemes. Yes
26/03/2015, 18:40 - Owen: Henry:

"The Bible clearly states that the sky is a solid dome, a "firmament," which was firm enough to separate waters above it from those below on the Earth. By Noah's time it was still solid enough to have windows in it that had to be opened to let the rain through. I think that false-Christians that spite on God's face by calling it "poetic metaphor" have given in to the godless materialists! The Bible really is literal, in the true sense of the word. The sky was a hard firmament with windows in it-and anybody who says different is a mealy-mouthed evolution-sympathizer. "

Almost certainly a  parody.
26/03/2015, 18:40 - Owen: Also:

"Evolutionists want to call those piddlin' changes "evolution"--which just shows that they don't even know what the term means. So we creationists have to tell them that "evolution" means apes popping out human babies. You'd think them evil-utionists'd have that straight by now."
26/03/2015, 18:40 - Henry Dranks: But...read the replies
26/03/2015, 18:40 - Owen: A parody. But a hilarious one.
26/03/2015, 18:40 - Henry Dranks: Its a very well done parody
26/03/2015, 18:40 - Owen: Oooo. There's replies. I haven't get there yet
26/03/2015, 18:41 - Henry Dranks: I thought it was a parody
26/03/2015, 18:41 - Henry Dranks: Then I read the replies
26/03/2015, 18:41 - Henry Dranks: And now I think it might be real
26/03/2015, 18:41 - Henry Dranks: I just dont know what to believe anymore :(
26/03/2015, 18:41 - Shaggy: Can you believe it's not butter?
26/03/2015, 18:42 - Henry Dranks: I...I just dont know
26/03/2015, 18:43 - Mike Joyce: Can you belive its not god butter?
26/03/2015, 18:43 - Henry Dranks: What would god butter even entail?
26/03/2015, 18:43 - Shaggy: Gutter

26/03/2015, 18:45 - Mike Joyce: We all contain gods butter
26/03/2015, 18:45 - Mike Joyce: I always fins it most amusing that thses bloggers are using a computer
26/03/2015, 18:47 - Mike Joyce: The same disaplin of logical deduction goes into the design of a computer is simply applied to fossel records
26/03/2015, 18:47 - Shaggy: Yes. At least Amish keep it real
26/03/2015, 18:47 - Mike Joyce: Respect the aimish
26/03/2015, 18:47 - Mike Joyce: But then its like...now your pretending the modern world dosnt exist
26/03/2015, 18:48 - Mike Joyce: So actually even more retarded
26/03/2015, 18:48 - Mike Joyce: But then i guse my laptop is one of satens tricks
26/03/2015, 18:49 - Mike Joyce: Steve jobs and bill gates are both demonic incarnations
26/03/2015, 18:49 - Mike Joyce: Bill gates with his philantropy...dont belive it!!
26/03/2015, 18:49 - Owen: I am pretty sure it is just loads of trolls trolling each other.
26/03/2015, 18:50 - Mike Joyce: im talking in general terms
26/03/2015, 18:51 - Shaggy: Speaking of trolls, here's an interesting article http://www.rferl.mobi/a/how-to-guide-russian-trolling-trolls/26919999.html
26/03/2015, 18:53 - Mike Joyce: Holly shit
26/03/2015, 18:53 - Mike Joyce: Unsuprised but saddened
26/03/2015, 18:56 - Owen: Wow. I wonder if that happens at all in britain or America
26/03/2015, 18:57 - Mike Joyce: Probably. ..Certainly the latter
26/03/2015, 18:57 - Mike Joyce: I bet private companies
26/03/2015, 18:58 - Shaggy: I was wondering the same, but I think it's less likely to happen politically, at least in such a way
26/03/2015, 18:58 - Shaggy: I mean Fox News is pretty much that, but it's more official
26/03/2015, 19:00 - Mike Joyce: Yes i guess russia only really has one party of strength
26/03/2015, 19:01 - Mike Joyce: It would be like fox news if all democrats were gone
26/03/2015, 19:02 - Owen: Whelp, looks like I'm having nightmares tonight.
26/03/2015, 19:14 - Mike SJ: Tl;dr for today's Horde chat?

02/04/2015, 19:54 - Sam Roberts: They both don't make a lot of sense until you realise that holding a beer doesn't get in the way of either
02/04/2015, 19:54 - Sam Roberts: Can't wait
02/04/2015, 19:55 - Shaggy: Cricket is a lot more boring

02/04/2015, 21:34 - Sam Roberts: I'm saying it, televised debates are bad for democracy

02/04/2015, 21:39 - Dave: Lol
02/04/2015, 21:42 - Hannah Murphy: Also when the camera pans back to the girl who asked the question, check out the moustache on the guy two seats to the left
02/04/2015, 21:43 - Dave: It's amazing
02/04/2015, 21:43 - Dave: Hope he has a question
02/04/2015, 22:14 - Hannah Murphy: <Media omitted>
02/04/2015, 22:14 - Shaggy: Wow that's impressive
02/04/2015, 23:23 - Owen: I wish fact checking happened in real time.
02/04/2015, 23:23 - Owen: That would change everything
02/04/2015, 23:24 - Dave: Yeah, and there was a claxon every time someone was inaccurate
02/04/2015, 23:24 - Dave: It would just be a constant alarm for 2 hours
02/04/2015, 23:24 - Joe Jarman: <Media omitted>
02/04/2015, 23:24 - Owen: And a dong everytime someone made a promise they couldn't keep.

02/04/2015, 23:31 - Dave: Milliband's performance has made me wonder abour voting labour.
02/04/2015, 23:31 - Dave: He couldn't stand up to the real points about past labour
02/04/2015, 23:32 - Dave: As in, PFI in the NHS, not the whole labour recked the economy crap
02/04/2015, 23:33 - Dave: The nationalists (not inc UKIP) had the strongest message for me but it's useless for an English voter
02/04/2015, 23:33 - Dave: Doh
02/04/2015, 23:36 - Dave: There endeth the bantz

03/04/2015, 16:16 - Tegan: No sign of luggage?

03/04/2015, 17:28 - Vanessa: Where are you at the mo?
03/04/2015, 17:28 - Owen: OMG. You need to hurry up.

03/04/2015, 17:40 - Vanessa: Cool
03/04/2015, 17:40 - Vanessa: It's all ready to hit play
03/04/2015, 17:45 - Tegan: Whoop!
03/04/2015, 18:53 - Bongo: I've just been getting into Stewart lee
03/04/2015, 18:53 - Bongo: That guy is funny
03/04/2015, 19:11 - Shaggy: That means you're getting old
03/04/2015, 19:19 - Owen: No. It means he has a sense of humour that doesn't revolve around farting in a cockney accent.
03/04/2015, 19:29 - Bongo: He has this ridiculously long but about ukip that's hilarious
03/04/2015, 19:30 - Tegan: He is great at ridiculously long bits
03/04/2015, 19:30 - Tegan: Shaggy doesn't get it for some reason
03/04/2015, 19:43 - Owen: Coz shaggy only understands the humour of long russian winters; not long british rants.
03/04/2015, 19:43 - Alex Bunn: Yeah i think thats it
03/04/2015, 19:45 - Mike SJ: He does less protracted rants now to be fair
03/04/2015, 19:45 - Mike SJ: I was never really that into them
03/04/2015, 19:53 - Owen: I love him. He is the kind of funny i wish i could be. Silly and dry at the same time is so hard to pull of.
03/04/2015, 19:53 - Owen: Off*
03/04/2015, 19:54 - Tegan: Theatre, innit
03/04/2015, 19:54 - Owen: Down by the corn exchange.
03/04/2015, 19:54 - Tegan: Right
03/04/2015, 20:06 - Mike SJ: I like him a lot, but I've always thought his repetition comedy was weak
03/04/2015, 20:07 - Mike SJ: Like the one where he's talking about the taxi driver who says you'll get locked in prison for saying you're english
03/04/2015, 20:07 - Mike SJ: It doesn't make me laugh
03/04/2015, 20:07 - Tegan: It goes through being weak into being funny again
03/04/2015, 20:08 - Tegan: That's the joy
03/04/2015, 20:08 - Mike SJ: But it's kind of cheap, you know?
03/04/2015, 20:09 - Tegan: After reading that book I feel like he's just messing with people
03/04/2015, 20:10 - Tegan: I can understand why you wouldn't enjoy it
03/04/2015, 20:10 - Alex Bunn: Shouldnt you be drunk mike?
03/04/2015, 20:11 - Alex Bunn: Get back to drinking! üçª
03/04/2015, 20:48 - Mike SJ: <Media omitted>
03/04/2015, 21:26 - Bongo: Good Viking look shags
03/04/2015, 21:50 - Vanessa: What's the singers name in Nickelback?
03/04/2015, 21:53 - Shaggy: Bongo
03/04/2015, 23:15 - Joe Jarman: Chad Kroeger
03/04/2015, 23:15 - Joe Jarman: Or something
03/04/2015, 23:17 - Mike SJ: Adolf Hitler I think
04/04/2015, 09:31 - Shaggy: My problem with Stewart lee is that his humour is just really drawn out. He says something remotely funny and then clings to it for half an hour, I find it tedious. He is the exact opposite of Mitch hedberg, who was all about punchlines. He is just a really clever guy who slightly misinterpreted humour and made a career out of it. Or is making fun out of humour.
04/04/2015, 09:37 - Tegan: Makes me chuckle.  Mitch Hedberg is all about words, but Stewart Lee does a lot more than that - he uses patterns and devices a lot more.
04/04/2015, 09:37 - Tegan: I think it's much more interesting than what a lot of comedians do
04/04/2015, 09:38 - Shaggy: I can see why people find him funny, I think he would be excellent beer comrade, I'm just not into his monologues
04/04/2015, 09:40 - Alex Bunn: I have grown into it
04/04/2015, 09:41 - Shaggy: And I got used to living with mould in my room.
04/04/2015, 10:15 - Bongo: Dogs are always in the push-up position
04/04/2015, 10:16 - Bongo: Classic
04/04/2015, 10:17 - Bongo: Agree with tegs though Stewart lee is specifically coming from a different angle
04/04/2015, 12:37 - Mike SJ: Shaggy check out Dan Mintz on youtube
04/04/2015, 12:37 - Mike SJ: He voices Tina on Bob's Burgers, quite Mitch Hedburgish
04/04/2015, 12:38 - Mike SJ: Partly it's just funny seeing that voice come out of that face
04/04/2015, 13:03 - Alex Bunn: Whatup gang. Meeting craig and hayley and otherss for drinks in angel later
04/04/2015, 13:03 - Alex Bunn: Consider initation extended
04/04/2015, 13:03 - Alex Bunn: Invitation*

04/04/2015, 13:07 - Tegan: Sounds good
04/04/2015, 13:07 - Tegan: Important but unrelated question:
04/04/2015, 13:08 - Tegan: Labour are going to introduce an internet porn regulator
04/04/2015, 13:08 - Tegan: What should they call it?
04/04/2015, 13:09 - Bongo: Pornotron
04/04/2015, 13:10 - Shaggy: PornHAL
04/04/2015, 13:12 - Bongo: It'll be run by ed balls right?
04/04/2015, 13:12 - Bongo: Balls deep
04/04/2015, 13:30 - Tegan: I was going down the COM root
04/04/2015, 13:30 - Tegan: Jerk-off-com?
04/04/2015, 13:33 - Bongo: Cockblockdotcom
04/04/2015, 13:35 - Alex Bunn: Pornop
04/04/2015, 13:35 - Alex Bunn: Pornope*
04/04/2015, 13:44 - Mike SJ: Spank bank of England
04/04/2015, 13:45 - Bongo: Ministry of chastity belts

04/04/2015, 13:58 - Owen: Just thought i would add my sub par one to the mix
04/04/2015, 14:02 - Tegan: Thanks all- some good thoughts
04/04/2015, 14:03 - Shaggy: I can't believe there aren't better things to work on
04/04/2015, 14:04 - Owen: But a kid might see a woman urinate shaggy. Think of the children. Is no one thinking of the children
04/04/2015, 14:04 - Shaggy: This country is teeming with immigrants and they want to deny us basic human rights
04/04/2015, 14:05 - Owen: I think shaggy might be voting UKIP guys...
04/04/2015, 14:05 - Bongo: Yea they looking at it all wrong, they need to integrate education into it
04/04/2015, 14:05 - Owen: Shotgun teaching that lesson!
04/04/2015, 14:06 - Bongo: If 3 swingers and 4 couples go to an orgy, how many people were having sex?
04/04/2015, 14:06 - Owen: I'm perfect for the job. Not only have i had 5 years teaching experience, I also have an encyclopedic knowledge of porn.
04/04/2015, 14:06 - Owen: 11!
04/04/2015, 14:06 - Owen: Boom see!
04/04/2015, 14:07 - Owen: Perfect for the job.
04/04/2015, 14:07 - Shaggy: For the blow job
04/04/2015, 14:07 - Bongo: Ahh but I didn't say how many people just wanted to go to watch
04/04/2015, 14:07 - Bongo: Or how many animals there were
04/04/2015, 14:09 - Owen: It's a swingers party not a United kingdom independence party.
04/04/2015, 14:10 - Shaggy: Are they british animals?
04/04/2015, 15:09 - Jimena: And does sex with oneself count?
04/04/2015, 15:10 - Jimena: If so, at which point does it count as sex? What are the requirements?
04/04/2015, 15:11 - Jimena: In fact what are the running sex criteria? A teacher must anticipate such questions
04/04/2015, 15:20 - Jimena: <Media omitted>
04/04/2015, 15:20 - Jimena: Frankenplughole
04/04/2015, 15:29 - Mike SJ: That sounds like a gross sex position
04/04/2015, 15:55 - Alex Bunn: Anybody got any suggestions for a decent bar in angel that wont be filled with the usual saturday night hideousness?
04/04/2015, 15:56 - Shaggy: The brewery is really nice, what used to be the arc
04/04/2015, 15:57 - Alex Bunn: Oh yeah i havent been there yet

05/04/2015, 11:49 - Alex Bunn: We can host a movie marathon
05/04/2015, 11:49 - Alex Bunn: I'm back to being broke after a couple drinks last night
05/04/2015, 12:09 - Tegan: There should be a free music festival in Victoria Park today
05/04/2015, 12:09 - Tegan: There isn't though
05/04/2015, 12:10 - Tegan: So I'm out of ideas
05/04/2015, 12:11 - Alex Bunn: Lol
05/04/2015, 12:14 - Tegan: Think we're going to wander round greenwich Park
05/04/2015, 12:14 - Tegan: I'm going to eat too much chocolate

05/04/2015, 12:18 - Bongo: Shags your pc is massively freaking me out
05/04/2015, 12:18 - Bongo: It's doing this weird word replace

06/04/2015, 13:45 - Bongo: Now the guys thinks I'm an idiot and won't stop trying to explain what a hard disk is
06/04/2015, 13:46 - Bongo: Fml
06/04/2015, 13:50 - Hannah Murphy: Bahahahah
06/04/2015, 14:04 - Joe Jarman: Lol
06/04/2015, 14:17 - Owen: Just watched the debates. Right. Thats it. I'm voting UKIP. Can't have these foreign homos coming over here with all their super AIDS! Spreading all their super AIDS on all the surfaces. Foreign homos, with thier super AIDS get 'em out. Send 'em back to homoland with their super AIDS  let them rot in homoland! If they have the audacity to be born in a country without a good healthcare system and an AIDS epidemic let them homo rot in their homo super AIDS. The frogman has spoken.

08/04/2015, 10:07 - Jimena: Or a robe? And by robe i really mean dress.
08/04/2015, 10:09 - Dave: I think you got in the first time. It's a onesie loving house
08/04/2015, 10:10 - Mike SJ: He's probably wearing it as we speak
08/04/2015, 10:22 - Sam Roberts: You caught my bad side

08/04/2015, 10:48 - Pete Morey: Plus bacon,  black.
08/04/2015, 14:07 - Jimena: Lol. I didnt know onesies were back. Although i know they are very popular in australia
08/04/2015, 14:11 - Jimena: <Media omitted>
08/04/2015, 14:11 - Jimena: Good friend of mine went through a onesie modelling phase
08/04/2015, 14:12 - Shaggy: Australia's climate is not great for onesies
08/04/2015, 14:12 - Jimena: <Media omitted>
08/04/2015, 14:13 - Jimena: Maybe they are in a different material..
08/04/2015, 14:15 - Jimena: http://www.onesiestore.com.au/shop/animal-onesies
08/04/2015, 14:22 - Shaggy: Nah they is the same what we have http://www.kigu.co.uk
08/04/2015, 14:25 - Krizia: I really don't get the popularity of kigus!! Why would you want to dress up as a fat and big animal?
08/04/2015, 14:25 - Krizia: Specially in Australia!  Whyyyyy would you use one in the beach! !!üò©
08/04/2015, 14:26 - Krizia: Whyyyyy! !!!
08/04/2015, 14:26 - Krizia: :p
08/04/2015, 14:46 - Shaggy: Fat is the new black
08/04/2015, 14:46 - Shaggy: And animals were always sexy
08/04/2015, 14:48 - Krizia: Mmmmmmm no
08/04/2015, 14:53 - Vanessa: I agree with Krizia
08/04/2015, 14:55 - Shaggy: <Media omitted>
08/04/2015, 15:04 - Jimena: Are you ladies not familiar with 'fat pants'?
08/04/2015, 15:05 - Jimena: I.e. Stretchy loose clothes you can comfortably binge in?
08/04/2015, 15:07 - Jimena: Two: a onesie is much like a blankie that hugs all your body at once.
08/04/2015, 15:11 - Sam Roberts: Great points Jimena
08/04/2015, 15:11 - Sam Roberts: it's also impossible to be unhappy in a onesie
08/04/2015, 15:20 - Tegan: I think that is probably true
08/04/2015, 15:20 - Tegan: I am remembering how happy Shaggy was as the marshmallow dude from ghostbusters
08/04/2015, 15:23 - Mike SJ: <Media omitted>
08/04/2015, 15:24 - Shaggy: Cananabananalism

08/04/2015, 16:53 - Krizia: Better to be gigant fruits
08/04/2015, 16:53 - Krizia: Jhjajajajjajaja
08/04/2015, 17:01 - Krizia: Than animals
08/04/2015, 17:01 - Krizia: Ajjajaj
08/04/2015, 17:27 - Shaggy: Like a giant butternut squash
08/04/2015, 17:27 - Shaggy: Or a cashew
09/04/2015, 00:00 - Jimena: <Media omitted>
09/04/2015, 08:30 - Shaggy: They're not wrong
09/04/2015, 08:32 - Tegan: no, they are wrong
09/04/2015, 08:33 - Tegan: It's more like the answer to 'what ended at the onset of 1896?'
09/04/2015, 08:38 - Hannah Murphy: Harsh Tegan, harsh
09/04/2015, 08:59 - Shaggy: Pedant
09/04/2015, 09:02 - Mike SJ: Lol I was gona say that too Tegan, but didn't want to be the smartass
09/04/2015, 09:03 - Dave: Half marks
09/04/2015, 09:03 - Shaggy: Sounds like you have the grumps again. Get some coffee
09/04/2015, 09:05 - Sam Roberts: Shaggy calling Tegan a pedant? What is this, opposite day?
09/04/2015, 09:05 - Mike SJ: To be fair, that kid was trying to be a smartass, gotta get it right
09/04/2015, 09:05 - Mike SJ: Like Muphries law
09/04/2015, 09:05 - Shaggy: Muffries
09/04/2015, 09:10 - Henry Dranks: Surely it can end in 1896 because it doesnt end simultaneously around the world
09/04/2015, 09:10 - Henry Dranks: Some bits of the world are un 1896 while others still in 1895
09/04/2015, 09:22 - Tegan: I'm with Mike
09/04/2015, 09:22 - Mike SJ: True, but you can't say we're 'in' Wednesday because it is in Hawaii
09/04/2015, 09:23 - Mike SJ: Its mutually exclusive for each time zone
09/04/2015, 09:24 - Mike SJ: I can see this being one of those "oh my god, 136 messages from the Horde, wtf" arguments, so I'm going to take a step back now
09/04/2015, 10:01 - Henry Dranks: Haha wheres the fun in that
09/04/2015, 10:10 - Alex Bunn: Boring!
09/04/2015, 10:17 - Krizia: <Media omitted>
09/04/2015, 10:17 - Krizia: Hawaiii
09/04/2015, 10:17 - Krizia: Sorry guys that's the only thing I got from the conversation
09/04/2015, 10:17 - Krizia: :)
09/04/2015, 11:22 - Jimena: I personally think that any valid answer should be accepted as its the person writing the exams job to word thinks clearly. Teacher might also want to give a lesson on deducing what kind of answer is expected given a context.
09/04/2015, 11:24 - Jimena: Finally i agree w tegan and mike that as the answer given was actually not valid that should be pointed out to the kid. Whether kid wants to be a smartass or not he should make sure his answer is valid.
09/04/2015, 11:26 - Jimena: I have been humbled a few times by little kids outsmarting me. For example one time kids were really noisy and i yelled and asked if they could hear me. A little 4 year old said to me:
09/04/2015, 11:26 - Jimena: Of course i can hear you. I have ears.
09/04/2015, 11:27 - Jimena: So i never asked things in that way again.
09/04/2015, 11:30 - Jimena: Another time i told kids off for telling each other off. I said 'I'M the police'. And a 6 or 7 year old said 'no, the POLICE is the police.' So i had to rephrase things differently
09/04/2015, 11:31 - Jimena: Btw the example before came from an Indian friend
09/04/2015, 11:31 - Jimena: (The one in the photo)
09/04/2015, 11:32 - Vanessa: Not everyone with ears can hear
09/04/2015, 11:32 - Vanessa: That's what I would have told the kid
09/04/2015, 11:32 - Jimena: Lol. She was 4. But touch√©.
09/04/2015, 11:33 - Jimena: <Media omitted>
09/04/2015, 11:33 - Shaggy: Lol
09/04/2015, 11:34 - Shaggy: Freddie, johny, ...
09/04/2015, 11:34 - Tegan: Now that's some quality wisecracking
09/04/2015, 11:38 - Mike SJ: <Media omitted>
09/04/2015, 12:25 - Sam Roberts: I'm just signing up to do a mud run with a chap from work anyone fancy it?

09/04/2015, 12:26 - Alex Bunn: I bet its one of those tough mudder things!
09/04/2015, 12:27 - Alex Bunn: I'm keen depending in dates
09/04/2015, 12:27 - Sam Roberts: No electrocution though!
09/04/2015, 12:28 - Sam Roberts: http://www.back2thetrenches.co.uk/events.php#.VQKwc0Jcfds
09/04/2015, 12:29 - Sam Roberts: I'm signing up for the June run just now
09/04/2015, 12:33 - Vanessa: I'd be in but can't do June, perhaps the Sept one
09/04/2015, 12:55 - Bongo: How much is it?
09/04/2015, 12:55 - Bongo: I love the sound of everything except the jogging
09/04/2015, 12:56 - Bongo: If there's a shop mobility lane inbetween obstacles I'm in
09/04/2015, 13:01 - Joe Jarman: <Media omitted>
09/04/2015, 13:02 - Bongo: Sigkt?
09/04/2015, 13:02 - Tegan: First, master the use of basic grammar
09/04/2015, 13:03 - Tegan: Then discuss human rights
09/04/2015, 13:03 - Tegan: 's Maslow, innit
09/04/2015, 13:07 - Joe Jarman: Fight!
09/04/2015, 13:48 - Alex Bunn: Harry has some beef
09/04/2015, 14:07 - Owen: I am not sure anyone has the right to fight anyone else. Harry seems to think girls have fighting rights, i am pretty sure they don't; unless there is some blasted EU regulation, get Britain out so boys can punch girls again.
09/04/2015, 14:20 - Tegan: agreed
09/04/2015, 14:20 - Tegan: no
09/04/2015, 14:20 - Tegan: wait..
09/04/2015, 15:15 - Mike SJ: Do you have the right to fight for your right to party?
09/04/2015, 15:50 - Bongo: Let's just agree to party
09/04/2015, 17:13 - Vanessa: Is someone going to be in ctown around 6:30pmish?

09/04/2015, 18:09 - Joe Jarman: Yeah I could go for a beer
09/04/2015, 18:09 - Joe Jarman: I'm in the wharf atm. Just about to leave
09/04/2015, 18:10 - Shaggy: Hmm I guess cat and canary has a nice outside bit
09/04/2015, 18:10 - Joe Jarman: Are you far?
09/04/2015, 18:10 - Shaggy: At work
09/04/2015, 18:11 - Joe Jarman: You wanna come here then?
09/04/2015, 18:11 - Shaggy: I haven't quite finish, I could aim for 7
09/04/2015, 18:18 - Joe Jarman: I wonder if Dave is here
09/04/2015, 18:22 - Joe Jarman: I could come towards you mate tbh
09/04/2015, 18:22 - Joe Jarman: I could do with getting out of east London

09/04/2015, 19:10 - Mateusz: Boom
09/04/2015, 19:16 - Lorna: Faltering fullback?...
10/04/2015, 14:38 - Bongo: Anyone know a good organiser app
10/04/2015, 14:38 - Bongo: Like outlook does with meetings
10/04/2015, 14:39 - Tegan: Google?
10/04/2015, 14:41 - Bongo: Yea cool
10/04/2015, 14:41 - Bongo: I should always answer questions with "Google" it's almost always the right answer
10/04/2015, 14:41 - Bongo: Cheers tegs!
10/04/2015, 14:42 - Tegan: I don't think Google calendars is as good as outlook somehow
10/04/2015, 14:43 - Tegan: Maybe it's because I don't check my Google account as often
10/04/2015, 14:43 - Tegan: Are you coming out tonight, Bongo?
10/04/2015, 14:47 - Bongo: Nah going down to redhill to see a mate about a job

11/04/2015, 12:41 - Tegan: How's Jules getting on?
11/04/2015, 12:48 - Sam Roberts: Yeah good, still on the mocktail sales trail
11/04/2015, 12:48 - Sam Roberts: He's gone from running a stall to distribution though
11/04/2015, 12:48 - Sam Roberts: Sounds hella hard work at the mo, could grow pretty quickly with a bit of luck though
11/04/2015, 12:48 - Tegan: I have no idea what that means :)
11/04/2015, 13:01 - Sam Roberts: Ah he has this little company selling alcohol free cocktails
11/04/2015, 13:01 - Sam Roberts: Or mocktails, for the cool kids

11/04/2015, 15:10 - Mike SJ: Cycling lol
11/04/2015, 15:11 - Shaggy: It gives +10 to cycling but -100 to balance
11/04/2015, 15:14 - Sam Roberts: 3 beers gives you the best cycling skills
11/04/2015, 15:17 - Shaggy: But also remove any ability to resist drinking more beers
11/04/2015, 15:18 - Mike SJ: I agree, I think 3 beers Mike is better than me at a lot of things
11/04/2015, 15:18 - Mike SJ: At least 3 beers Mike thinks that
11/04/2015, 15:36 - Sam Roberts: 3 beers Mike is a real swell guy

11/04/2015, 15:51 - Vanessa: Shaggy can show you
11/04/2015, 15:55 - Sam Roberts: <Media omitted>
11/04/2015, 15:57 - Vanessa: That's a nice pub
11/04/2015, 15:57 - Vanessa: It's near an old disused train station
11/04/2015, 16:08 - Tegan: sun = great
11/04/2015, 16:10 - Sam Roberts: <Media omitted>
11/04/2015, 16:40 - Hannah Murphy: Ru Paul!!!
11/04/2015, 17:53 - Shaggy: <Media omitted>
11/04/2015, 20:14 - Mateusz: What's happening people?
11/04/2015, 22:11 - Shaggy: Ah sorry dude just saw
11/04/2015, 22:12 - Shaggy: Just got out at e&c. What you up to?
12/04/2015, 10:19 - Sam Roberts: <Media omitted>
12/04/2015, 10:24 - Vinay: Just heard that news...
12/04/2015, 10:24 - Vinay: Not going d/l them to watch them all at once, though...
12/04/2015, 10:29 - Sam Roberts: It's going to be a rough 3 weeks...
12/04/2015, 10:33 - Shaggy: What...do we still do it every Monday or do we have a week of BBQ?
12/04/2015, 10:53 - Tegan: mondays!
12/04/2015, 10:53 - Tegan: Damn that full
12/04/2015, 10:53 - Tegan: fool
12/04/2015, 10:53 - Tegan: Just as mondays were about to have meaning again
12/04/2015, 10:56 - Dave: This is sad news. Mondays are an event woth GoT. If we just download it all then it will all be spent in a few days and forgotten rather than being a joy of spring and summer. I think we should all agree to only download one a week.
12/04/2015, 10:59 - Shaggy: I'm in. Very convincing argument
12/04/2015, 11:00 - Sam Roberts: Well spoken Dave! I'm in
12/04/2015, 11:01 - Sam Roberts: Just gotta go delete the imgur and reddit apps...
12/04/2015, 11:01 - Mike SJ: I reckon Joe is watching them as we speak lol
12/04/2015, 11:02 - Alex Bunn: If you watch all 4 then you have to wait a month for the 5th!!!
12/04/2015, 11:03 - Bongo: For the love of god, why would they do this to us?!
12/04/2015, 11:04 - Alex Bunn: Damn those hackers
12/04/2015, 11:09 - Dave: Glad it's only a few. I also wager joe is all over this!
12/04/2015, 11:10 - Alex Bunn: Looks like we'll have to silence him
12/04/2015, 11:11 - Mike SJ: I read that HBO send out screeners for TV reviewers
12/04/2015, 11:11 - Mike SJ: If that's true, it's completely retarded
12/04/2015, 11:12 - Mike SJ: Also, quality is only 480p, not good enough!
12/04/2015, 11:31 - Tegan: bah
12/04/2015, 11:31 - Tegan: I shit 480p
12/04/2015, 11:31 - Tegan: (I don't know what that means :))
12/04/2015, 11:38 - Mike SJ: 480p means not HD basically
12/04/2015, 11:39 - Owen: <Media omitted>
12/04/2015, 11:39 - Dan Sluckin: Hahaha
12/04/2015, 11:39 - Dan Sluckin: Keep it!
12/04/2015, 11:40 - Eliza: Shut up Dan! He will listen to you.
12/04/2015, 11:40 - Lorna: Is quite convenient it ran out of battery just as you shaved a moustache
12/04/2015, 11:41 - Eliza: No, not convenient. That is the opposite of convenient.
12/04/2015, 11:43 - Owen: The reason my head is turned like that is to hide the extra long side burn
12/04/2015, 11:46 - Mike SJ: Kill it with fire
12/04/2015, 11:50 - Bongo: Hahaha
12/04/2015, 11:52 - Bongo: <Media omitted>
12/04/2015, 12:02 - Joe Jarman: <Media omitted>
12/04/2015, 12:05 - Bongo: None of that joe
12/04/2015, 12:06 - Joe Jarman: Watch the full episode now on.... Whatsapp!
12/04/2015, 12:06 - Joe Jarman: 20 3 minute chunks
12/04/2015, 12:06 - Joe Jarman: For maximum enjoyment
12/04/2015, 12:08 - Owen: 20 3second chunks that are the biggest spoilers.
12/04/2015, 12:10 - Joe Jarman: Nah that's just the intro
12/04/2015, 12:12 - Owen: Wow I just watched it. Who would have thought that snape is really the ghost of arya.
12/04/2015, 12:14 - Shaggy: Snape, snape, Severus snape
12/04/2015, 19:41 - Vanessa: Does anybody have marketing experience/specialisation?
12/04/2015, 19:47 - Bongo: In what context?
12/04/2015, 19:48 - Vanessa: Events
12/04/2015, 19:48 - Bongo: We have a mate who used to do it for a living
12/04/2015, 19:48 - Bongo: Sam saw him yesterday!
12/04/2015, 19:49 - Vanessa: I'm doing an event to get people to sign up to a service. I'm wondering when is the best time after the event to send a message to get them to sign up
12/04/2015, 19:49 - Vanessa: The mocktail guy?
12/04/2015, 19:49 - Bongo: Yea!
12/04/2015, 19:51 - Bongo: With my extremely limited knowledge of marketing is say anywhere between 2 days and a week
12/04/2015, 19:51 - Vanessa: Lol
12/04/2015, 19:51 - Vanessa: I need them to sign up ASAP
12/04/2015, 19:53 - Bongo: Should've done it at the event then
12/04/2015, 19:53 - Vanessa: It hasn't happened
12/04/2015, 19:53 - Vanessa: Yet
12/04/2015, 19:53 - Vanessa: So I basically need them to sign up soon after they leave the event
12/04/2015, 19:54 - Bongo: Ahh
12/04/2015, 19:54 - Bongo: Can't you try to get them to do it at the event?
12/04/2015, 19:54 - Vanessa: It's online booking so I could but most will be occupied with their kids
12/04/2015, 19:56 - Bongo: Does it involve money?
12/04/2015, 19:56 - Vanessa: The booking yes, they are paying for a service
12/04/2015, 19:56 - Vanessa: The event is free
12/04/2015, 19:57 - Bongo: Send them an email straight after then
12/04/2015, 19:57 - Bongo: As just a thanks for coming email
12/04/2015, 19:57 - Vanessa: Yeah that's what I was thinking but I didn't know exactly how long to wait
12/04/2015, 19:57 - Bongo: But with a subtle "give me all your money" at the end
12/04/2015, 19:57 - Vanessa: I've already written the text to send them
12/04/2015, 19:58 - Vanessa: üí∞üí∞üí∞üí∞
12/04/2015, 19:58 - Bongo: Straight after the event
12/04/2015, 19:58 - Vanessa: Ok cool
12/04/2015, 19:58 - Bongo: My 2-7 days answer earlier was assuming you'd already bugged them at the event
12/04/2015, 19:58 - Vanessa: Thanks for your advice
12/04/2015, 19:59 - Vanessa: I will follow up with an email a week later
12/04/2015, 19:59 - Bongo: Np! As with most of my advice I take no responsibility for the outcome
12/04/2015, 19:59 - Vanessa: That's ok
12/04/2015, 19:59 - Vanessa: I'll just remember to lace all your food with sugar
12/04/2015, 20:00 - Bongo: Like my advice to shaggy to keep on drinking when he clearly shouldn't have kept on drinking
12/04/2015, 20:00 - Bongo: Ah dude I've broken the sugar thing hard lately
12/04/2015, 20:01 - Bongo: <Media omitted>
12/04/2015, 20:01 - Bongo: Two words: fizzy laces
12/04/2015, 20:01 - Vanessa: Sunday dinner

13/04/2015, 08:02 - Sam Roberts: üò±
13/04/2015, 08:02 - Sam Roberts: üòµ
13/04/2015, 08:02 - Dave: üíÄ
13/04/2015, 08:02 - Sam Roberts: The story of Oberyn
13/04/2015, 08:02 - Sam Roberts: Haha
13/04/2015, 08:02 - Dave: Too soon
13/04/2015, 08:03 - Dave: üò≠
13/04/2015, 08:14 - Bongo: Woohoo game of thrones! What time are we barbying?
13/04/2015, 08:16 - Sam Roberts: Early if poss, gets dark about 7.30 at the mo, so half six would be great
13/04/2015, 08:17 - Sam Roberts: You ready to make your return as Lord of the lamb chop bong?
13/04/2015, 08:23 - Bongo: üò¶
13/04/2015, 08:23 - Bongo: But there's not enough time to marinade?!
13/04/2015, 08:23 - Bongo: I'll improvise!!
13/04/2015, 08:24 - Mike SJ: Fried egg!
13/04/2015, 08:24 - Bongo: Egg fried between two half cooked pork chops is always a good fall back
13/04/2015, 08:25 - Mike SJ: üéº it's the most, wonderful time, of the year üé∂
13/04/2015, 08:55 - Sam Roberts: Maybe if you massage the marinade it'll soak faster
13/04/2015, 09:24 - Bongo: I heard if you put an egg between the chops it also makes it marinade faster
13/04/2015, 09:33 - Dave: I heard if you put an egg on an egg it makes it eggier
13/04/2015, 09:34 - Dave: üê£
13/04/2015, 09:40 - Tegan: Yay for eggs!
13/04/2015, 09:53 - Alex Bunn: Yay! If you look after them correctly they turn into delicious meat
13/04/2015, 09:54 - Bongo: And sometimes a Jesus pops out
13/04/2015, 09:54 - Tegan: other steps need tobe in place for that to happen
13/04/2015, 09:54 - Alex Bunn: üê£üê•üêîüçóüçó
13/04/2015, 09:54 - Bongo: That's how Easter works right?
13/04/2015, 09:55 - Tegan: When mummt and daddy chickens love each other very much etc

13/04/2015, 12:12 - Shaggy: You were supposed to say hype!
13/04/2015, 12:12 - Bongo: Hype hype hype!
13/04/2015, 12:12 - Shaggy removed Sadie
13/04/2015, 12:13 - Shaggy added Sadie
13/04/2015, 12:14 - Shaggy: Try again
13/04/2015, 12:14 - Sadie: Hype..hype..
13/04/2015, 12:17 - Bongo: Shaggy stop bullying your colleagues
13/04/2015, 12:18 - Shaggy: Bitch, don't tell me what to do
13/04/2015, 12:18 - Shaggy removed Bongo
13/04/2015, 12:21 - Shaggy added Bongo
13/04/2015, 12:39 - Loz: I won't be able to make it tonight but I'm keen to join next week!!
13/04/2015, 12:46 - Bongo: We need to decide on how we're going to watch them
13/04/2015, 12:46 - Bongo: First one today then next three on the weekend?
13/04/2015, 12:46 - Bongo: Or one a week?
13/04/2015, 12:47 - Dave: One a week
13/04/2015, 12:51 - Bongo: Next week round shabongo's?
13/04/2015, 12:51 - Bongo: Or is that going to cause massive aggro from c town lol
13/04/2015, 12:52 - Dave: You'll need a bbq or equivalent delight
13/04/2015, 12:53 - Bongo: Damnit you're right
13/04/2015, 13:00 - Joe Jarman: You don't have a television
13/04/2015, 13:00 - Joe Jarman: Either
13/04/2015, 13:00 - Joe Jarman: Or any furniture
13/04/2015, 13:02 - Joe Jarman: After you've met these requirements, you can submit an application to the game of thrones hosting committee
13/04/2015, 13:08 - Eliza: Two hypes here. What can we bring?
13/04/2015, 13:12 - Bongo: We have furniture, agree about the tv though, we're still working on the 72' screen
13/04/2015, 13:21 - Lorna: Hype!
13/04/2015, 13:50 - Tegan: Further hype!
13/04/2015, 13:51 - Tegan: enough work!
13/04/2015, 13:55 - Bongo: Lol @ people at work
13/04/2015, 13:56 - Alex Bunn: You have the honourable position of replacing the phil as chief meat prep guy
13/04/2015, 13:56 - Alex Bunn: Prep that meat!
13/04/2015, 13:57 - Bongo: Ah bugger I knew I was meant to be doing something
13/04/2015, 13:58 - Bongo: Marinading will seriously take too long
13/04/2015, 13:58 - Bongo: I might just slap sauce on it
13/04/2015, 13:59 - Bongo: If I get the technique right maybe I can punch it into the meat
13/04/2015, 13:59 - Bongo: I'll call Phil, he'll know what to do
13/04/2015, 14:06 - Owen: Bbq sauce
13/04/2015, 14:07 - Owen: You don't need to marrinade if you are using bbq sauce
13/04/2015, 14:16 - Bongo: Ready made BBQ sauce?
13/04/2015, 14:28 - Owen: Could do. It is easy to make though. Eliza might be able to tell you how, her bbq sauce is saucegasmnic!
13/04/2015, 14:34 - Bongo: <Media omitted>
13/04/2015, 14:34 - Bongo: Going to try this with onions, parsley and garlic
13/04/2015, 14:38 - Owen: Mistake! Make your own its easy! We can bring liquid smoke if you are missing that.
13/04/2015, 14:38 - Tegan: How was your interview, dude?
13/04/2015, 14:39 - Owen: Oh yeah! How'd it go?
13/04/2015, 14:57 - Bongo: Ok, we can make it in c town then
13/04/2015, 14:57 - Bongo: I smashed the interview, it's a pretty drawn out one though
13/04/2015, 14:57 - Bongo: Two more rounds, 5 more people to see
13/04/2015, 14:58 - Owen: Did you get asked what you greatest weakness was?
13/04/2015, 14:59 - Bongo: No, mostly experience questions
13/04/2015, 14:59 - Owen: And did you then answer "I often get told I work too hard and well"
13/04/2015, 14:59 - Bongo: Then all of sudden random programming questions I had to write on paper
13/04/2015, 15:01 - Bongo: Lol I've heard some really stupid answers to that question
13/04/2015, 15:01 - Bongo: That's nowhere near as bad as some of them
13/04/2015, 15:02 - Owen: "I often chase other employees with a mallet"... "oh sorry, you wanted me to lie"
13/04/2015, 15:04 - Bongo: Someone said "i start hearing a voice in my head when I get stressed telling me what to do"
13/04/2015, 15:04 - Bongo: Not in an interview I was in, but that's still extremely creepy
13/04/2015, 15:05 - Owen: "I have been told that I am too generous a lover....  Ladies"
13/04/2015, 15:06 - Owen: Wow,  that's mega creepy, why would you answer that in an interview.
13/04/2015, 15:07 - Owen: I bet he went away with the voice saying "nailed it!"
13/04/2015, 15:08 - Bongo: Haha yea "nailed it! Well done chap. Now.. Er.. Burn that chair.."
13/04/2015, 15:09 - Owen: To be fair that is such a pointlessly crap question for anything but a sales job. It's basically the same as asking "could you bull shit for us a bit please"
13/04/2015, 15:18 - Bongo: Yea I've never asked it
13/04/2015, 15:19 - Bongo: I usually ask something along the lines of "if I were to suggest getting wasted for the next hour, what would you do?"
13/04/2015, 15:20 - Owen: I've not been asked it.  To be fair teaching interviews are pretty good.  You just teach a lesson and if you do well then the interview is just to make sure you aren't a complete loon.
13/04/2015, 15:21 - Owen: Is the correct answer "I would"
13/04/2015, 15:25 - Bongo: That only gets half marks
13/04/2015, 15:25 - Bongo: The correct answer is the sound of a beer being opened
13/04/2015, 15:57 - Shaggy: Let's start organizing this shiz
13/04/2015, 16:21 - Owen: What time will someone actually be in at Canning town.  Last time me and Eliza turned up at the designated time there was no one in.
13/04/2015, 16:21 - Angela: I think that's a formal letter of complaint!
13/04/2015, 16:21 - Joe Jarman: Frank.is always in
13/04/2015, 16:22 - Owen: I'm going to make Bbq sauce here.
13/04/2015, 16:22 - Joe Jarman: He hasn't taken to bbqing as much as we hoped
13/04/2015, 16:22 - Owen: He should with a name like frank
13/04/2015, 16:22 - Joe Jarman: He looks like he should be wicked at bbqing
13/04/2015, 16:26 - Alex Bunn: He's all about that protein
13/04/2015, 16:30 - Shaggy: <Media omitted>
13/04/2015, 16:36 - Alex Bunn: üò±
13/04/2015, 16:36 - Alex Bunn: The sassagr flair

13/04/2015, 16:38 - Shaggy: Yes
13/04/2015, 16:38 - Shaggy: I've got to go to balham first though to retrieve my card
13/04/2015, 16:46 - Alex Bunn: Did you leave it in a pub?
13/04/2015, 16:57 - Tegan: I'm aiming for around 6.30
13/04/2015, 16:57 - Tegan: wit vegan delights
13/04/2015, 17:00 - Shaggy: Yup, left without paying the tab
13/04/2015, 17:00 - Bongo: I have the chops btw Owen, if you're good to make the BBQ sauce
13/04/2015, 17:03 - Shaggy: Lol shit, I wish I just said I lost it
13/04/2015, 17:04 - Owen: Bbq sauce is simmering atm
13/04/2015, 17:27 - Lorna: I'll be there for 6:30ish. Any requests for food etc to bring?
13/04/2015, 17:51 - Shaggy: I got the sassage
13/04/2015, 17:51 - Shaggy: As indicated by flair
13/04/2015, 17:56 - Shaggy: Jubilee line is pretty fucked, I would recommend dlr from bank
13/04/2015, 17:57 - Sadie: We're bringing a few burgers, some halloumi, crisps and hummus
13/04/2015, 18:03 - Owen: From where shagzilla?

13/04/2015, 18:14 - Shaggy: I did warn you
13/04/2015, 18:15 - Sam Roberts: Boo meetings
13/04/2015, 18:16 - Sam Roberts: Just jumping in the bike, back in 30
13/04/2015, 18:16 - Sam Roberts: Sorry sorry sorry to anyone who's there before that!
13/04/2015, 18:19 - Mike SJ: Central line is horrendous too agggh
14/04/2015, 07:55 - Tegan: Hey guys - did I leave my bag in your garden?

14/04/2015, 07:59 - Tegan: ooh, can you bring me the green one
14/04/2015, 08:00 - Sam Roberts: I, I'll be there in 5
14/04/2015, 08:02 - Tegan: I'll swap you an awesome coffee
14/04/2015, 08:02 - Tegan: is it super cheeky to ask you to take it to kx with you?
14/04/2015, 08:02 - Sam Roberts: Hehe yes, I'm on it üòâ
14/04/2015, 08:03 - Tegan: Whoop! Thanks Slam
14/04/2015, 08:03 - Sam Roberts: Did you pack it with rocks!?
14/04/2015, 08:04 - Tegan: 'alledgedly' I had too much to 'drink'
14/04/2015, 08:04 - Tegan: Sorry
14/04/2015, 08:05 - Tegan: excellent inaugural Monday, everyone
14/04/2015, 08:38 - Bongo: Haha yea that was thoroughly meaty and game of thronesy
14/04/2015, 08:49 - Sam Roberts: Lot if fun
14/04/2015, 08:49 - Sam Roberts: Our garden looks like Barbageddon
14/04/2015, 08:55 - Mike SJ: Aporkalypse
14/04/2015, 08:57 - Sam Roberts: fitting, Bongo's marinade was the Blend of thyme
14/04/2015, 08:58 - Sam Roberts: Was that the biggest one yet?
14/04/2015, 08:59 - Mike SJ: We all fit in the projector room
14/04/2015, 08:59 - Mike SJ: So no
14/04/2015, 09:00 - Sam Roberts: Ish... Bongo sat on me and Cate
14/04/2015, 09:00 - Shaggy: It's the first year of dual couching
14/04/2015, 09:03 - Owen: Bongo's marinade?  BONGO'S MARINADE?!
14/04/2015, 09:04 - Mike SJ: Good job bongo
14/04/2015, 09:11 - Owen: BBBOOOONNNNGGGGGOOOOOOO!!?!?!?!!!?
14/04/2015, 09:28 - Alex Bunn: Was daario a different guy from last season?
14/04/2015, 09:33 - Mike SJ: Definitely not the original guy
14/04/2015, 09:33 - Mike SJ: <Media omitted>
14/04/2015, 09:37 - Bongo: Cheers guys, I put a lot of love into that marinade
14/04/2015, 10:00 - Alex Bunn: That was the dude from season 3
14/04/2015, 10:17 - Shaggy: Haha
14/04/2015, 11:43 - Owen: A bear walks into a bar, he sits down and immediately mauls to death and devours the woman on the stool next to him. he then calmly orders a beer

bartender: "sorry, we don't serve drug users in here" bear: "but I don't do drugs" bartender: "what about that barbitchyouate"
14/04/2015, 11:55 - Mike SJ: Lol, good joke bongo
14/04/2015, 11:58 - Bongo: Cheers, my creative humour knows no limits
14/04/2015, 11:59 - Owen: Oh god.  This is my worst nightmare.
14/04/2015, 11:59 - Bongo: No it's not I'm actually having a really nice day
14/04/2015, 12:00 - Owen: You'll pay for this in time.
14/04/2015, 12:04 - Owen: Actually I might use this against my more attention seeking pupils. Just start falsely attributing thier behaviour to others and praising them for it.
14/04/2015, 12:13 - Shaggy: Great idea, bongo
14/04/2015, 14:19 - Vanessa: Don't talk of the episode yesterday I still haven't seen it
14/04/2015, 14:32 - Owen: Ned starks ghost came back and ate off jofferys dead face! It was amazing!
14/04/2015, 15:01 - Owen: It also turned out carl drogo and the dragon drogon were the same thing all along... The clue was in the name.
14/04/2015, 15:03 - Angela: http://voteswap.org/
14/04/2015, 15:08 - Shaggy: Carl drogo is basically Carl pilkington as khal
14/04/2015, 15:10 - Owen: Voteswap is awesome.  Its a shame they don't have it for lib dems as well. I have to vote lib dem in my stupid area even though i really don't want to.
14/04/2015, 15:12 - Angela: I would feel like I had to vote labour without it, which I'm not particularly keen to do and would only do cos my MP is good. Voting for ed miliband though, euch
14/04/2015, 15:13 - Dave: This is great
14/04/2015, 15:14 - Shaggy: I like milliband
14/04/2015, 15:14 - Shaggy: He is the only sincere and passionate one
14/04/2015, 15:14 - Shaggy: He may be a bit goofy though
14/04/2015, 15:16 - Shaggy: It doesn't matter what I vote though, in my area it's always been lib dems
14/04/2015, 15:16 - Owen: Problem is that in this country with our stupid system you are very unlikely to get to vote who you want.
14/04/2015, 15:16 - Angela: He may be sincere but he has no ideas of his own
14/04/2015, 15:17 - Dave: I think lib dems may be in for a rough ride this time shagz
14/04/2015, 15:17 - Angela: His main policy is "slightly less austerity than the conservatives"
14/04/2015, 15:17 - Owen: And free bus passes for dogs Angela.
14/04/2015, 15:17 - Angela: But cats though? When will this country see a sensible policy on bus passes for cats?
14/04/2015, 15:18 - Owen: It's like watching the kang and kodos election.
14/04/2015, 15:18 - Dave: Lol
14/04/2015, 15:18 - Owen: Everyone just says what you want to hear and whoever gets into power we are all gonna be slaves to an alien race.
14/04/2015, 15:18 - Owen: Except in my analogy the alien race are the rich.
14/04/2015, 15:19 - Dave: To be fair, there's about a 20bn pound divide between their spending plans as labour don't include capital expenditure
14/04/2015, 15:19 - Dave: *dustball comment*
14/04/2015, 15:20 - Owen: What counts as capital expenditure dave?
14/04/2015, 15:21 - Jimena: <Media omitted>
14/04/2015, 15:22 - Jimena: Free dog passes sound pretty sweet to me.
14/04/2015, 15:22 - Dave: Essentially it's investment, so anything outside of the day to day operating costs of the various departments
14/04/2015, 15:22 - Dave: So it would be money for building roads, houses, schools and statues of Keynes
14/04/2015, 15:23 - Dave: 45CHF! Not under a labour government!
14/04/2015, 15:23 - Owen: What is the reasoning behind not including it?
14/04/2015, 15:24 - Owen: Just because it is a one off?
14/04/2015, 15:24 - Dave: It means they can talk about balancing the books and still have money for investment
14/04/2015, 15:25 - Dave: It's a lot easier to argue for borrowing for investment than for operating costs
14/04/2015, 15:26 - Owen: Oh right.  Like when i bought that yacht, but it didn't affect my bank balance because i don't have to buy the yacht every year.
14/04/2015, 15:26 - Jimena: 45chf AND they are not even allowed on the seats!
14/04/2015, 15:27 - Owen: I'm sorry Jimena i was joking about milliband having free dog bus passes...  As far as i know anyway.
14/04/2015, 15:27 - Owen: Nigel farage only wants free dog passes for British dogs though.
14/04/2015, 15:28 - Owen: All those German Shepherds coming over here! Using our buses for free!
14/04/2015, 15:28 - Owen: And don't get me started on chihuahuas!
14/04/2015, 15:29 - Owen: Direct quote from the ukip party conference
14/04/2015, 15:30 - Dave: You happy with the capital expenditure point now O?
14/04/2015, 15:32 - Dave: Good
14/04/2015, 15:35 - Jimena: Pff typical.
14/04/2015, 15:37 - Jimena: Next thing u know they'll be increasing the bus pass fare for non-eu pets.
14/04/2015, 15:38 - Jimena: Just to cover the costs for the british ones.
14/04/2015, 15:38 - Jimena: üò¢
14/04/2015, 15:41 - Owen: Depends what you mean by happy. I understand what capital expenditure is.  But it seems like bullshit to not include it somehow in the deficit. Like my yacht example. Capital expenditure will still increase country debt so i don't see how you can just inore it.
14/04/2015, 15:42 - Owen: Like why not just add a capital expenditure budget of 20 trillion pounds and then just ignore it.
14/04/2015, 15:43 - Dave: Not sure i follow the last point. Lab have said they will balance the current account so you can't fiddle it with the capital account.
14/04/2015, 15:45 - Dave: On why the two are different. Arguably capital investments will bring a return to the country and which will be commensurate in the long term with the borrowing costs
14/04/2015, 15:45 - Dave: Now i would argue that the same is true of spending on social services, etc but the argument is more controversial
14/04/2015, 15:46 - Owen: I am a keynsian so i agree with extra capital spending.  I just think it is sneaky to not include it somehow.
14/04/2015, 15:46 - Dave: You have to borrow for major infrastructure projects
14/04/2015, 15:46 - Dave: You can't do it on tax revenues
14/04/2015, 15:47 - Owen: I know. But if you are borrowing that should add to the deficit.
14/04/2015, 15:47 - Owen: Even if you offset it across 4 years or something.
14/04/2015, 15:48 - Owen: Or however long their plan is.
14/04/2015, 15:51 - Dave: I don't see why. Current and capital spending are very different. currebt expenditure is like paying for food - one can argue that unless you are starving you shouldn't spend more on food than you earn. Capital spending is like buying a house - it's silly to save up for one, you borrow what you can afford.
14/04/2015, 15:51 - Dave: Idealogically there is a distinction between getting rid of a deficit which if based on all spending and one based on current spending
14/04/2015, 15:52 - Dave: It's not just a way of massaging figures
14/04/2015, 15:53 - Owen: I get that. But this whole deficit balancing task is being played off by both parties as a way of getting the country out of debt (a bit). So hiding the fact that you are increasing the debt even if you are balancing the deficit is disingenuous.
14/04/2015, 15:53 - Mike SJ: None of this matters, it's too boring for voters :b
14/04/2015, 15:56 - Owen: Also i would argue that capital expenditure in the case of a country is a reccuring cost. Just because it is being spent on one off projects doesn't mean another one off project won't come along in a year or two. It isn't the same as me buying a house. 

Also even if you do treat it as the same as me buying a house.  When i buy a house i have to pay it back. Those repayments become part of my personal deficit.  The government will have to payback the money eventually too in whatever means,  inflation or otherwise.
14/04/2015, 15:57 - Angela: But buying a house isn't the same as having a personal deficit because the money grows
14/04/2015, 15:57 - Owen: Mortgage repayments are a personal deficit.
14/04/2015, 15:57 - Angela: And you can borrow against the rising value to gain more money for investment. This isn't the same as just getting into more debt
14/04/2015, 15:58 - Angela: You technically owe more money but your assets are worth more
14/04/2015, 15:58 - Owen: Thata true Angela
14/04/2015, 15:58 - Dave: Indeed, it's a secured loan
14/04/2015, 15:58 - Owen: Thats*
14/04/2015, 15:59 - Owen: Good point
14/04/2015, 15:59 - Angela: I don't know whether the value of whatever the gov is investing in will also grow though?
14/04/2015, 15:59 - Owen: I think I have changed my mind.
14/04/2015, 15:59 - Dave: Although the government can't just sell thw M25
14/04/2015, 15:59 - Dave: Or could they...
14/04/2015, 15:59 - Owen: They could privatise it
14/04/2015, 16:00 - Dave: Indeed
14/04/2015, 16:01 - Owen: This is what I worry about if we get another tory government.
14/04/2015, 16:01 - Angela: Yeah definitely. I mean they sold the Eurostar which is majorly in profit
14/04/2015, 16:01 - Owen: This election has just become about a fucking number.
14/04/2015, 16:01 - Angela: For like 0.00001% deficit reduction
14/04/2015, 16:02 - Owen: And the tories seem to value making that number zero over any othwr concern.
14/04/2015, 16:02 - Angela: It's all clearly ideological
14/04/2015, 16:03 - Dave: Agree
14/04/2015, 16:03 - Owen: David Cameron blatantly talks like that.  When asked about his promises on things like youth unemployment.  His reply is always "those promises weren't the important ones, deficit reduction was"
14/04/2015, 16:06 - Owen: He basically says "i care about making this number zero over anything else, including the people." what irks me is that the media and the other main parties go along with this bullshit. The tory party have very shrewdly changed the message.  So that this election has become about the one thing they actually did achive: deficit reduction.
14/04/2015, 16:06 - Angela: That's so true
14/04/2015, 16:07 - Angela: Labour have completely fallen into line with the Tory 'divide and conquer' mentality of blaming everything bad that happens on people slightly poorer and therefore lazier than you
14/04/2015, 16:07 - Angela: Which I think is a major contributor to the success of ukip
14/04/2015, 16:08 - Owen: Labour and the lib dems should have been calling him on this and they haven't been.  So now its so ingrained that we don't get to discuss people anymore we have to discuss this fucking number. And I don't even get to vote for a party that isn't buying into Cameron bullshit because if I do that waxwork snake will get into power again.  I am fucking sick of it.
14/04/2015, 16:08 - Angela: Haha waxwork snake
14/04/2015, 16:10 - Owen: He looks like a madame tusaauds puppet came alive and then somehow started  running the country
14/04/2015, 16:11 - Angela: Has anybody checked whether the Cameron waxwork is missing...?
14/04/2015, 16:12 - Owen: I take it back.  The madame tussauds Cameron looks more realistic becausr at least it has a moustache.
14/04/2015, 16:12 - Owen: <Media omitted>
14/04/2015, 16:13 - Bongo: I lol'd
14/04/2015, 16:13 - Angela: It actually does look more like a human
14/04/2015, 16:13 - Alex Bunn: Iv enjoyed reading this üëç
14/04/2015, 16:14 - Shaggy: He's get my vote
14/04/2015, 16:14 - Bongo: Reducing the deficit should be one of the highest priorities though
14/04/2015, 16:14 - Owen: Not over people.
14/04/2015, 16:15 - Bongo: Jobs and the economy are affected by the deficit though
14/04/2015, 16:15 - Angela: As I heard someone say on the radio, Tory policies are like deciding not to feed your kids because you want to pay off the mortgage faster
14/04/2015, 16:15 - Bongo: We can choose to ignore it and later down the line pay for it massively
14/04/2015, 16:15 - Owen: The economy is also affected by youth unemployment.
14/04/2015, 16:15 - Bongo: Or deal with it now at the expense of other things
14/04/2015, 16:16 - Bongo: Yea but that trade off unfortunately works in the deficit reduction's favour because we are so massively in debt
14/04/2015, 16:16 - Bongo: Interest on our debt is huuuuge
14/04/2015, 16:17 - Bongo: Reducing it by a linear about is saving us much much more than spending a linear amount on anything
14/04/2015, 16:19 - Dave: Would you accept a tax rise rather than a cut under that logic?
14/04/2015, 16:19 - Owen: Yeah but there are two ways to reduce a defict
14/04/2015, 16:19 - Angela: I would accept big companies being made to pay their tax
14/04/2015, 16:19 - Bongo: Tax rise if everyone on the country agrees that removing debt is the best option
14/04/2015, 16:20 - Bongo: *in
14/04/2015, 16:20 - Owen: You don't have to do it by spending less. You can do it by raising more.  And the fact you didn't think of that first just shows how well the tories have manipulated the media and the other parties.
14/04/2015, 16:20 - Bongo: But you don't want people to move out of the country to avoid tax
14/04/2015, 16:21 - Owen: That is nonsense though bongo.  Its been shown time and time again not to be true.
14/04/2015, 16:21 - Angela: I think a lot of that is scaremongering. When the minimum wage was introduced the main argument against it was that companies would all react by firing a load of employees. But that didn't happen
14/04/2015, 16:21 - Angela: If here's the political will then companies tend to fall into line
14/04/2015, 16:21 - Bongo: People moving out of the country to avoid tax?
14/04/2015, 16:21 - Angela: The will just doesn't exist
14/04/2015, 16:22 - Bongo: Big companies already avoid tax by moving out often he country
14/04/2015, 16:23 - Angela: But they still sell goods in this country
14/04/2015, 16:23 - Angela: And avoid paying tax on those by not being registered here. There's a loophole to be closed
14/04/2015, 16:23 - Bongo: The grey area where startups are starting up in the uk could easily just move to other countries
14/04/2015, 16:23 - Angela: They won't want to stop selling goods here
14/04/2015, 16:23 - Angela: I'm talking about Amazon though, not startups
14/04/2015, 16:24 - Angela: It's about making companies pay the tax that is due, not raising all business tax
14/04/2015, 16:24 - Owen: But you don't increase corporate tax.  You just increase income tax
14/04/2015, 16:24 - Dave: The amount of tax due from corporates but unclaimed would kill the deficit
14/04/2015, 16:25 - Bongo: Yea, let's just do that
14/04/2015, 16:26 - Dave: I may have slightly overstated my last point (need to check the figures) but certainly it would put a fair dent in it
14/04/2015, 16:26 - Angela: I've also heard that it would be more than the deficit
14/04/2015, 16:27 - Owen: No.  Bongo, lets cut public services instead. Especially any service aimed at the weak or poor.
14/04/2015, 16:27 - Bongo: Can we start our own country somewhere hotter than england?
14/04/2015, 16:27 - Angela: Maybe if it's backdated?
14/04/2015, 16:27 - Bongo: No one wants to cut public spending
14/04/2015, 16:28 - Angela: The Conservative party really do
14/04/2015, 16:29 - Bongo: Well that's just silly
14/04/2015, 16:32 - Owen: And the problem is that they won't cut health or education (not that they should) because that would lose them votes. Which means that small departments have to take the hit.  A 1% cut to the NHS would be equivalent to a 50% cut on another department.
14/04/2015, 16:33 - Angela: Though actually neither party is protecting the education budget in their manifesto
14/04/2015, 16:33 - Owen: The NHS could survive a 1% cut.  A little department can't survive a 50% cut and still do what it does.
14/04/2015, 16:33 - Owen: They kept saying that education was a protected area during the debates though.
14/04/2015, 16:34 - Owen: Those little areas are things like libraries. Which are really vital for poor people, but that votera don't generally give a shit about.
14/04/2015, 16:34 - Angela: Yeah they have protected it either against inflation or per pupil, but no party has committed to both. So if pupil numbers rise or there's inflation, it could still potentially decline in real terms
14/04/2015, 16:34 - Dave: A report i just found estimates in 2014, 122bn in lost tax (85bn from avoidance, 19bn avoidance and 18bn tax not paid)
14/04/2015, 16:35 - Owen: 18bn just not paid.  Lol
14/04/2015, 16:35 - Owen: I wish i could get away with just not paying my tax.
14/04/2015, 16:35 - Bongo: Become a contractor
14/04/2015, 16:36 - Shaggy: 85 and 19 are both avoidance?
14/04/2015, 16:36 - Dave: 85 is evasion (ie illegal)
14/04/2015, 16:36 - Dave: 19 avoidance through loopholes
14/04/2015, 16:36 - Bongo: Our deficit last year in total was 107bln
14/04/2015, 16:36 - Bongo: So just that one year of paying would have wiped the slate clean
14/04/2015, 16:36 - Owen: So Dave was right and some.
14/04/2015, 16:37 - Owen: For that year yes.
14/04/2015, 16:37 - Bongo: But given that it's accumulating at such a high rate and the interest accruing on top of that
14/04/2015, 16:38 - Bongo: Just one year of paying it all back would be amazing
14/04/2015, 16:38 - Owen: Interst bill is 43bn alone
14/04/2015, 16:41 - Hannah Murphy: It's all about improving productivity guys! Kthnxbai
14/04/2015, 16:42 - Bongo: Nothing improves productivity like another war
14/04/2015, 16:43 - Bongo: Let's go invade someone
14/04/2015, 16:43 - Shaggy: I nominate tissue
14/04/2015, 16:43 - Owen: After delving into this more.  Wales is getting screwed! They have 6.6% of the uk population but only 2% of its spending. Bull shit.  I am voting plaid cymru
14/04/2015, 16:43 - Shaggy: Russia
14/04/2015, 16:45 - Dave: Wales got a pretty bad deal during devolution compared to scotland
14/04/2015, 16:45 - Owen: Scotland respectivel numbers are 8.4% and 3.7% so they didn't do so well either.
14/04/2015, 16:45 - Bongo: I think we'd get screwed over by Russia personally
14/04/2015, 16:46 - Bongo: It's pretty much straight sailing between them and us
14/04/2015, 16:46 - Owen: Let's take back Australia.  They have barely any defense and loads of resources.
14/04/2015, 16:46 - Dave: Hmm, need to check thoae numbers take account of rhe effects of devolution
14/04/2015, 16:46 - Dave: I heard Scotland had more spending per head than england
14/04/2015, 16:46 - Owen: Yeah I'm not sure exactly what the numbers mean dave.
14/04/2015, 16:47 - Owen: Presumably they don't include  education and health
14/04/2015, 16:48 - Hannah Murphy: Scotland did very well on the free university side of things
14/04/2015, 16:52 - Dave: Bbc (quoting the treasury) states scotland has 10876 per head, wales just under 10000 and england has 8529
14/04/2015, 16:52 - Dave: In 2012-13
14/04/2015, 16:53 - Angela: UKIP should really be focusing on Scotland
14/04/2015, 16:53 - Owen: Ah ok.  The numbers i got must not have included health etc spending in wales under "health" not "wales'
14/04/2015, 16:53 - Angela: Bloody parasites
14/04/2015, 16:55 - Mike SJ: I thought Scotland GDP is higher than average though?
14/04/2015, 16:56 - Mike SJ: Not GDP, but they pay roughly a fair amount of tax considering spending
14/04/2015, 17:25 - Dave: There's a measure called gva (groas value added) which measures how much regions add to gdp. England had 21937 per head and scotland 20013 in 2012 according to the ONS
14/04/2015, 17:27 - Dave: Wikipedia gives 2014 numbers as 24091 and 21982 respectively
14/04/2015, 17:27 - Dave: I am data today
14/04/2015, 17:39 - Bongo: GDP is a bit of a useless stat though right?
14/04/2015, 17:52 - Lorna: Free Ben and Jerry's ice cream! And sunshine and park! Heading to marble arch now for all of the above x
14/04/2015, 17:56 - Owen: Two economists are walking down the road and see a turd.  One says to the other I'll give you ¬£20,000 to eat that turd. The other weighs up his options and decides eating it is the rational choice. They keep walking and now the second one sees a turd, he proposes the first eats it for ¬£20,000. The first makes the rational choice and eats it. They keep walking for a bit and the first says wait a minute we both have as much money as we did before the walk but our mouths taste like shit. The second replies "yes, but we increased our GDP by ¬£40,000"
14/04/2015, 17:56 - Owen: TLDR yes bongo gdp is a pretty silly stat.
14/04/2015, 18:04 - Bongo: It's a ridiculously old one that needs updating
14/04/2015, 18:06 - Bongo: I'd give a medal to anyone who can give a number to a country's output
14/04/2015, 18:07 - Owen: I think how many times i mention my own name should be one.  I only do that during periods of growth.
14/04/2015, 18:07 - Owen: Actually mike.  You should graph that.
14/04/2015, 18:07 - Owen: See if it is at all true

15/04/2015, 15:37 - Hannah Murphy: After the last election I got a message saying my vote didn't count cos they didn't believe it was me!!! It was!!! Accused of fraud against myself...

15/04/2015, 15:38 - Tegan: fountains are nice and it stays sunny for ages
15/04/2015, 15:38 - Tegan: No head though
15/04/2015, 15:38 - Tegan: I'd be livid if I got a letter after the fact to say they'd discounted my vote! I wonder how many people that happened to
15/04/2015, 15:40 - Lorna: How do they know which vote is yours?
15/04/2015, 15:41 - Tegan: Good point. ..

17/04/2015, 18:52 - Lorna: What's going on with the wrestling? When? How much?
17/04/2015, 18:52 - Bongo: That was meant to be an exclamation mark
17/04/2015, 18:53 - Mike SJ: I think you're basing your opinion entirely on the poster you saw
17/04/2015, 18:53 - Mike SJ: I know three people who went, all said it was hilarious
17/04/2015, 18:53 - Tegan: The wrestling looks to be sold out
17/04/2015, 18:54 - Tegan: Which is a bit of a pity, but I guess predictable
17/04/2015, 18:55 - Tegan: Although if you guys want to ask if they're selling tickets on the door I might be interested - it does look pretty awesome :)
17/04/2015, 18:56 - Bongo: I saw the 20 min trailer Sam showed me
17/04/2015, 18:56 - Bongo: It looked so bad it might be good

17/04/2015, 19:00 - Bongo: No
17/04/2015, 19:00 - Bongo: Maybe that's why
17/04/2015, 19:01 - Bongo: But then, I'm the kind of person who could watch a blank wall wasted and find it funny

18/04/2015, 12:22 - Owen: I'm gonna go with the second one.  Because it just seems like a string of random letters,  much like programming seems to me at the moment.
18/04/2015, 12:36 - Bongo: Yoji will make you program three times as fast
18/04/2015, 12:38 - Bongo: And probably make twice as many mistakes

22/04/2015, 18:50 - Mike SJ: My brother went to see it on Sunday in Cambridge
22/04/2015, 19:06 - Tegan: It's yet another directors cut
22/04/2015, 19:06 - Tegan: The final one
22/04/2015, 19:07 - Mike SJ: Like final fantasy
22/04/2015, 19:08 - Tegan: Apparently he's fixing all the inconsistencies his cult fan base have been pointing out over the last 20 years
22/04/2015, 19:08 - Tegan: Can't make it tonight, but look forward to your reaction o & e
22/04/2015, 19:08 - Tegan: How was drawing along with Stubbs?
22/04/2015, 19:08 - Dave: That sounds cool, would love to see it
22/04/2015, 19:09 - Dave: Is deckard a replicant? You may learn tonight...
22/04/2015, 19:10 - Mike SJ: Stupid cult fanbase

22/04/2015, 19:19 - Dave: If you know what i mean
22/04/2015, 19:20 - Dave: <Media omitted>
22/04/2015, 19:26 - Owen: Oh I thought you meant you were googling yourself.
22/04/2015, 20:47 - Shaggy: What's the surname of the royal family?
22/04/2015, 20:48 - Sam Roberts: Windsor!!
22/04/2015, 20:48 - Dave: Like a painful fart
22/04/2015, 20:49 - Shaggy: Is it? I thought it's just the castle
22/04/2015, 20:50 - Sam Roberts: Ah I thought it was a trick
22/04/2015, 20:50 - Sam Roberts: Aren't they technically German?
22/04/2015, 20:51 - Shaggy: <Media omitted>
22/04/2015, 21:07 - Shaggy: <Media omitted>
22/04/2015, 21:35 - Sam Roberts: Mononyms
22/04/2015, 21:35 - Sam Roberts: Like Madonna
22/04/2015, 22:26 - Bongo: It's a conspiracy to hide the fact that the Mongols wiped out what is currently known as Western Europe
23/04/2015, 09:15 - Joe Jarman: üáΩüá™
23/04/2015, 09:15 - Joe Jarman: Happy st George
23/04/2015, 09:24 - Tegan: Racist
23/04/2015, 09:24 - Tegan: :)
23/04/2015, 09:34 - Joe Jarman: We should definitely get a day
23/04/2015, 09:34 - Joe Jarman: It's really unfair!!

23/04/2015, 12:41 - Alex Bunn: Sound advice shags
23/04/2015, 12:57 - Shaggy: It's a pub near me, I don't want to take credit for it
23/04/2015, 17:45 - Shaggy: Eliza, was it you who posted vote swap? Have you seen http://www.swapmyvote.uk? It's basically the same but more choices
23/04/2015, 17:46 - Angela: It was me - no I haven't seen that
23/04/2015, 17:46 - Shaggy: Ah sorry
23/04/2015, 17:46 - Shaggy: All women are the same
23/04/2015, 17:50 - Angela: It's a nice idea to include more parties, I wonder how many people use it
23/04/2015, 17:52 - Shaggy: 1000 so far
23/04/2015, 17:52 - Shaggy: It was launched last week
23/04/2015, 18:46 - Sam Roberts: Anyone around for a beeah
23/04/2015, 18:46 - Sam Roberts: Beeeeeyah
23/04/2015, 18:46 - Sam Roberts: Beer
23/04/2015, 18:47 - Shaggy: Feeling a bit ill, so I'll pass
23/04/2015, 19:51 - Alex Bunn: Yes. Where?
23/04/2015, 19:52 - Alex Bunn: Balls. I dont have my bike lock todayüò´
23/04/2015, 19:52 - Alex Bunn: Beers at home üçª?
23/04/2015, 19:53 - Sam Roberts: Beers at home! Just leaving kings kiss
23/04/2015, 19:55 - Alex Bunn: Gonna leave work in 10
23/04/2015, 20:44 - Steven: Become a contractor and for those last 3 hours you would have been paid!
23/04/2015, 20:52 - Sam Roberts: There's so much more than money ste
23/04/2015, 20:52 - Sam Roberts: Like, uh, job satisfaction?
23/04/2015, 20:52 - Sam Roberts: Lo
23/04/2015, 20:52 - Sam Roberts: Lol
23/04/2015, 22:33 - Steven: 3 hours extra = 3 hours job satisfaction + 3 hours extra pay -> best
23/04/2015, 22:36 - Mike SJ: My only problem with contracting is everyone where you work will be bitching about you
24/04/2015, 00:03 - Dave: Pretty sure they're bitching about you anyway mikr
24/04/2015, 00:03 - Dave: Mike
24/04/2015, 07:06 - Alex Bunn: Oooo. Burn
24/04/2015, 09:36 - Bongo: Yea contractors get auto-uninvited to everything
24/04/2015, 09:37 - Tegan: I really like my contractors. I just can't rely on them to do the work I've asked them to do.
24/04/2015, 09:37 - Tegan: Maybe I need new contractors....
24/04/2015, 09:37 - Bongo: Incompetent contractors don't count
24/04/2015, 09:38 - Tegan: I'm told they are very competent
24/04/2015, 09:39 - Tegan: They just can't do stuff as awesome as me
24/04/2015, 09:42 - Bongo: Go contracting tegs!
24/04/2015, 10:09 - Tegan: Spending my Friday in the cafe of a shiny 'club lab' workspace on the canal near westborne park
24/04/2015, 10:10 - Tegan: <Media omitted>
24/04/2015, 10:10 - Shaggy: Oh wow
24/04/2015, 10:10 - Shaggy: That's inspiring
24/04/2015, 10:10 - Dave: God
24/04/2015, 10:10 - Shaggy: Vb is my role model
24/04/2015, 10:10 - Tegan: Right?
24/04/2015, 10:11 - Dave: It's such a bland quote too
24/04/2015, 10:11 - Dave: She's clearly not tried to achieve creative prowess
24/04/2015, 10:11 - Dave: Or just not worked very hard on it
24/04/2015, 10:12 - Vanessa: What do you think of that workspace?
24/04/2015, 10:12 - Vanessa: Besides the quote
24/04/2015, 10:12 - Tegan: besides the quote, it sends shiny and new
24/04/2015, 10:12 - Tegan: Seems
24/04/2015, 10:12 - Vanessa: Yes they have spaces all over London
24/04/2015, 10:12 - Tegan: It's attached to the Nido, which has gym, foosball, etc
24/04/2015, 10:12 - Tegan: I don't understand who these entrepreneurs are
24/04/2015, 10:13 - Vanessa: Oh that's very clever of them
24/04/2015, 10:13 - Tegan: Who can afford this biz
24/04/2015, 10:14 - Vanessa: Some of the workspaces are super expensive and I feel the same, what start up can afford ¬£300+ a month
24/04/2015, 10:14 - Vanessa: But it's the potential network that you can connect to I guess that balances it out
24/04/2015, 10:14 - Tegan: Right? Also the coffee is less good than average
24/04/2015, 10:14 - Vanessa: That's is not good
24/04/2015, 10:15 - Tegan: I guess so - feels like a bit of a veneer to me
24/04/2015, 10:15 - Tegan: clever business model for the owners though
24/04/2015, 10:18 - Shaggy: Assuming you mean 300 per month per desk, I don't think that's expensive
24/04/2015, 10:19 - Tegan: It is if you're just starting out and you're paying rent somewhere
24/04/2015, 10:19 - Tegan: If you have something already established and have a source of income it's ok
24/04/2015, 10:21 - Vanessa: Yes that's what I mean by expensive
24/04/2015, 10:21 - Vanessa: Especially if you're just one person
24/04/2015, 10:22 - Shaggy: If you're talking about someone with no funds who needs a desk then of course, that's what the library is for. A startup will already have been invested in and for a few people that's good value for manly compared to an actual office
24/04/2015, 10:23 - Dave: I'm good value for manly
24/04/2015, 10:23 - Tegan: l I'll
24/04/2015, 10:23 - Tegan: I meant lol
24/04/2015, 10:23 - Vanessa: Workspaces offer flexibility compared to renting an actual space that is why people like them
24/04/2015, 10:23 - Tegan: That makes sense Shaggy - so that's why everyone is swaggering around here
24/04/2015, 10:23 - Tegan: They have 'investment'
24/04/2015, 10:24 - Shaggy: Flexibility is not the main point, if you want a flexible work space it's cheaper
24/04/2015, 10:28 - Vanessa: Flexibility is one of the main selling points for start ups. They don't want to have to go through the whole process of ordering Internet, buying a printer, being stuck in a contract of a year, etc
24/04/2015, 10:28 - Bongo: Lol @that quote, I'm in a similar workspace filled with silly quotes
24/04/2015, 10:28 - Vanessa: But there are many other reasons for workspaces
24/04/2015, 10:28 - Vanessa: A library doesn't offer what a workspace does for someone wanting to start a business
24/04/2015, 10:28 - Bongo: Worst one is probably "winning means you're willing to go longer, work longer and give more than anyone else" - vince Lombardi
24/04/2015, 10:29 - Vanessa: Which workspace are you in bongo?
24/04/2015, 10:29 - Tegan: lol
24/04/2015, 10:29 - Tegan: There are some hilarious ones in my office
24/04/2015, 10:29 - Tegan: I'll add to the inspirational quote library tomorrow
24/04/2015, 10:29 - Bongo: I'm in the royal exchange
24/04/2015, 10:29 - Tegan: No, wait, it's the weekend!
24/04/2015, 10:29 - Bongo: It's this transition consultancy near bank
24/04/2015, 10:30 - Vanessa: Never heard of that one
24/04/2015, 10:31 - Bongo: I got hooked up through Gs
24/04/2015, 10:31 - Shaggy: Exactly, so workspace is cheap compared to an office
24/04/2015, 10:31 - Vanessa: But that's what I said
24/04/2015, 10:31 - Vanessa: Cheap and flexible
24/04/2015, 10:32 - Shaggy: You said it's expensive
24/04/2015, 10:32 - Tegan: I love it when everyone is really agreeing, but they think they're arguing
24/04/2015, 10:32 - Vanessa: Yes it's expensive for many start ups
24/04/2015, 10:32 - Tegan: expensive if you have no money
24/04/2015, 10:32 - Vanessa: Exactly
24/04/2015, 10:32 - Shaggy: That's a dumb thing to say
24/04/2015, 10:32 - Tegan: Like so many things in life :)
24/04/2015, 10:32 - Tegan: You're a dumb thing to say
24/04/2015, 10:32 - Shaggy: Everything is expensive if you have no manly
24/04/2015, 10:32 - Tegan: lol
24/04/2015, 10:33 - Vanessa: And sometimes the initial phase is where a coworking space would work because you need to be surrounded by the right people
24/04/2015, 10:33 - Tegan: Dave's got some of that
24/04/2015, 10:33 - Vanessa: But you can't because you any afford it
24/04/2015, 10:34 - Shaggy: Anyway, I might well be in one of those in a few months
24/04/2015, 10:34 - Vanessa: How come?
24/04/2015, 10:35 - Shaggy: Have to move to new office, but don't have anywhere to go yet
24/04/2015, 10:35 - Vanessa: Look at Central Working
24/04/2015, 10:41 - Vanessa: But if I get a job at Wework then you'll have to sign up there
24/04/2015, 10:42 - Shaggy: Mateusz is already trying to convince me
24/04/2015, 10:42 - Shaggy: It's not my decision however
24/04/2015, 10:43 - Vanessa: Yes but you can still be influential
24/04/2015, 10:43 - Vanessa: In the decision making
24/04/2015, 10:43 - Shaggy: Throw my toys out of the pram
24/04/2015, 10:45 - Bongo: Put ketamine in the coffee jar
24/04/2015, 10:46 - Tegan: Will that help?
24/04/2015, 10:46 - Alex Bunn: "I love it when everyone is really agreeing, but they think they're arguing" - classic shaggy
24/04/2015, 10:46 - Alex Bunn: I know tegan said it. But suma shaggy up well
24/04/2015, 10:47 - Mike SJ: Shaggy : WFHPARTY
24/04/2015, 10:47 - Mike SJ: That would be cheap
24/04/2015, 10:51 - Tegan: funsies :)
24/04/2015, 12:33 - Owen: Smart phones ruined arguments with shaggy.
24/04/2015, 12:33 - Owen: They used to be so much fun, but now I can prove him wrong in seconds.

24/04/2015, 12:47 - Tegan: headlines: Britains are happy.  Canadians like poo.
24/04/2015, 13:13 - Alex Bunn: Good headlines üòäüí©
24/04/2015, 13:23 - Tegan: Now I can't tell what nationality you are
24/04/2015, 13:23 - Shaggy: Britons?
24/04/2015, 13:24 - Tegan: Sorry, is that racist?
24/04/2015, 13:26 - Shaggy: I don't need smartphone to prove you wrong, Owen, just an egg
24/04/2015, 13:27 - Tegan: he he. Is that one of the defining moments of your life, Owen?
24/04/2015, 14:15 - Owen: Unfortunately so. That time I rescued a baby from a burning building is overshadowed by a small egg mishap.
24/04/2015, 18:09 - Bongo: <Media omitted>
24/04/2015, 18:27 - Owen: Hahahha
24/04/2015, 18:28 - Owen: Thats great

24/04/2015, 18:38 - Bongo: Also, have you been messing around with autocorrect again shag?
24/04/2015, 18:38 - Bongo: "Pig, the dog, interviews Scarlett johansen"
24/04/2015, 18:38 - Bongo: I think it's actually legit this time
24/04/2015, 18:42 - Tegan: lol
25/04/2015, 13:08 - Alex Bunn: Currently at a boozy brunch in the city
25/04/2015, 13:08 - Alex Bunn: Bad egg, unlimited booze

25/04/2015, 13:40 - Sam Roberts: How late is it unlimited for? Could swing by in an hour or so!
25/04/2015, 13:49 - Shaggy: We can host bloody marys here, just need vodka and tomato juice üòÅ
25/04/2015, 13:53 - Alex Bunn: I dunno. Our sesh finishes at two
25/04/2015, 13:53 - Alex Bunn: 2 hour time limit
25/04/2015, 13:54 - Shaggy: Oh lol
25/04/2015, 13:54 - Shaggy: So it's not unlimited
25/04/2015, 13:56 - Alex Bunn: Its unlimited for two hours!
25/04/2015, 14:02 - Sam Roberts: That would be really bad for my health
25/04/2015, 14:02 - Sam Roberts: I'm in
25/04/2015, 15:32 - Shaggy: <Media omitted>

27/04/2015, 14:50 - Owen: Wait.  ¬£15!
27/04/2015, 14:50 - Owen: Thats an expensive cocktail. I thought it was free!
27/04/2015, 14:52 - Alex Bunn: I'll wingman you buddy
27/04/2015, 14:54 - Bongo: Cool, just don't be too charming
27/04/2015, 14:55 - Bongo: It's may 13th at the neo Barbican from 6pm

27/04/2015, 14:56 - Alex Bunn: We'll be such a team
27/04/2015, 14:56 - Bongo: Lol
27/04/2015, 14:56 - Bongo: You do realise the speed dating is individual, it's not going to be all four of us chatting up a girl
27/04/2015, 14:56 - Alex Bunn: We can be bad speed dates to make you look good by comparison
27/04/2015, 14:57 - Bongo: Oh I see what you mean
27/04/2015, 14:57 - Bongo: Yea awesome
27/04/2015, 15:01 - Owen: Hi,  I'm Owen, I have syphilis and like long walks in the abattoir.
27/04/2015, 15:02 - Owen: Hi I'm Bunn i am mainly looking for a someone to emotionally neglect and ignore except for sex.
27/04/2015, 15:03 - Owen: Hi, I'm bongo, *insert witty comment about how this place is full of creeps*
27/04/2015, 15:03 - Owen: Step 4 profit
27/04/2015, 15:14 - Bongo: Got 2 tix, no need to pay me back Bunn, just be terrible
27/04/2015, 15:14 - Alex Bunn: Done
27/04/2015, 15:14 - Bongo: Hi I'm Bunn, the best thing about living with my mum is that she lets me play computer games all day and doesn't complain about not washing myself
27/04/2015, 15:18 - Tegan: Sometimes I let her wash me
27/04/2015, 15:19 - Bongo: 10 points if you bring 3 toy dinosaurs with you and put them on your desk facing her
27/04/2015, 15:20 - Owen: To be fair if a girl did that to me that would be an instant win for her.
27/04/2015, 15:20 - Bongo: Yea true
27/04/2015, 15:20 - Owen: Swoon.
27/04/2015, 15:21 - Bongo: I think we're a lot nerdier than average though
27/04/2015, 15:22 - Owen: Nerdyness is kinda cool now though.
27/04/2015, 15:25 - Owen: Technology is in everyones pockets so not knowing how to use it is a bit meh.
27/04/2015, 15:26 - Owen: When we were younger it was nerds that could do computer stuff because no one else really used them. But now thats changed. It's the new version of being handy.

29/04/2015, 16:48 - Owen: You're thinking of mongols
29/04/2015, 16:54 - Bongo: <Media omitted>
29/04/2015, 16:58 - Bongo: That's meant to be the expression of not being impressed
29/04/2015, 16:58 - Bongo: But, Mongol as they are, that could also be the look of rape and pillaging
29/04/2015, 17:01 - Dave: He's being raped in that very picture
29/04/2015, 17:02 - Dave: Just not a very impressive rape

29/04/2015, 18:24 - Shaggy: A trick question, touch√©
29/04/2015, 18:27 - Mike Joyce: Your mistake was being born....you technically entered the contract at that point.
29/04/2015, 18:29 - Bongo: That's the conservative political slogan for poor people

01/05/2015, 09:45 - Mike SJ: wat

01/05/2015, 11:51 - Bongo: I've only just noticed the Asian emoji
01/05/2015, 11:51 - Bongo: üë≤
01/05/2015, 11:51 - Bongo: That's so mega racist
01/05/2015, 11:52 - Owen: üë≥
01/05/2015, 11:55 - Tegan: is it more racist to depict an Asian, or to not have an option for Asian people who want to express themselves as emoji?
01/05/2015, 11:55 - Tegan: Asians are not the prophet mohammed
01/05/2015, 11:56 - Tegan: I don't really feel adequately represented by this lady üôé
01/05/2015, 11:58 - Shaggy: üëπ this represents me well
01/05/2015, 12:00 - Bongo: It's the slanted eyes that makes it racist though
01/05/2015, 12:01 - Bongo: Also where's the black emoji?
01/05/2015, 12:02 - Bongo: I bet they were like "okay so for the other races we have a different skin colour and something distinguishable about the race, so what distinguishing feature about black people should we include on the emoji..."
01/05/2015, 12:03 - Alex Bunn: üí© here's the black guy
01/05/2015, 12:04 - Alex Bunn: Oh no he dint!
01/05/2015, 12:04 - Shaggy: There are actually new emoji that include all shades of white
01/05/2015, 12:05 - Shaggy: And lol @ bunn's comment
01/05/2015, 12:09 - Mike SJ: Emoji were set by the japanese
01/05/2015, 12:09 - Bongo: Ah, they hate black people more than anyone
01/05/2015, 12:10 - Owen: Wow.  There isn't a black emoji!
01/05/2015, 12:10 - Bongo: That makes üë≤marginally less racist
01/05/2015, 12:10 - Bongo: But what about üåö
01/05/2015, 12:11 - Jimena: üë≤ doesnt have slanted eyes. What makes u think he is chinese?
01/05/2015, 12:12 - Bongo: And I feel üë®is misrepresenting pesos everywhere
01/05/2015, 12:12 - Jimena: üë≤üèø
01/05/2015, 12:12 - Bongo: *pedos
01/05/2015, 12:12 - Bongo: The eyes are narrowed
01/05/2015, 12:12 - Bongo: You have to look real close
01/05/2015, 12:13 - Alex Bunn: He's squinting!
01/05/2015, 12:13 - Alex Bunn: Thats the squinting emoji
01/05/2015, 12:13 - Bongo: Plus the cap is a traditional Chinese hat
01/05/2015, 12:13 - Mike SJ: Japan definitely hate China
01/05/2015, 12:13 - Jimena: Tourist?
01/05/2015, 12:13 - Bongo: That's definitely a possibility
01/05/2015, 12:14 - Bongo: "Squinting tourist"
01/05/2015, 12:14 - Bongo: Although that's rather specific for an emoji
01/05/2015, 12:14 - Jimena: Lol
01/05/2015, 12:14 - Mike SJ: Do emoji look the same on Android / iPhone?
01/05/2015, 12:14 - Bongo: If they have "squinting tourist" why the hell don't that have Asian people?!
01/05/2015, 12:14 - Mike SJ: <Media omitted>
01/05/2015, 12:15 - Bongo: Yea looks the same to me
01/05/2015, 12:16 - Mike SJ: I don't know who makes the pictures, like there's those weird yellow blob ones on some apps
01/05/2015, 12:16 - Jimena: Noo looks different
01/05/2015, 12:16 - Jimena: How do u make screen shots
01/05/2015, 12:16 - Bongo: Do you have an iPhone?
01/05/2015, 12:17 - Jimena: Yeah
01/05/2015, 12:17 - Bongo: Top right button and centre circle button at the same time
01/05/2015, 12:17 - Bongo: <Media omitted>
01/05/2015, 12:18 - Jimena: <Media omitted>

01/05/2015, 12:20 - Jimena: Kudos to u for asking if we are all seeing the same thing
01/05/2015, 12:20 - Jimena: That was a real philosophic move
01/05/2015, 12:20 - Bongo: Your Asian dude doesn't have slanted eyes as well
01/05/2015, 12:20 - Jimena: üëçüèø
01/05/2015, 12:20 - Bongo: It is very philosophic
01/05/2015, 12:21 - Bongo: Maybe in real life some people don't see black people, but an Asian dude with an alien standing next to him
01/05/2015, 12:21 - Jimena: Btw that emoji is meant to be a black thumbs up
01/05/2015, 12:21 - Bongo: That would explain a lot of the racial hate that's been going on
01/05/2015, 12:22 - Jimena: But maybe ur phone is reading it as a a penis and an alien
01/05/2015, 12:22 - Bongo: Don't worry it's a thumbs up and an alien
01/05/2015, 12:23 - Jimena: üí© and this one is an ice cream
01/05/2015, 12:48 - Alex Bunn: So naive
01/05/2015, 12:51 - Tegan: Wow.  IPhone Asian is bright yellow!

01/05/2015, 17:05 - Mike SJ: Multiple posts in a row from one person count as 1
01/05/2015, 17:05 - Owen: 15,000
01/05/2015, 17:10 - Mike SJ: Damn close. This is the 15,556th post
01/05/2015, 17:19 - Owen: Nice.
01/05/2015, 17:20 - Tegan: When did Owen and Hannah have their brass instrument off?
01/05/2015, 17:26 - Alex Bunn: I was thinking that!
01/05/2015, 17:27 - Bongo: Lol I'd pay to see that
01/05/2015, 17:50 - Shaggy: Any beer plan tonight?
01/05/2015, 18:33 - Tegan: negatory- boating tonight
01/05/2015, 19:40 - Lorna: So what's the deal with brunch places doing unlimited bloody Marys? Anyone know a good one? And want to go sometime soon?
01/05/2015, 22:06 - Dave: Don't know. No. Yes.
02/05/2015, 17:33 - Tegan: While festival shopping, Dave just applied the logic: what would Bunn do?
02/05/2015, 17:34 - Tegan: You should be proud, man
02/05/2015, 18:14 - Dave: We got a load of rum
04/05/2015, 11:57 - Alex Bunn: Haha awesome
05/05/2015, 10:37 - Lorna: Is anyone planning to stay up and watch the election results? Sick days on Friday!
05/05/2015, 10:40 - Tegan: we did that last time when there was likely to be a hung parliament
05/05/2015, 10:40 - Tegan: Long night
05/05/2015, 10:42 - Lorna: Worth it? There's pubs staying open, and serving early breakfasts..
05/05/2015, 10:43 - Owen: The counting lasted until about 10 the next morning last time. I will probably just wake up and pay attention to it during the day.
05/05/2015, 13:41 - Dave: I'm thinking the same. Hung parliament and hungover doesn't sound like a good friday
05/05/2015, 13:51 - Tegan: What time does the coverage start though?  I'm up for ending the evening in a left leaving pub for sure
05/05/2015, 13:51 - Tegan: seeing how things stand at bed o clock
05/05/2015, 14:10 - Lorna: Voting closes at 10, and counting starts straight after that, not sure when the first results come in though
05/05/2015, 14:12 - Lorna: Also, hoping the pub will not be left leaving at the end of the night!
05/05/2015, 15:37 - Tegan: Now that I look at it, I'm really not sure what that would mean. .
05/05/2015, 16:06 - Shaggy: I assume you wanted to type "leaning"
05/05/2015, 16:36 - Tegan: Thanks shags
05/05/2015, 19:17 - Dan Sluckin: I was hoping to find a bar that is showing coverage, perhaps with a swingometer. Is there anywhere central?
05/05/2015, 19:18 - Dan Sluckin: Westminster?
05/05/2015, 19:18 - Shaggy: Probably inside
05/05/2015, 19:30 - Owen: Let's make our own swingometer
05/05/2015, 21:07 - Jimena: <Media omitted>
05/05/2015, 21:11 - Dave: ‚ò∫
06/05/2015, 10:18 - Jimena: So im making a sort of app with a wheel of fortune type thing. The idea is it should be something u could have up on a screen in a pub. Customer pays say 2 quid and gets to have a spin
06/05/2015, 10:19 - Jimena: My question is what should the different wheel outcomes be?
06/05/2015, 10:20 - Jimena: I was thinking for example 'Headshot: you get the nastiest shot in the bar'
06/05/2015, 10:21 - Jimena: 'Showtime: bartenders perform some silly dance song'
06/05/2015, 10:21 - Jimena: Any ideas? I feel quite uninspired
06/05/2015, 10:23 - Shaggy: It's too early in the morning, I think I need a couple headshots for inspiration
06/05/2015, 10:34 - Jimena: Really? Cuz the nastiest shot i ever had was an Abortion: vodka and tabasco. Shall i get u a couple?
06/05/2015, 10:41 - Bongo: Surely that's just a mini Bloody Mary
06/05/2015, 10:41 - Bongo: I'm up for that
06/05/2015, 10:41 - Shaggy: Ugh shot if vodka, no thanks
06/05/2015, 10:42 - Bongo: Pretty much all the options are going to be about drinking right?
06/05/2015, 10:42 - Bongo: How about, "designated driver downs 4 pints"
06/05/2015, 10:43 - Bongo: Or everyone with their first name starting with the person who spun the wheel takes a shot
06/05/2015, 10:47 - Bongo: Oh wait these are meant to be rewarding for the person spinning
06/05/2015, 11:34 - Tegan: Dares are quite good
06/05/2015, 11:34 - Tegan: 'Get yourself thrown out of the pub'
06/05/2015, 11:35 - Tegan: or scavenger hunt type ones
06/05/2015, 11:35 - Tegan: 'Steal a suit's wallet, then buy your friends a drink'
06/05/2015, 11:52 - Sam Roberts: I like the mix... Some to get you drunk, some to get you happy, some to get you arrested
06/05/2015, 11:53 - Sam Roberts: Needs a jackpot... Win a bottle of wine?
06/05/2015, 11:53 - Sam Roberts: New Andreya Triana album out btw, real soulful
06/05/2015, 11:54 - Sam Roberts: Oh, if it's a commercial app, should have a pretty boring set as standard, with a content editor tool so pubs can set their own
06/05/2015, 11:55 - Sam Roberts: You could probably buy a set of standard graphics to cut out a huge amount of work, e.g. Fireworks on jackpot
06/05/2015, 13:10 - Pete Morey: Give ppl a set of icons that they have to draw on their own/each other's hands.  Then you can use those icons on the wheel to preface any 'nominate'  type activity.  Gives an extra interactive element which would work in a pub. I've used similar idea in comedy with a projector + basic frame animation scrolling through the icons.
06/05/2015, 13:18 - Owen: Release a pack of wild wolves into the pub and lock the doors, the last person alive gets a free pint.
06/05/2015, 13:19 - Shaggy: Of blood
06/05/2015, 13:24 - Bongo: That's more of a five quid wheel than two
06/05/2015, 13:25 - Owen: You're right bongo. Let's replace the wolves with geese.
06/05/2015, 13:26 - Bongo: "Spinner has to become a leader of a cult and sacrifice and overthrow any government of their choosing"
06/05/2015, 13:38 - Tegan: spinner could decide what animal gets released into the pub
06/05/2015, 13:39 - Tegan: wolves is like the ¬£20 bonus question
06/05/2015, 13:39 - Tegan: other options could be guinea pigs, starlings, spiders
06/05/2015, 14:28 - Pete Morey: Hehehe
06/05/2015, 17:20 - Jimena: Thank you all for your fantastic suggestions. I had a good laugh reading them
06/05/2015, 17:23 - Jimena: The website/app is mot a commercial project. Just a project to add to a little portfolio immaking  to apply for jobs in web development
06/05/2015, 17:27 - Jimena: I figured that my combo of degrees in philosophy and education plus my teaching experience wouldnt do the trick
06/05/2015, 17:28 - Jimena: Despite some very eloquent motivation letters üò¢
06/05/2015, 17:43 - Bongo: Sounds cool, is it a mobile app or web app?
06/05/2015, 17:45 - Jimena: Web
06/05/2015, 17:45 - Jimena: In javascript
06/05/2015, 17:47 - Bongo: We have a coding group on here if you want to join, for any questions, most of us have experience with front end dev
06/05/2015, 17:47 - Bongo: I'm pretty new to front end dev myself so it's been really handy
06/05/2015, 17:49 - Jimena: Oooh yes please
06/05/2015, 17:50 - Jimena: Im pretty new to the whole shebang: wrote my first line of code last dec
06/05/2015, 17:51 - Bongo: Ossum, you're probably much better than me in that case
06/05/2015, 17:57 - Jimena: Thankyouuuüòé
07/05/2015, 07:38 - Dave: Election day! üçÜ
07/05/2015, 07:39 - Dave: Did anyone at canning town find my polling card? It was on the fridge when it first arrived then vanished
07/05/2015, 08:18 - Mike SJ: Can't see it sorry man, I remember seeing someone's card on the floor, but I'm 99% sure it was Bunn or Sam's
07/05/2015, 07:45 - Angela: I don't think you need it
07/05/2015, 07:46 - Dave: Having checked it seems i don't. Still would have liked to wave it around.
07/05/2015, 07:47 - Alex Bunn: Dont need it
07/05/2015, 07:47 - Alex Bunn: Voted üôå

07/05/2015, 07:59 - Owen: Anti-hype
07/05/2015, 08:00 - Owen: Go hung parliament! That thing that was meant to happen if we voted AV
07/05/2015, 08:01 - Tegan: and then that thing that happened in Belgium where they didn't have a government for the best part of a year
07/05/2015, 08:05 - Lorna: Yeah but that's Belgium for you
07/05/2015, 08:05 - Owen: To busy eating waffles amiright. Vote UKIP!!
07/05/2015, 08:06 - Tegan: They were a'ight

07/05/2015, 08:11 - Tegan: Have you guys had to queue?
07/05/2015, 08:19 - Hannah Murphy: I was tempted to vote for my local "cannabis is safer than alcohol" party but I thought the logo (cannabis leaf) was a bit naff
07/05/2015, 08:34 - Angela: Eerily quiet at my polling station, I was the only one in there for a while.... #awkwardvoting
07/05/2015, 08:34 - Angela: Should I stay here for a while, read the whole list to make it seem like I'm thinking about it...?
07/05/2015, 08:35 - Shaggy: No it would look like you haven't given it thought before
07/05/2015, 08:36 - Angela: It's lose-lose for me really
07/05/2015, 08:37 - Angela: Can I get a veg now?!
07/05/2015, 08:38 - Owen: Vote tactically.
07/05/2015, 08:38 - Tegan: üçí

07/05/2015, 09:12 - Martha: I voted by postal vote - hoping what happened to Hannah last election doesn't happen to me.
07/05/2015, 09:13 - Angela: What happened
07/05/2015, 09:18 - Martha: Got a letter afterwards saying her vote didn't count because they didn't believe it was her
07/05/2015, 09:19 - Angela: That's so weird. Why wouldn't they?
07/05/2015, 09:22 - Martha: Dunno - signature looked a bit different maybe.
07/05/2015, 09:41 - Hannah Murphy: I'm creative with my signature every time it would seem
07/05/2015, 09:43 - Hannah Murphy: Don't be creative Martha!
07/05/2015, 09:43 - Angela: And yet you don't have to show ID when you go and vote...
07/05/2015, 09:45 - Tegan: Because you have an address! What greater measure is there??
07/05/2015, 10:48 - Tegan: veg!

07/05/2015, 12:23 - Owen: Henry you can be chief whip
07/05/2015, 12:42 - Mike SJ: Boris Johnson has 100/1 odds
07/05/2015, 12:42 - Mike SJ: That would be quite a coup
07/05/2015, 12:47 - Henry Dranks: Can I have an actual whip?
07/05/2015, 12:48 - Owen: That was my idea. I was going to dress you like indiana jones.

08/05/2015, 09:28 - Mike SJ: Who can replace him?
08/05/2015, 09:30 - Owen: It really probably doesn't make much difference. Milliband had bought into Cameron's cut everything rhetoric anyway,  so even if he got into power we'd still have a bunch of cuts.
08/05/2015, 09:32 - Martha: <Media omitted>
08/05/2015, 09:33 - Owen: We need someone like Tony Benn. What happened to politicians like him.
08/05/2015, 09:34 - Mike SJ: Owen, what Miliband rhetoric are you talking about?
08/05/2015, 09:35 - Owen: Cameron's cut everything rhetoric.
08/05/2015, 09:36 - Owen: Milliband bought into it. The debates between them were basically them just promising to cut everything except the NHS
08/05/2015, 09:36 - Owen: So if labour got in we'd also just have more "austerity"
08/05/2015, 09:43 - Mike SJ: He said that about 2015-2016 I think?
08/05/2015, 09:44 - Mike SJ: Nothing long term
08/05/2015, 09:44 - Mike SJ: Mad fact - UKIP got twice as many votes as SNP
08/05/2015, 09:44 - Mike SJ: 3 million people
08/05/2015, 09:45 - Owen: We really need PR. Even if it does mean UKIP get more seats, facts like that just make a mockery of our fptp system.

08/05/2015, 13:44 - Owen: That means 49% of areas happiness went down.
08/05/2015, 13:45 - Owen: It doesn't say how many showed no change.
08/05/2015, 13:45 - Owen: So it could be 0% happier, 51% no change, and 49% less happy.
08/05/2015, 13:45 - Owen: Fuck you independent!
08/05/2015, 13:47 - Joe Jarman: I don't think so, it doesn't factor in fear of Scottish people anywhere
08/05/2015, 13:51 - Jimena: Tough crowd üòû
08/05/2015, 13:51 - Owen: Sorry.
08/05/2015, 13:52 - Owen: The newspapers in general have been driving me nuts in the lead up to the election.
08/05/2015, 13:54 - Owen: As soon as election season happens, when the papera should try their best to be objective seems to be the time they decide to unashamedly just smear propaganda in your face. No wonder Cameron got a majority, all but one of the major newspapers explicitly supported him.
08/05/2015, 13:55 - Joe Jarman: I like your article jimena üòä
08/05/2015, 14:03 - Joe Jarman: I bet david likes it too üòç
08/05/2015, 14:05 - Hannah Murphy: Anybody looking for a Chinese man ticket?
08/05/2015, 14:15 - Jimena: Whatever political propaganda opportunities david or others see in it, it doesnt take away that it is nice to be right at the top of a list that includes 3 nordic countries and canada.
08/05/2015, 14:16 - Jimena: üá®üá≠hop suisse!
08/05/2015, 14:20 - Tegan: Well done Switzerland!
08/05/2015, 14:21 - Tegan: (Have that, Sweden!)
08/05/2015, 14:21 - Pete Morey: I gotta say,  I felt the classy civilisation seeping in to my grubby British pores when I visited ye Jim.  That and the cheese.
08/05/2015, 14:22 - Owen: I don't have a problem with a happiness report. Just the way the independent covered it.
08/05/2015, 14:22 - Tegan: cheese pores
08/05/2015, 14:22 - Tegan: mmmmmm
08/05/2015, 14:35 - Bongo: Hear hear Owen, shameless propaganda leading up to the election
08/05/2015, 14:35 - Bongo: Campaign adverts that imply things that completely contradict the party's policies
08/05/2015, 14:35 - Bongo: But it's always been like that
08/05/2015, 14:36 - Bongo: Political leaders are becoming like zaphod beeblebrox
08/05/2015, 14:38 - Owen: In America money wins elections, in Britain newspapers win elections. I'm not sure which I would prefer, but they are both shit.
08/05/2015, 14:44 - Pete Morey: This could be gd critical side-reading to the happiness report.  Ie Is it a good thing in itself to bring wellbeing into policy-tool territory,  where,  once it becomes measurable,  it becomes malleable both in a good and bad way...  (whatever 'it'  is) :

http://www.theguardian.com/media/2015/may/07/how-friendship-became-tool-of-powerful
08/05/2015, 14:58 - Owen: However it's used I would rather have a happiness number used to measure progress than the deficit.
08/05/2015, 15:13 - Pete Morey: Yeah me too!
08/05/2015, 15:26 - Martha: Unfortunately gdp and deficit tell the gov and its lenders how reliably it will be able to pay off its loans. If risk goes up the interest rate can go up or the number of investors can go down, likely leaving the government with less in its purse to spend on welfare services. So deficit and gdp have an indirect impact on progress in that way at least.
08/05/2015, 15:27 - Martha: But yes, if you want to measure actual progress and welfare you should look at another indicator, I'm just saying you can't disregard it completely.
08/05/2015, 15:29 - Tegan: Let's have lots of indicators
08/05/2015, 15:29 - Tegan: much more interesting modeling
08/05/2015, 15:30 - Pete Morey: :D
08/05/2015, 15:33 - Pete Morey: But highlighting the dangers/limits of wellbeing-as-economic-indicator seems important because it is the most easily co-opted (ie ppl can be duped into following the feel good factor more easily, by a political leader who may be pursuing a darker agenda).
08/05/2015, 15:36 - Steven: There are no academic studies to indicate a relationship between financial or media backing and election success. The money and media support flow to the people and parties most likely to win rather than the other way round. There are academic studies that show that relationship.
08/05/2015, 15:40 - Pete Morey: That's analogous to what the editor of the Sun said on TV yesterday about their editorial policy in Scotland and England. He seemed like quite a calm,  reasonable and balanced man compared to his headlines,  which somehow directly supported his general point.
08/05/2015, 15:41 - Lorna: I agree with your point about money and elections. But with papers I'm not so sure. Murdoch has it in for the labour party, and he controls the majority of the media.
08/05/2015, 15:43 - Lorna: ...of the papers anyway. The conservative campaign was strengthened by the argument that labour overspent and would put us back in a recession.
08/05/2015, 15:44 - Lorna: That has no factual basis, but it was what Murdoch was reporting. And people will be influenced by that
08/05/2015, 17:31 - Steven: This is the only paper I believe.

08/05/2015, 19:22 - Bongo: It works in small groups with common principles
08/05/2015, 19:23 - Bongo: Like the horde, can we just go live on a mountainside somewhere and leave all of this?
08/05/2015, 19:39 - Sam Trundell: Like Sweden
08/05/2015, 19:59 - Bongo: But we'll call it.. Bongdom
08/05/2015, 20:34 - Shaggy: Shangdom
08/05/2015, 21:35 - Alex Bunn: Got drunk. Am cycling home. A classic
09/05/2015, 21:46 - Shaggy: <Media omitted>
10/05/2015, 11:30 - Owen: Blargh guys, blargh.
10/05/2015, 11:30 - Owen: I do not remember last night.
10/05/2015, 11:31 - Owen: I think I was a bit of a buffoon though.
10/05/2015, 11:31 - Owen: Can anyone who was more sober than me offer any insight?
10/05/2015, 11:44 - Bongo: Lol you were just happy
10/05/2015, 11:44 - Bongo: No particular buffoonery
10/05/2015, 11:44 - Owen: I think I said some bad stuff.
10/05/2015, 11:44 - Bongo: You were very close to arguing with the bouncers for not being able to take our drink out of the club though
10/05/2015, 11:44 - Owen: Really?
10/05/2015, 11:45 - Bongo: Yea it's cool though I was just like "bad owen!"
10/05/2015, 11:45 - Owen: Oh god. Arguing with emptiers is never a good idea.
10/05/2015, 11:45 - Bongo: Haha yea
10/05/2015, 11:45 - Owen: Did I try kissing any of you. I think I was in a particularly kissy mood.
10/05/2015, 11:46 - Owen: ?
10/05/2015, 11:46 - Bongo: lol not me
10/05/2015, 11:48 - Owen: Did I reveal any personal information?
10/05/2015, 12:23 - Lora: Who loves discooooo? http://www.residentadvisor.net/event.aspx?709077
10/05/2015, 12:47 - Bongo: You did mention that one time you took it up the bum and liked it
10/05/2015, 12:47 - Bongo: Don't worry we won't tell Eliza
10/05/2015, 12:54 - Shaggy: Going to scruff the following night, so I'll probably miss the disco
10/05/2015, 13:05 - Mike SJ: Red Arrows fuck yeaaah Óîê

10/05/2015, 15:47 - Alex Bunn: I am here
10/05/2015, 16:03 - Mike SJ: Just in Sainsbury's
10/05/2015, 17:47 - Bongo: Wow, haven't been down brick lane in she's
10/05/2015, 17:48 - Bongo: *ages
10/05/2015, 17:48 - Bongo: Good to know it's still as barmey as always
10/05/2015, 17:48 - Tegan: That place be kray
10/05/2015, 17:50 - Bongo: I feel really under dressed
10/05/2015, 17:50 - Dave: walk on your hands
10/05/2015, 17:50 - Bongo: And outnumbered by selfie sticks
10/05/2015, 17:51 - Dave: Be ahead of the times - everyone will be doing it soon
10/05/2015, 17:51 - Bongo: Lol good call Dave
10/05/2015, 17:51 - Bongo: Wish I had thought of that
10/05/2015, 17:51 - Dave: That's why you have me
10/05/2015, 17:51 - Dave: *cries at the futility of life*

10/05/2015, 19:43 - Tegan: Sorry I missed the party y'all
10/05/2015, 19:43 - Tegan: Much love to Martita on her birthdita
10/05/2015, 19:44 - Tegan: (That's how girls have birthdays in Spanish)
10/05/2015, 19:44 - Tegan: x
10/05/2015, 19:44 - Owen: It sounds like you are calling Martha a tit.
10/05/2015, 20:07 - Hannah Murphy: Tegan - that photo of you bouncing!!!!
10/05/2015, 20:07 - Hannah Murphy: I think that's my favourite thing!!
10/05/2015, 20:08 - Owen: Hovering.
10/05/2015, 20:08 - Owen: Tegan doesn't bounce or jump, she hovers
10/05/2015, 20:32 - Mike SJ: She farted
11/05/2015, 05:56 - Tegan: it is an amazing thing
11/05/2015, 05:57 - Tegan: It is possible that I farted
11/05/2015, 10:40 - Bongo: Lol such a good photo
11/05/2015, 10:41 - Bongo: I wish I could guff into shot like that
11/05/2015, 10:44 - Owen: Should you write not applicable as "na" or "n/a"
11/05/2015, 10:45 - Owen: I see it written as "n/a" a lot. But that makes no sense as surely that means not/applicable
11/05/2015, 10:51 - Bongo: N/a, I know what you mean it should really be n.a.
11/05/2015, 10:52 - Bongo: Na just sounds like a colloquial no
11/05/2015, 10:52 - Bongo: Naaaaaaa I mean
11/05/2015, 10:53 - Owen: N/a is a tautology. Its either applicable or its not.
11/05/2015, 10:53 - Owen: üòÑ
11/05/2015, 10:53 - Owen: Not or applicable.
11/05/2015, 10:53 - Owen: ! ||==
11/05/2015, 10:53 - Owen: Lol nerd bants!
11/05/2015, 11:03 - Bongo: Wait I thought n/a is saying that it's definitely not applicable
11/05/2015, 11:05 - Owen: That's what it's meant to be.
11/05/2015, 11:05 - Owen: But the slash completely changes its meaning. A slash normally means or. E.g. Male/female.
11/05/2015, 11:06 - Owen: So n/a is almost like it's saying not or applicable, which is nonsense, or hilarious.
11/05/2015, 11:22 - Mike SJ: I sometimes write o/w and w/e for otherwise and whatever
11/05/2015, 11:22 - Shaggy: w/ means with, while w/o means without
11/05/2015, 11:25 - Owen: I have seen w/o i don't think I have seen w/
11/05/2015, 11:34 - Eliza: Slash doesn't always mean "or". It can just be used to separate first letters in abbreviations. E.g. n/a w/ w/r/t
11/05/2015, 11:40 - Owen: Thats silly, but I am pretty sure you are correct. I just didn't want to look like an idiot writing kids reports with n/a in them.
11/05/2015, 11:42 - Eliza: It's no sillier than 1/2 meaning half not 1 or 2. Slash can be different things.
11/05/2015, 11:44 - Bongo: Wo wo wo, fractions are a whole different ball game
11/05/2015, 11:45 - Owen: Oh I see n/a means "not divided by applicable"
11/05/2015, 11:45 - Eliza: Now you've got it!
11/05/2015, 11:45 - Bongo: Which in most cases is equal to 3
11/05/2015, 11:45 - Owen: Except in the case where it's not
11/05/2015, 11:48 - Pete Morey: <Media omitted>
11/05/2015, 11:49 - Owen: Haha, I love that cartoon.
11/05/2015, 11:50 - Bongo: Lol
11/05/2015, 11:55 - Owen: The only thing missing is that the plane then crashes into London killing thousands.
11/05/2015, 11:55 - Owen: Gove was worse than incompetent, he was anti-competent.
11/05/2015, 11:56 - Owen: If he was incompetent then nothing would have been done, he actively tried his best to put the education system back 20 years.
11/05/2015, 12:43 - Lorna: Which means that now he's minister for justice, they'll be hangings.
11/05/2015, 12:46 - Bongo: Is he? Ha
11/05/2015, 12:47 - Pete Morey: Yup: top priority for Gove= get rid of those pesky human rights
11/05/2015, 12:52 - Sam Trundell: Theresa May is already on it
11/05/2015, 12:56 - Martha: Thanks for yesterday guapos! Excellent video war. And cake. Excellent cake.
11/05/2015, 13:05 - Bongo: Cheers chica, awesome party
11/05/2015, 14:05 - Shaggy: Yeah why the hell is that about human rights?
11/05/2015, 14:57 - Dave: Hype?
11/05/2015, 14:58 - Sam Roberts: Hype!
11/05/2015, 14:59 - Shaggy: Hype¬°
11/05/2015, 15:12 - Joe Jarman: There's a bunch of lazy socialists lying around at home, hopefully they'll clean up before the providers get home and get those coals black lit!
11/05/2015, 15:15 - Mike SJ: I think Niall's getting well into it
11/05/2015, 15:15 - Mike SJ: He said he bought steaks and chicken wings

11/05/2015, 15:17 - Joe Jarman: Those chicken wings are worth their weight in gold! Gold I tell thee

11/05/2015, 18:14 - Bongo: Draboobs
11/05/2015, 18:50 - Shaggy: I prefer the term boogons
11/05/2015, 18:51 - Martha: Heading over now. Anyone there yet?
11/05/2015, 18:52 - Sam Roberts: As yis
11/05/2015, 18:52 - Sam Roberts: And ready chica
11/05/2015, 18:52 - Martha: Sheeeeeet. There as soon as my little legs can peddle me xx
11/05/2015, 18:55 - Pete Morey: Shhheeeiiittt...  Omw what times za shew?  Got jerk pork 4 grill
11/05/2015, 19:00 - Sam Roberts: Get over broskini
11/05/2015, 19:00 - Sam Roberts: Getting the grill on shortly, screening around 9.30?
11/05/2015, 19:01 - Pete Morey: Ah kwl,  late showing tonight.  What's a broskini?
11/05/2015, 19:02 - Joe Jarman: You handsome
11/05/2015, 19:02 - Joe Jarman: üòâ
11/05/2015, 19:03 - Pete Morey: :o
11/05/2015, 19:17 - Sam Roberts: Someone who isn't here grab some beers please
11/05/2015, 19:17 - Sam Roberts: After the ones we're drinking, and the ones we've got on backup, we're all out of beer
12/05/2015, 16:25 - Owen: Hi horde. Do any of your workplaces accept year 10 work experience students? Just a week, because the kids that need two weeks you probably wouldn't want. The ones that only need one week are all really nice kids though.
12/05/2015, 16:26 - Angela: Mine might
12/05/2015, 16:26 - Angela: We have post 6th form interns
12/05/2015, 16:26 - Angela: What do they want to do?
12/05/2015, 16:27 - Owen: The email didn't say, but if they have left it this late i think they'll be happy with anything.
12/05/2015, 16:28 - Owen: I think the idea is that it's shadowing some professional person.
12/05/2015, 16:30 - Angela: I think if they came here they'd probably be set some work to do rather than shadowing someone
12/05/2015, 16:30 - Eliza: I will take one small child to make me coffee and paint the kitchen please.
12/05/2015, 16:31 - Angela: But they would *see* professional people
12/05/2015, 17:41 - Shaggy: We don't do babysitting
12/05/2015, 17:43 - Hannah Murphy: I can babysit 10 kids if you pay me
12/05/2015, 17:43 - Hannah Murphy: ¬£20 an hour per kid
12/05/2015, 17:48 - Bongo: Can we get them to work on a new app?
12/05/2015, 17:49 - Bongo: What better work experience than to get them to all start their own company
12/05/2015, 18:06 - Owen: That's a pretty good idea, but I'm pretty sure the idea is that unless you go to private school you have to learn to serve others. Work experience is there to show kids not to aspire to capital and instead to resign themselves to the fact that their labour is owned by the bourgeoisie. The persuit of capital is only for posh people.
12/05/2015, 18:09 - Bongo: Lol that's dark dude
12/05/2015, 18:41 - Jimena: Hey Martyn, can I work on a new app üò¨
12/05/2015, 18:42 - Owen: You could design us a stamp set üòÑ
12/05/2015, 19:02 - Jimena: Me? Do u mean that in a techie way or normal cuz i actually have a stamp making set
12/05/2015, 19:04 - Jimena: <Media omitted>
12/05/2015, 19:04 - Jimena: Or u can just borrow some of these
12/05/2015, 19:04 - Jimena: <Media omitted>
12/05/2015, 19:05 - Vinay: ...
12/05/2015, 19:05 - Vinay: I want them
12/05/2015, 19:05 - Jimena: üòé
12/05/2015, 19:09 - Jimena: I also have TONS of stickers. Including glow in the dark and scratch and sniff ones.
12/05/2015, 19:09 - Bongo: Scratch and sniff!!
12/05/2015, 19:10 - Bongo: Man that brings me back, surely that's not still a thing,
12/05/2015, 19:11 - Vinay: Do you also have temporary tattoo stickers?
12/05/2015, 19:12 - Vinay: Never heard of/seen scratch and sniff...
12/05/2015, 19:13 - Jimena: What?! No scratch and sniff! Teachers used to put them on certificates and stuff when i was a wee lass
12/05/2015, 19:14 - Jimena: <Media omitted>
12/05/2015, 19:14 - Jimena: They smell like chocolate and other stuff
12/05/2015, 19:16 - Vinay: Cool..  So how do I get that racoon, tiger, and wing-eared koala stamp...
12/05/2015, 19:17 - Bongo: I had a peanut butter scratch and sniff that gradually started to smell like Tarmac
12/05/2015, 19:19 - Vinay: Lol
12/05/2015, 19:19 - Vinay: Tarmac doesn't smell that bad though
12/05/2015, 19:19 - Bongo: But it doesn't smell like peanut butter
12/05/2015, 19:20 - Vinay: Good point üòÖ
12/05/2015, 19:20 - Bongo: And so my childhood dreams of a constant supply of peanut butter smell were destroyed
12/05/2015, 19:26 - Owen: Jimena, has bongo not told you about our app.
12/05/2015, 19:27 - Bongo: I have
12/05/2015, 19:27 - Owen: It's that game where you fold paper into three then one person draws the head, one the body, one the legs then you open it out.
12/05/2015, 19:28 - Owen: We have added stanps sets so that people don't have to draw thier own eyes and stuff.
12/05/2015, 19:30 - Owen: That's what i was suggesting, you could choose a topic and then have your stamp set in the app, if you like that idea. If you want to get into the more technical side of it I could show you the Android end of it, im sure bongo would be willing to show you the Facebook end and if you ask nice Dan could show you the iOS side.
12/05/2015, 19:31 - Vinay: Bloody hell, another earthquake in Nepal apparently

13/05/2015, 13:43 - Dave: Thank god there is no Dan. It's too complicated with him in my life
13/05/2015, 13:45 - Sam Roberts: But the memories you might have had together!
13/05/2015, 13:45 - Sam Roberts: The stapling!

19/05/2015, 08:32 - Owen: Does anyone know any good pubs near kings cross?
19/05/2015, 08:34 - Alex Bunn: Good pubs near kings cross: big chill house
19/05/2015, 08:35 - Alex Bunn: The fellow
19/05/2015, 08:36 - Alex Bunn: I had my first cycle to work from the new house
19/05/2015, 08:36 - Alex Bunn: very underwhelming
19/05/2015, 08:37 - Alex Bunn: So short and so safe!
19/05/2015, 08:37 - Alex Bunn: Barely broke a sweat and didnt have any life threatening junctions to cross
19/05/2015, 08:37 - Alex Bunn: 2/10
19/05/2015, 08:40 - Owen: I was confused then, i thought "the new house" was a pub and you were rating said pub based of how hard a cycle to work is from it, which felt like a fairly arbitrary measure.
19/05/2015, 08:40 - Owen: Thanks for the suggestions.
19/05/2015, 08:58 - Mike SJ: @Bunn - take a detour and cycle round Bank/Monument for a bit
19/05/2015, 08:58 - Mike SJ: I think that's my nastiest/fav place to cycle
19/05/2015, 08:59 - Alex Bunn: Haha. Maybe i will!
19/05/2015, 09:00 - Dave: Owen, Central Station has free pool, cheap beer and a downstairs dungeon
19/05/2015, 09:02 - Dave: Simmons bar is nice but small - has good drinks offers til 8 or 9
19/05/2015, 09:03 - Owen: Dungeon? Like... Sex.. Dungeon...? My my Dave, I wouldn't have guessed!
19/05/2015, 09:03 - Dave: Backpackers is cheap, has a roof garden. Often friendly people there
19/05/2015, 09:04 - Dave: Ha, Sam knows more about what happens down there than me
19/05/2015, 09:05 - Shaggy: Premier in is cheap but not very atmospheric
19/05/2015, 09:07 - Owen: Is that a joke shaggy?
19/05/2015, 09:07 - Owen: I'm not taking a date to a premier inn!
19/05/2015, 09:07 - Owen: Well not immediately anyway üòâ
19/05/2015, 09:07 - Shaggy: That depends what the goal is
19/05/2015, 09:22 - Hannah Murphy: Bunn - please do not take cycling advice from Mike
19/05/2015, 09:22 - Hannah Murphy: Or do you wanna get all scarred up?
19/05/2015, 09:22 - Alex Bunn: Haha. But he rides to the Xtreme

19/05/2015, 09:45 - Mike SJ: Seriously, it's like Hercules blood in the sand
19/05/2015, 09:57 - Alex Bunn: I dont know what that is but i assume its shit
19/05/2015, 09:57 - Alex Bunn: People are slating that scene on the interwebs
19/05/2015, 10:00 - Joe Jarman: It was a bit comic really
19/05/2015, 10:00 - Alex Bunn: Cant wait to watch it again tho
19/05/2015, 10:07 - Mike SJ: I meant Spartacus woops

19/05/2015, 10:08 - Owen: Spoilers!
19/05/2015, 10:09 - Sam Roberts: There's a scene where a guys face gets cut off and his brain falls out
19/05/2015, 10:09 - Shaggy: Brain is attached to your spine
19/05/2015, 10:10 - Sam Roberts: Not this guy's
19/05/2015, 10:10 - Sam Roberts: Hey yeah we didn't decide a cinema
19/05/2015, 10:11 - Sam Roberts: Think richmix was the leader though

19/05/2015, 11:51 - Alex Bunn: I would but i think it might chuck it down later
19/05/2015, 11:51 - Alex Bunn: ‚òîÔ∏è
19/05/2015, 12:05 - Mike SJ: What are people thinking then?
19/05/2015, 12:05 - Mike SJ: Not gona hang around til 9 on my own!
19/05/2015, 12:22 - Alex Bunn: Tbh i'm out
19/05/2015, 12:22 - Tegan: Lize and I were saying we'd be up for it next week
19/05/2015, 12:23 - Tegan: This week is looking too busay
19/05/2015, 12:25 - Vanessa: Owen there's also Drink, Shop & Do at kings cross. It's not a pub but a nice place
19/05/2015, 12:30 - Dave: Just watched a UKIP MEP mess up his speech at the European Parliament.

He ended by saying "yes to the EU, no to the UK" then had to correct himself
19/05/2015, 12:31 - Dave: @owen and v - Hausmann's bookshop is also a great kings x shop.
19/05/2015, 12:35 - Owen: I think I agree with him.
19/05/2015, 12:35 - Owen: Let's start a no to the UK party, lets just become Europe already.
19/05/2015, 12:49 - Tegan: lol
19/05/2015, 12:49 - Tegan: I bet he was practising all the way there
19/05/2015, 12:49 - Tegan: 'no EU, yes UK
19/05/2015, 12:50 - Tegan: 'yes EU, no UK'
19/05/2015, 12:50 - Tegan: Dammit!
19/05/2015, 12:50 - Owen: Lol
19/05/2015, 12:53 - Owen: Did you know that the negative externalities and subsidies for fossil fuels equal 6.5% of the worlds GDP. The IMF just published a study, they also say they have probably underestimated because they only looked at directly attributable financially measurable externalities.
19/05/2015, 12:56 - Dave: What's the split between subsidies and externalities?
19/05/2015, 13:05 - Shaggy: I don't even know what externalities are
19/05/2015, 13:07 - Owen: <Media omitted>
19/05/2015, 13:07 - Owen: Here's the breakdown Dave.
19/05/2015, 13:07 - Owen: It's mainly externalities.
19/05/2015, 13:08 - Owen: The article did this annoying thing of calling them both subsidies, I guess because not everyone knows what a negative externality is.
19/05/2015, 13:09 - Owen: http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/may/18/fossil-fuel-companies-getting-10m-a-minute-in-subsidies-says-imf?CMP=fb_gu
19/05/2015, 13:09 - Owen: That's the article.
19/05/2015, 13:09 - Dave: @shaggy - Externalities are costs or benefits which are not accounted for in the market price of a good.
19/05/2015, 13:11 - Dave: So the polluting effect of a car would not usually factor into it's price but is a cost to the environment
19/05/2015, 13:11 - Dave: This cost can be internalised by adding a tax to the car in terms of how green it is
19/05/2015, 13:12 - Dave: Or alterntively it can be culturally internalised by making owning green cars desirable
19/05/2015, 13:45 - Owen: What's even crazier is that 6.5% figure comes without including global warming at all!
19/05/2015, 18:05 - Lorna: So who's coming to the cinema then? I'm heading to Shoreditch now
19/05/2015, 18:06 - Lorna: Or shall we go next week if people prefer?
19/05/2015, 18:13 - Sam Roberts: Uhhhhh
19/05/2015, 18:14 - Sam Roberts: Mike made me go to canary wharf
19/05/2015, 18:14 - Sam Roberts: Come to canary wharf? Just setting off now
19/05/2015, 18:15 - Lorna: Pssh. What time's the film there?
19/05/2015, 18:38 - Mike SJ: 8, sry thought no one was interested
19/05/2015, 18:43 - Sam Roberts: Just got to c&c, anyone want a pint?
19/05/2015, 18:58 - Lorna: Its too far to canary wharf, I'm out.
19/05/2015, 18:58 - Tegan: Bloody Mike
19/05/2015, 19:00 - Sam Roberts: Super quick from Shoreditch, overground to Canada water then 1 stop
19/05/2015, 19:00 - Sam Roberts: Come!
19/05/2015, 19:01 - Lorna: I'm at Finsbury park! Less quick, and I'm actually pretty tired.
19/05/2015, 19:02 - Lorna: Might just pirate it anyway, it's the mad Max way
19/05/2015, 19:05 - Alex Bunn: Haha
19/05/2015, 19:10 - Sam Trundell: I'm still in, where is c&c?
19/05/2015, 19:11 - Sam Roberts: Corney & Barrow Canary Wharf

19/05/2015, 19:59 - Sam Roberts: No way!
19/05/2015, 19:59 - Sam Roberts: I literally told mine not to bother getting tickets
19/05/2015, 20:00 - Sam Roberts: *Mike

20/05/2015, 11:19 - Krizia: los rudos vs los t√©cnicos with nortec collective (they are quite good)
20/05/2015, 11:20 - Shaggy: Woah ¬£50? Count me out
20/05/2015, 11:22 - Mike SJ: Yeah that sounds a bit serious!
20/05/2015, 11:26 - Owen: ¬£50! What is this wrestling in a pit of solid gold while having a solid gold back massage and solid gold breakfast lunch and dinner!
20/05/2015, 11:27 - Krizia: Is a gig though with Nortec Collective in Royal Albert Hall but really I'm not that fussed..
20/05/2015, 12:36 - Sam Roberts: So that's like real proper Mexicans doing the wrestling, but we'd have to sit still in seats and clap politely when they throw a midget out the ring
20/05/2015, 12:38 - Sam Roberts: Or! Lucha britannia with fake Mexicans, where we can hoot and holla all night, 19th June for ¬£15

20/05/2015, 12:59 - Tegan: curse them

20/05/2015, 13:12 - Tegan: Awesome
20/05/2015, 13:12 - Tegan: we can decide his backstory from a number of options by dice roll
20/05/2015, 13:13 - Shaggy: And use that drawing up to come up with the costume
20/05/2015, 13:13 - Shaggy: Drawing app
20/05/2015, 13:20 - Sam Roberts: I feel like enough tequila and we won't even need to sign him up
20/05/2015, 13:21 - Sam Roberts: Anyone feel like doing something a bit outdoorsy on Saturday? I'm thinking canoeing, outdoor climbing, cycling pub crawl, something like that?

20/05/2015, 18:49 - Owen: Did you look up, worst places in London to take a FIRST date to?
20/05/2015, 18:54 - Tegan: But a pint only costs 2.40 on a Monday!

20/05/2015, 20:28 - Owen: Pints are not cheap on a Wednesday.
20/05/2015, 20:29 - Dave: Dungeon
20/05/2015, 20:30 - Dave: üëª

21/05/2015, 16:21 - Mike SJ: Time to go home is a state of mind
21/05/2015, 16:21 - Mike SJ: You just have to believe it enough
21/05/2015, 16:37 - Tegan: unfortunately I took that attitude to 'time to go to work' this morning
21/05/2015, 16:37 - Tegan: So I might have to stay even longer
21/05/2015, 16:38 - Dave: Lol - too long watching the woodpecker
21/05/2015, 16:39 - Mike SJ: Is that what you call it? :b
21/05/2015, 16:48 - Dave: Too easy
21/05/2015, 16:52 - Mike SJ: I never noticed that word was two words for penis

21/05/2015, 18:01 - Owen: Is that hat a cycle helmet, because it doesn't look like it would work, in fact it looks like it would act like an egg slicer.

23/05/2015, 14:19 - Sam Roberts: Purple gown though
23/05/2015, 14:19 - Sam Roberts: Maybe taking the spirit of non commitment to it's logical conclusion

24/05/2015, 09:30 - Alex Bunn: Had to find elsewhere to crash
24/05/2015, 09:51 - Shaggy: To be fair you did something similar in c town - you didn't lock us out but we came home to you passed out on the couch and house full of smoke because you forgot about pasta which boiled out and completely burned.
24/05/2015, 09:52 - Shaggy: Luckily we didn't have any alarms or it could have woken you up. Smoke? Can sleep right through that shit
24/05/2015, 09:55 - Mike SJ: Haha

24/05/2015, 09:56 - Mike SJ: They were very not cool with that, had to sleep rough...
24/05/2015, 09:57 - Shaggy: I slept rough in Bristol once, those park benches aren't as comfy as one would think
24/05/2015, 10:01 - Lorna: Mike you also locked a cat in your room in Bristol once. Who was also not impressed
24/05/2015, 10:09 - Shaggy: Maybe mike thought that was his buds that came to visit
24/05/2015, 10:14 - Mike SJ: Holy shit I forgot about that lol
24/05/2015, 14:52 - Alex Bunn: We're pubbing

25/05/2015, 19:20 - Tegan: I guess I could lie down
25/05/2015, 19:28 - Joe Jarman: We still need firelighting liquid if anyone is close!!

25/05/2015, 21:38 - Joe Jarman: Give her one from us üòâ wheeeey
25/05/2015, 23:19 - Owen: Joe, we'd appreciate it if you saved your crass jokes where they belong, which is the opinion page of the sun newspaper.
25/05/2015, 23:23 - Joe Jarman: Sorry mate, alll bbqd up. Dear Deidre isn't what it used to be!
26/05/2015, 16:18 - Eliza: Owen says one of you (he can't remember who...) was saying something about some course in Greek myth...? What was this?
26/05/2015, 16:54 - Shaggy: Age of wonders II, I think it's on sale
26/05/2015, 16:57 - Owen: I'm not sure that was it... I swear someone was talking about some online course. I may have misunderstood though.
26/05/2015, 16:57 - Tegan: I think it was Sam
26/05/2015, 16:58 - Owen: I think it was too.
26/05/2015, 16:59 - Owen: @Sam, what was that greek myth thing you were talking about on sunday?
26/05/2015, 17:47 - Sam Roberts: Wasn't me on Sunday (out maybe it was, that was a large bottle of rum for one person)
26/05/2015, 17:48 - Sam Roberts: I sent it a message a little while back for an mitx online course on Greek myth and culture, I'll try and dig out the link but you can probably find it faster on the mitx or edx website
26/05/2015, 17:48 - Sam Roberts: I'm up for it if you fancy a study buddy
26/05/2015, 18:05 - Eliza: Ohh very maybe! I'll have a look, I just signed up for an online course on Film Noir as well - so I'll see how it works time wise...
26/05/2015, 18:41 - Eliza: The Ancient Greek hero? Or Greeks at war? Or Western Civilisation - ancient and medieval Europe? Is it one of those?
26/05/2015, 18:41 - Sam Roberts: Greek hero was the one I was looking at
26/05/2015, 18:41 - Sam Roberts: Open to whichever seems most badass though
26/05/2015, 18:42 - Eliza: Starting in September? Yes, I would be interested!
26/05/2015, 18:42 - Bongo: In myth or irl?
26/05/2015, 18:43 - Eliza: In epics and poems. Myth (mostly) I think.
26/05/2015, 18:45 - Bongo: What's that one with Eurydice?
26/05/2015, 18:45 - Bongo: That dude was a legend
26/05/2015, 18:45 - Bongo: And deserves a heavy metal theme tune for going to hell and back
26/05/2015, 18:47 - Eliza: The guy with the lyre? Yeah, he's cool. I think the course is mostly about The Iliad (Paris, Achilles, etc...) and Sapho's poems which I am not familiar with.
26/05/2015, 18:47 - Bongo: Orpheus
26/05/2015, 18:47 - Bongo: Is the guy
26/05/2015, 18:48 - Eliza: If anyone is interested in a course of film noir starting in June as well... http://www.openculture.com/2015/05/take-a-free-course-on-film-noir.html
26/05/2015, 18:49 - Eliza: Oh yeah, Orpheus was the guy, Eurydice was his lady love.
26/05/2015, 18:52 - Dan Sluckin: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_zLcaS76OtM
27/05/2015, 15:38 - Joe Jarman: Cinema 2 for 1 code if anyone wants it!
27/05/2015, 18:18 - Hannah Murphy: <Media omitted>
27/05/2015, 18:22 - Owen: Don't you legally have to offer tap water for free?
27/05/2015, 18:23 - Tegan: Cold, though
27/05/2015, 18:25 - Owen: Nice. I love cold things. Like winter and hearts.
27/05/2015, 18:29 - Hannah Murphy: Apparently it's just a tap with some cups
27/05/2015, 18:30 - Bongo: Lol that's so hipster
27/05/2015, 18:31 - Bongo: They probably have happy hour competitions to see who can drink their water the most ironically
27/05/2015, 18:32 - Bongo: And instead of a tv they just watch the local stray cat licking its balls
27/05/2015, 18:34 - Owen: Are you sure it's just tap water? It's not different types of mineral water or something?
27/05/2015, 18:53 - Vanessa: That would make more sense. water sommeliers actually exist
27/05/2015, 18:53 - Hannah Murphy: No I think it's some kind of thing for charity
27/05/2015, 18:53 - Hannah Murphy: To raise awareness of some water charity
27/05/2015, 18:57 - Hannah Murphy: On another note -government banning selling/manufacturing of all legal highs
27/05/2015, 18:58 - Hannah Murphy: Including laughing gas etcetc
27/05/2015, 18:58 - Hannah Murphy: That's a whole generation of 13 year olds won't get to try poppers
27/05/2015, 18:59 - Owen: What the hell do they count as a legal high?
27/05/2015, 18:59 - Shaggy: Laughing gas has a legitimate use though, what are they going to do about that?
27/05/2015, 18:59 - Owen: How will restaurants whip cream?
27/05/2015, 18:59 - Shaggy: Surely it doesn't include that
27/05/2015, 18:59 - Owen: And how will botanists feed thier plants?
27/05/2015, 19:00 - Shaggy: How will they feed their marijuana plants?
27/05/2015, 19:00 - Owen: Meow meow was sold as plant food.
27/05/2015, 19:02 - Shaggy: It was although it wasn't actually used for that purpose so we safely class it as a legal high
27/05/2015, 19:03 - Owen: Agreed, but how will the government know that the next plant food that gets released isn't a legal high?
27/05/2015, 19:06 - Shaggy: Well you could look at the chemical composition, so if it looks like MDMA, behaves like MDMA but is plant food then I'd argue it's probably not really plant food
27/05/2015, 19:08 - Shaggy: I would also argue that if we know that it's not plant food then so does the government
27/05/2015, 19:09 - Owen: Oh they would know, I'm just not sure how they legally prove it is.
27/05/2015, 19:47 - Mike SJ: Meh. Legal drugs. Meh.
27/05/2015, 19:47 - Mike SJ: The secret ingredient is crime anyway
27/05/2015, 19:48 - Dave: How about glue?
27/05/2015, 19:50 - Mike SJ: What about auto-asphyxiation?
27/05/2015, 19:50 - Shaggy: Only if it's erotic
27/05/2015, 19:52 - Owen: What about looking at the sun too long? Are the government gonna ban that too?
27/05/2015, 20:19 - Dave: Only for the poor
27/05/2015, 21:37 - Jimena: Btw: u guys heard about GoT: the musical? https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=RfI_mUIvYq8#
27/05/2015, 23:32 - Shaggy: Yes, it's great!
28/05/2015, 01:05 - Bongo: Heard it, amazing.
28/05/2015, 01:44 - Owen: Watching Dwyane "the rock" Johnson act is like watching Dwyane "a rock" Johnson act.
28/05/2015, 01:44 - Owen: Don't tell Phil I said that!
28/05/2015, 16:51 - Vanessa: Phah! Sepp Blatter says he's not responsible for the corruption. What a hoot
28/05/2015, 17:34 - Alex Bunn: Haha. He has to go!
28/05/2015, 17:36 - Alex Bunn: I think this corruption exposure is well timed considering he's put himself up for re-election despite promising he was gonna step down
28/05/2015, 17:36 - Alex Bunn: Its just a shame that Luis Figo dropped out of the presidential race
28/05/2015, 17:37 - Alex Bunn: Blatter wont fall on his sword tho
28/05/2015, 17:42 - Vanessa: I'm really hoping something good comes out of this. The U.S. is really taking this seriously and the change in legislation in Switzerland has enabled the Swiss authorities to actually act
29/05/2015, 14:34 - Mike SJ: http://www.zeit.de/sport/2015-05/sepp-blatter-all-reasons

29/05/2015, 14:57 - Shaggy: Sepp
29/05/2015, 15:01 - Mike SJ: I think it might be better for FIFA to collapse completely
29/05/2015, 15:02 - Mike SJ: Sepp winning would be conducive to that
29/05/2015, 16:34 - Dave: Anyone for a pint? I may leave work early
29/05/2015, 17:04 - Alex Bunn: Fitzrovia?
29/05/2015, 17:06 - Shaggy: I'm down for a pint
29/05/2015, 17:08 - Tegan: I'm on for about 6.30
29/05/2015, 17:28 - Dave: Frizrovia could work. Ibwas thinking kings x
29/05/2015, 17:31 - Dave: I'm gonna head to King's x. Hope that suits peeps
29/05/2015, 17:37 - Shaggy: Going to have a couple near work, will see how it goes after
29/05/2015, 18:19 - Owen: <Media omitted>
29/05/2015, 18:28 - Tegan: I think gyms are safe
29/05/2015, 18:29 - Tegan: similar effect could be attained with a marker pen, and it would be much more portable
29/05/2015, 18:44 - Vinay: Haha that's brilliant

01/06/2015, 10:14 - Krizia: Like 3 whole days and I still have nightmares!!!
01/06/2015, 10:18 - Tegan: I'm spending the next hour planning annual leave and fantasising about holiday

01/06/2015, 11:33 - Alex Bunn: He must battle in Daznak pit and continue to woop ass
01/06/2015, 11:38 - Owen: I bet Jorah becomes a stone man then kills denerys, its exactly the kind of thing grrrrrr martin would do for no good reason other than to toy with us. "Oh you were enjoying a character arc, fuck you reader!"
01/06/2015, 11:46 - Alex Bunn: We're ahead of the books on that arc üòú

05/06/2015, 07:35 - Jimena: Its a super racist nationalist party
05/06/2015, 07:37 - Jimena: The funny thing with the last poster is that the supposed ivan is actually a swiss guy, not a known rapist and they took his photo from the internet without asking
05/06/2015, 07:38 - Alex Bunn: Third guy is a jew
05/06/2015, 07:38 - Shaggy: You mean Israeli, yes that's possible

05/06/2015, 10:50 - Jimena: Where is he from?
05/06/2015, 10:50 - Jimena: Awesome hair and moustache
05/06/2015, 11:06 - Owen: <Media omitted>
05/06/2015, 11:08 - Hannah Murphy: OMg shaggy so that's what you were trying to do with that moustache last Christmas
05/06/2015, 11:09 - Shaggy: Trying? I nailed it
05/06/2015, 11:09 - Hannah Murphy: Well done you for trying
05/06/2015, 11:12 - Mike SJ: Haha, burn
05/06/2015, 11:13 - Mike SJ: He looks like a character from Asterix
05/06/2015, 11:13 - Shaggy: That's your authentic Ukrainian Cossack, not some stupid gall
05/06/2015, 11:13 - Shaggy: Gaul
05/06/2015, 11:16 - Dave: <Media omitted>
05/06/2015, 11:27 - Mike SJ: What stereotype is that?
05/06/2015, 11:27 - Mike SJ: Tegan, you'd better not be on the egg council
05/06/2015, 11:27 - Mike SJ: <Media omitted>
05/06/2015, 11:27 - Mike SJ: <Media omitted>
05/06/2015, 11:53 - Dave: Sorry, misunderstood the brief. I guess when i saw shaggys picture i took the idea to be how you would best represent your soul. Ergo egg.
05/06/2015, 11:57 - Tegan: xx
05/06/2015, 11:59 - Shaggy: I think restaurants should reward wastelessness (let's assume it's a word) by giving discounts to customers who finish their food. Or vice versa, penalise those who waste it
05/06/2015, 12:00 - Tegan: I think restaursnts should offer smaller portions and then the possibility of seconds
05/06/2015, 12:01 - Angela: We could ponder over the seconds menu
05/06/2015, 12:01 - Angela: And then decide we'd better not
05/06/2015, 12:01 - Shaggy: Also good
05/06/2015, 12:01 - Tegan: Would be great!
05/06/2015, 12:02 - Tegan: or charge the same price for a smaller meal with optional seconds
05/06/2015, 12:02 - Tegan: You know, for boys
05/06/2015, 12:03 - Dave: That's something i could get behind. Double dinner!
05/06/2015, 12:03 - Dave: üåΩ then üçÜ
05/06/2015, 12:03 - Vanessa: That's what doggy bags are for, to not waste your food
05/06/2015, 12:03 - Tegan: üåµ
05/06/2015, 12:03 - Tegan: You just reminded me I have pizza in the fridge!
05/06/2015, 12:04 - Tegan: Oh happy day!
05/06/2015, 12:04 - Angela: Ooh seconds in a doggy bag would be great!
05/06/2015, 12:04 - Vanessa: Maybe it's not practiced much  here
05/06/2015, 12:04 - Angela: Would avoid that problem of already having eaten all the best bits
05/06/2015, 12:04 - Tegan: Some places not others
05/06/2015, 12:04 - Tegan: true
05/06/2015, 12:04 - Dave: üçïwin
05/06/2015, 12:04 - Mike SJ: Why's it called a doggy bag?
05/06/2015, 12:05 - Angela: Maybe some people give it to the dog?
05/06/2015, 12:08 - Shaggy: They are not compulsory. I'm not worried about me wasting food, it's others
05/06/2015, 12:09 - Owen: Restaurants should just have a pit of lizards out back and then throw scraps to said lizards.
05/06/2015, 12:09 - Owen: You could also throw unruly customers into said pit.
05/06/2015, 12:09 - Angela: Maybe there could be doggy bagging rights at restaurants - if you see a plate of unfinished food from another table you should be able to claim it
05/06/2015, 12:09 - Shaggy: That's again, wasteful
05/06/2015, 12:10 - Owen: Not if you one day ride the lizards into battle
05/06/2015, 12:10 - Shaggy: What about cooties? That's unsanitary
05/06/2015, 12:10 - Dave: Yes Angie. I always want to finish food on other tables but tegan says it's not the done thing
05/06/2015, 12:10 - Angela: Let's start a campaign!
05/06/2015, 12:10 - Shaggy: Doggy and bagging. Are we still talking about food?
05/06/2015, 12:11 - Angela: Campaign for doggy bagging
05/06/2015, 12:11 - Dave: I remember spending a long 10 mins staring at someone's uneaten chunky chips in a pub debating whether i could take them
05/06/2015, 12:11 - Dave: Sadly i did not
05/06/2015, 12:11 - Dave: A decision is regret to this day
05/06/2015, 12:12 - Angela: You should carry around some Tupperware. Once it's in your Tupperware all cooties disappear and that's science
05/06/2015, 12:12 - Mike SJ: Surely you can only get a doggy bag if you already bought food
05/06/2015, 12:12 - Mike SJ: Otherwise that's bad business
05/06/2015, 12:13 - Shaggy: Nah I think that's fair too
05/06/2015, 12:13 - Shaggy: I like what pret do, I just wish they didn't brag about it so much
05/06/2015, 12:13 - Angela: Just because I've bought food, doesn't stop me wanting to eat everyone else's food
05/06/2015, 12:13 - Dave: You could pay for the right to take others food. It's like a buffet of other people's food.
05/06/2015, 12:13 - Shaggy: But mega cheap
05/06/2015, 12:13 - Mike SJ: Yeah but if you haven't bought food you can't take someone elses
05/06/2015, 12:14 - Shaggy: Cos otherwise it goes to ducking lizards
05/06/2015, 12:14 - Tegan: in other countries, they take food you haven't eaten (breads etc) and put it straight on other people's tables
05/06/2015, 12:15 - Tegan: of course, instances of vommunicable disease are much higher in those countries. ..
05/06/2015, 12:15 - Tegan: lol
05/06/2015, 12:15 - Mike SJ: Lol
05/06/2015, 12:15 - Tegan: communicable
05/06/2015, 12:15 - Shaggy: I think we should collectively start a restaurant of international food, where all waiters are stereotypes and then we can test these ideas. We can even get a lizard pit
05/06/2015, 12:15 - Angela: Lol diseases
05/06/2015, 12:17 - Owen: Yay! Lizard pit! I'm in. We just need to choose who to ride them into battle against.
05/06/2015, 12:18 - Shaggy: I think first candidate is Tegan, mostly due to size
05/06/2015, 12:18 - Shaggy: Or maybe Peter dinklage
05/06/2015, 12:19 - Owen: No no no, I meant who do we attack, not who rides the lizards. Obviously Tegan and Eliza and V ride the lizards
05/06/2015, 12:20 - Shaggy: Oh sorry, misread
05/06/2015, 12:20 - Tegan: lol
05/06/2015, 12:20 - Tegan: me and Peter dinklage
05/06/2015, 12:21 - Shaggy: Well, are they nuclear lizards? Maybe Putin?
05/06/2015, 12:21 - Owen: They are not nuclear lizards, unless litvinyenko visits our restaurant and his scraps get fed to the lizards.
05/06/2015, 12:22 - Shaggy: I don't want that kind of clientele, that's my one veto
05/06/2015, 12:23 - Owen: But assassinations are good for business.
05/06/2015, 12:23 - Owen: As are lizards.
05/06/2015, 12:24 - Shaggy: Assassinations leave at least one less person to pay
05/06/2015, 12:24 - Owen: Oh they pay alright!
05/06/2015, 12:24 - Angela: I'm not sure lizards would attack Putin. He is one of them
05/06/2015, 12:24 - Owen: Pay with their lives!
05/06/2015, 12:24 - Shaggy: You grow the lizards but that's not the primary business model
05/06/2015, 12:24 - Owen: Whaaa??
05/06/2015, 12:25 - Shaggy: Lizards aren't that discriminatory
05/06/2015, 12:25 - Shaggy: Step 3 is profit, not global domination
05/06/2015, 12:25 - Owen: Are we not running a shady lizard farm, did I miss something?
05/06/2015, 12:25 - Owen: Wow wow wow, wait.
05/06/2015, 12:25 - Angela: http://www.google.co.uk/imgres?imgurl=https://threehundredsixtyfivethousand.files.wordpress.com/2014/01/7.jpg&imgrefurl=https://threehundredsixtyfivethousand.wordpress.com/2014/01/07/7-lizard-people-putin-fevers-and-what-not/&h=545&w=673&tbnid=p5er_2faUeI7UM:&zoom=1&docid=zXBXkdfmpW_paM&hl=en-GB&ei=JodxVfPHFK_Y7AaC64CgAg&tbm=isch&ved=0CB4QMygAMAA
05/06/2015, 12:25 - Owen: You are not dreaming big enough dear boy.
05/06/2015, 12:26 - Shaggy: I have humble aspirations
05/06/2015, 12:26 - Shaggy: I want a restaurant where people don't waste food
05/06/2015, 12:27 - Shaggy: That's a good picture but you get a down vote for using a link
05/06/2015, 12:28 - Angela: www.kissmyass.com
05/06/2015, 12:28 - Owen: I wish wassap did have up and downvotes. I would have so many downvotes for derailing conversations by ranting about lizards!
05/06/2015, 12:30 - Shaggy: If a bear and a lizard had a child, it would be Owens wet dream
05/06/2015, 12:30 - Mike SJ: A blizzard
05/06/2015, 12:31 - Shaggy: Man I can't believe I missed that
05/06/2015, 12:31 - Owen: Oh my

05/06/2015, 15:07 - Owen: That's out of the box thinking.
05/06/2015, 15:08 - Owen: Airlines hate him. You won't believe this one trick a student used to save money on his flights.
05/06/2015, 15:30 - Mike SJ: Did you see that story about the dude offering a free round the world trip to any woman with the same name as his ex?
05/06/2015, 16:35 - Dave: Yeah. They had a good time apparently.
05/06/2015, 16:35 - Dave: But no schnarf

08/06/2015, 16:49 - Sam Roberts: Any preferred size? What about those ginger wine bottles?
08/06/2015, 16:52 - Lorna: No they need caps. 500ml is good. Reckon I only need about 4 litres, so should be easy.
08/06/2015, 17:02 - Martha: Yessir Dave!

12/06/2015, 05:57 - Adam Wills: It's great to see you're getting into football Dave!
12/06/2015, 05:58 - Adam Wills: From what text is included in the picture it looks like Rio Ferdinand is getting 'semi-bookended'... With 'text-book skill'
12/06/2015, 05:58 - Adam Wills: Urban dictionary defines bookended as 'When, while sitting at a bar, a person is flanked on either side by individuals who have chosen to take out books and read rather than continue a conversation. Also known as a Bilateral Booking.'
12/06/2015, 05:59 - Adam Wills: ... I guess the mystery continues
12/06/2015, 06:00 - Adam Wills: Unless Rio has hiding sought after paperbacks up his hidey
12/06/2015, 07:00 - Tegan: lol

12/06/2015, 10:50 - Mike Joyce: I think perhaps he is inserting the onion /lemon....so he doesn't dry up during the match
12/06/2015, 10:58 - Tegan: lol
12/06/2015, 10:58 - Tegan: striker basting

12/06/2015, 19:13 - Alex Bunn: If only free beer

12/06/2015, 21:20 - Mike SJ: I'm gona walk to Hackney Central
12/06/2015, 21:38 - Vanessa: We're on our way. Should get to Dalston kingsland in 45 min

12/06/2015, 22:25 - Alex Bunn: Ridley Road Market Bar (Wu's)
49 Ridley Rd, Dalston, Greater London E8 2NP

12/06/2015, 22:25 - Alex Bunn: Bam
12/06/2015, 22:25 - Alex Bunn: We're in Dalston
12/06/2015, 22:25 - Alex Bunn: Here
12/06/2015, 22:27 - Vanessa: It feels like a Caribbean beach bar without the sand
12/06/2015, 23:04 - Dave: Just read all this - I'd ve amazed if anyone meets anyone tonight at this rate
13/06/2015, 00:15 - Mike SJ: It was a shambles
13/06/2015, 10:36 - Shaggy: Spinoza sounds a great guy
13/06/2015, 14:09 - Sam Roberts: Why?
13/06/2015, 14:09 - Sam Roberts: The philosopher?
13/06/2015, 14:09 - Sam Roberts: Which one was Spinoza?
13/06/2015, 14:10 - Dave: Some rationalist
13/06/2015, 14:11 - Sam Roberts: He destroyed medieval ethics apparently
13/06/2015, 14:11 - Sam Roberts: And had a pretty sweet hat
13/06/2015, 14:11 - Sam Roberts: Hey who got to Dalston yesterday¬ø
13/06/2015, 14:16 - Shaggy: He tried to rationalise religion, did pretty well in my opinion, although his rabbis wouldn't agree
13/06/2015, 14:16 - Sam Roberts: Then I disagree with his whole project
13/06/2015, 14:16 - Sam Roberts: That's like rationalizing art
13/06/2015, 14:16 - Sam Roberts: You can reach a conclusion, but you've lost the essence of the subject by the time you get there
13/06/2015, 14:21 - Shaggy: Art fart
13/06/2015, 14:51 - Dave: Just been reading hus wiki page with Tegs. Seems a nice phikosophy. He's similar to Berkeley in his view of God. He sees thought and substance as being interacting and is against descartes in thinking them different. He doesn't belive in free will and is similar to the Stoics.
13/06/2015, 15:41 - Dave: üí©
13/06/2015, 15:48 - Mike SJ: Lol
13/06/2015, 15:50 - Mike SJ: Philosophy bants

13/06/2015, 16:14 - Mike SJ: How did the Solipsist break up with his girlfriend?
13/06/2015, 16:38 - Owen: He doesn't have to. He just stops thinking about her?
13/06/2015, 16:39 - Mike SJ: 'It's not you it's me'
13/06/2015, 16:40 - Owen: Hahah
13/06/2015, 22:02 - Dave: <Media omitted>
13/06/2015, 22:12 - Alex Bunn: Lol
13/06/2015, 22:34 - Shaggy: <Media omitted>
13/06/2015, 22:36 - Mike SJ: I still think it was my idea
13/06/2015, 23:50 - Alex Bunn: How on earth did you manage that?!?
13/06/2015, 23:50 - Alex Bunn: Jokes
14/06/2015, 01:35 - Mike SJ: We had a dream
14/06/2015, 07:46 - Adam Wills: This is amazing
14/06/2015, 07:46 - Adam Wills: FP shaggy and mike
14/06/2015, 17:36 - Alex Bunn: Do films get cheaper if they've been in the cinema for a long time?
14/06/2015, 17:37 - Alex Bunn: I think that should be a thing
14/06/2015, 17:42 - Bongo: Nah don't think so, they're only cheaper if they're crap
14/06/2015, 17:43 - Alex Bunn: I think they might make more money if they got a bit cheaper once their popularity starts to drop
14/06/2015, 17:45 - Mike SJ: Planet money did an episode about variable ticket pricing
14/06/2015, 17:46 - Mike SJ: I remember they made convincing arguments about why they don't, and I don't remember any of them
14/06/2015, 17:46 - Alex Bunn: Whats planet money?
14/06/2015, 17:46 - Sam Roberts: Haha I was thinking the same
14/06/2015, 17:47 - Sam Roberts: Maybe that it forces people to wait for the good rate?
14/06/2015, 17:47 - Mike SJ: http://www.npr.org/sections/money/2014/07/11/330680385/episode-552-blockbusters-bombs-and-the-price-of-a-ticket
14/06/2015, 17:48 - Mike SJ: Not quite the same as your idea, but same principle
14/06/2015, 17:56 - Owen: I was thinking exactly the same thing mike. Including the "I can't remember any of the conclusions" bit.
14/06/2015, 17:57 - Owen: If I remember the show was more about why blockbusters don't cost more than indie films.
14/06/2015, 17:58 - Owen: And if I remember correctly it's because the studios don't let it happen.
14/06/2015, 18:20 - Bongo: Charging less for how long it's been out would be admitting that it's value deteriorates over time which is probably only true just after release but it would make it seem that way past the release
14/06/2015, 18:20 - Bongo: So they probably just want to market it as "all of our movies are timeless"
14/06/2015, 18:21 - Bongo: Also it might convince people who were already going to see it straight away that they should wait until it gets cheaper
14/06/2015, 18:23 - Alex Bunn: Btw my housemates say the new jurassic world film is cheesy awesomeness to the max
14/06/2015, 18:23 - Mike SJ: Yeah I wana see it
14/06/2015, 18:23 - Sam Roberts: Is it out? Thought it was next month?
14/06/2015, 18:24 - Mike SJ: Nah it's out
14/06/2015, 18:24 - Owen: I'm seeing it in IMAX next Saturday!!
14/06/2015, 18:25 - Dave: I'd be up for a mid week film if anyone else is
14/06/2015, 18:37 - Dave: <Media omitted>
14/06/2015, 18:40 - Tegan: well, there are a lot of barbers
14/06/2015, 18:40 - Tegan: I guess you have to differentiate yourself
14/06/2015, 18:43 - Lorna: The Jurassic park film is supposed to be basically an inferior copy of the first one.
14/06/2015, 18:44 - Bongo: That would still make it better than any of the sequels
14/06/2015, 18:44 - Dave: Beat me to it!
14/06/2015, 18:44 - Bongo: They're.. They're.. They're learning
14/06/2015, 18:44 - Angela: I went to see it today, it's extremely silly but quite enjoyable
14/06/2015, 18:45 - Tegan: had it got any real fictional science in it?
14/06/2015, 18:45 - Angela: Some mega cheesy scenes, yup some real fictional science, a wobbly DNA character
14/06/2015, 18:45 - Angela: Keeps
14/06/2015, 18:45 - Angela: Jeeps
14/06/2015, 18:46 - Angela: It has it all
14/06/2015, 18:46 - Tegan: You know, like when the sharks got smarter, or when the scientists discovered green?
14/06/2015, 18:46 - Tegan: awesome to the max
14/06/2015, 18:47 - Angela: Nobody gives a shit about archeologists any more though, that's old hat
14/06/2015, 18:47 - Angela: It's all about snazzy geneticists
14/06/2015, 18:47 - Bongo: Does it have a scene where they hack into the mainframe to save the day?
14/06/2015, 18:48 - Tegan: The dna mainframe...
14/06/2015, 18:48 - Bongo: By a girl who learnt how to hack from Microsoft excel 2000 training
14/06/2015, 18:48 - Tegan: yeah!
14/06/2015, 18:48 - Angela: I can't confirm or deny those rumours. It might spoil the incredible suspense and uncertainty about the outcome
14/06/2015, 18:49 - Lorna: Jurassic park trivia: when Dr Grant gets on the helicopter and has two female ends of his seatbelt, he ties them together. This is a metaphor for how NATURE FINDS A WAY
14/06/2015, 18:49 - Angela: mind. Blown.
14/06/2015, 18:49 - Shaggy: Actually the hacking scene is pretty much the only example that is feasible and uses real existing tools
14/06/2015, 18:50 - Tegan: and a potent reminder that you should never shake with a lizard
14/06/2015, 18:50 - Tegan: lest you change its sex
14/06/2015, 18:55 - Tegan: No niche mighty bosh radio fans in the house then
14/06/2015, 18:55 - Tegan: k
14/06/2015, 18:55 - Angela: There needs to be a tumbleweed emoji
14/06/2015, 19:14 - Bongo: Lol that's not nature finding a way, that's man making the most of a situation when he's inbetween two female parts
14/06/2015, 21:55 - Owen: http://imgur.com/Xsu770n
14/06/2015, 22:04 - Bongo: Amazing! I always like to think animals are way more intelligent than us and that they're just putting on a show for us every time we try to document them so see how far they get make us believe is silly things
14/06/2015, 22:04 - Bongo: So many typos, I give up

15/06/2015, 12:00 - Alex Bunn: He can fucking freeze to death in the most anticlimactic last episode
15/06/2015, 12:00 - Mike SJ: #teamwhitewalkers
15/06/2015, 12:00 - Shaggy: Just cause you can't tan
15/06/2015, 12:02 - Mike SJ: I don't get why anyone was surprised about stannis
15/06/2015, 12:02 - Mike SJ: This is how he's acted the whole show
15/06/2015, 12:03 - Alex Bunn: But he did the speech
15/06/2015, 12:03 - Alex Bunn: About the princess
15/06/2015, 12:03 - Alex Bunn: With the awkward reluctant hug
15/06/2015, 12:03 - Sam Roberts: <Media omitted>
15/06/2015, 12:04 - Alex Bunn: Maybe they needed to play up his desperation a bit more rather than his fatherly qualities
15/06/2015, 12:04 - Alex Bunn: Good image sam!
15/06/2015, 12:13 - Mike SJ: Stannis shouldn't have shot his load on his brother, so to speak
15/06/2015, 12:14 - Mike SJ: Should have saved that shadow thing for the end boss, probly danaerys at this rate
15/06/2015, 12:24 - Alex Bunn: He just wanted to bang the red priestess
15/06/2015, 12:25 - Alex Bunn: Shadow baby assassin = fortunate result
15/06/2015, 12:26 - Mike SJ: Such a lad
15/06/2015, 13:33 - Tegan: totally unhyped to miss last big meat Monday :(

15/06/2015, 13:40 - Tegan: Then sri lanka
15/06/2015, 13:41 - Sam Roberts: Hmm you might want to leave the horde for a couple of days
15/06/2015, 13:41 - Sam Roberts: I promise I won't spoiler, but drunk Sam promises nothing
15/06/2015, 13:43 - Joe Jarman: JOoooooohhhhhnnmm snnnOOoOOOh
15/06/2015, 13:44 - Joe Jarman: watch teegz downloooad it
15/06/2015, 14:08 - Owen: Is that a canal bridge over a river? How quaint!
15/06/2015, 14:23 - Tegan: We'll see what the remote hotel wifi can do
15/06/2015, 14:23 - Tegan: I'll try to join you in spirit
15/06/2015, 14:39 - Tegan: Pretty quaint
15/06/2015, 14:39 - Tegan: Some sizeable bats flappin about
15/06/2015, 14:52 - Owen: Bats! Jewels!
15/06/2015, 19:26 - Dave: Can someone bring cooking oil
15/06/2015, 23:15 - Dave: Horde! No talking about GoT.
15/06/2015, 23:15 - Dave: Just saying now.
15/06/2015, 23:15 - Mike SJ: I called it.
15/06/2015, 23:15 - Mike SJ: Let it be known.

16/06/2015, 04:01 - Tegan: nice :)
16/06/2015, 08:21 - Bongo: Not a huge fan of that last episode
16/06/2015, 08:21 - Bongo: Oh wait I'll shut up if people haven't seen it yet
16/06/2015, 08:25 - Owen: I can't believe that dynaruas shacked up with tommen!!!!
16/06/2015, 08:26 - Owen: It makes no sense. It sounds like I made it up!
16/06/2015, 08:26 - Bongo: All I'll say is, king Geoffrey coming back as a zombie was a bit of a shocker
16/06/2015, 08:34 - Alex Bunn: Joffrey*
16/06/2015, 08:36 - Bongo: No I mean the other king, king Geoffrey
16/06/2015, 08:37 - Bongo: <Media omitted>
16/06/2015, 08:38 - Bongo: When we found out one of the dragons was hitler my mind was blown
16/06/2015, 08:46 - Owen: Stanos was a ice giant all along.
16/06/2015, 08:47 - Owen: ANd JaN snooo was a figment or a pirate's imagination.
16/06/2015, 08:52 - Owen: But in all seriousness: heavy metal poisoning was a bit of a lame way to kill off all the main characters. Did the show get cancelled suddenly and the writers had to come up with something in the spur of the moment?
16/06/2015, 09:29 - Mike SJ: What's the next hype train then?
16/06/2015, 09:29 - Mike SJ: True detective? Rick and Morty?
16/06/2015, 09:30 - Lorna: True detective!
16/06/2015, 09:34 - Owen: True detecorv!
16/06/2015, 09:58 - Owen: Gah, I hate teaching hungover.
16/06/2015, 10:15 - Dave: True detective, fo sho
16/06/2015, 10:18 - Mike SJ: I dunno, bit apprehensive about true detective
16/06/2015, 10:19 - Mike SJ: Rick and Morty I am thoroughly psyched for
16/06/2015, 10:19 - Dave: Sames - but equally i trust them to do the right thing
16/06/2015, 21:59 - Dave: Sup c town. When y'all home?x
16/06/2015, 22:04 - Sam Roberts: Ok, Mike n Joe, when are you back?
16/06/2015, 22:04 - Sam Roberts: I can be home in like 45 minutes I guess
16/06/2015, 22:15 - Dave: No need sam, I'm chilling with cate in a park so happy to wait

07/07/2015, 16:37 - Joe Jarman: Friday night

08/07/2015, 18:24 - Bongo: <Media omitted>
08/07/2015, 18:24 - Bongo: Elephant protesters in elephant and castle shopping centre
08/07/2015, 18:24 - Bongo: Blaring out elephant sounds at max volume
08/07/2015, 18:41 - Owen: What are they protesting. The existence of elephants?
08/07/2015, 18:42 - Dan Sluckin: are they pro- or anti- elephant?
08/07/2015, 18:44 - Owen: They think that all phant based creatures should be elephants.
08/07/2015, 19:14 - Bongo: They're protesting the demolition of the shopping mall
08/07/2015, 19:15 - Henry Dranks: why? it's a fucking shit hole
08/07/2015, 19:15 - Bongo: I think it's like a historical landmark or something
08/07/2015, 19:15 - Henry Dranks: I have to go thru that place twice a day and its my most hated place in london
08/07/2015, 19:15 - Mike Joyce: Burn it to the ground!!
08/07/2015, 19:15 - Bongo: You go through the shopping centre twice a day?!
08/07/2015, 19:15 - Alex Bunn: It is shit
08/07/2015, 19:15 - Bongo: It is a shithole agreed
08/07/2015, 19:15 - Henry Dranks: yea switch  over on commute
08/07/2015, 19:15 - Mike Joyce: He works in scoop and save
08/07/2015, 19:16 - Bongo: But I can understand people having irrational emotional feelings for it
08/07/2015, 19:17 - Shaggy: It's more the fact that people who live here are being squeezed out, into an even worse shithole somewhere else
08/07/2015, 19:18 - Mike SJ: In before: canning town
08/07/2015, 19:19 - Mike Joyce: Danny you irrational emotions!!
08/07/2015, 19:19 - Mike Joyce: *damn
08/07/2015, 19:19 - Bongo: It's a weird protest though, the elephant masks are like 3/10
08/07/2015, 19:20 - Bongo: The elephant sounds are cool though, very Jurassic park-esque
08/07/2015, 19:20 - Mike Joyce: Shittest of holes
08/07/2015, 19:20 - Dan Sluckin: so, did the Castle people not turn up?
08/07/2015, 19:23 - Bongo: I saw a huge down the road wearing a castle costume, but he used real bricks so he's taking ages to get there
08/07/2015, 19:23 - Bongo: Also, he won't be able to fit past the shopping centre doors
08/07/2015, 19:25 - Dan Sluckin: I suppose he's also quite susceptible to siege weapons
08/07/2015, 19:25 - Mike Joyce: You have to be built like a brick shot house to mannage....then it defeats the point
08/07/2015, 19:25 - Mike Joyce: *shit
08/07/2015, 19:25 - Bongo: Nice
08/07/2015, 19:26 - Mike Joyce: People would keep trying to do toilet in you
08/07/2015, 19:27 - Shaggy: At least he's wise on the three piggies story
08/07/2015, 19:27 - Mike Joyce: Ver true
08/07/2015, 19:28 - Mike Joyce: Bad swimming costume however
08/07/2015, 19:28 - Shaggy: Unless you're planning to swim with the fishes
08/07/2015, 19:29 - Mike Joyce: ...forevers
08/07/2015, 19:31 - Bongo: We need to do another fancy dress rave
08/07/2015, 19:34 - Owen: You know that the t rex roar in jp actually has an elephant sound sampled in it.
08/07/2015, 19:35 - Mike Joyce: Another? I have a feeling this may hit me like a tone of bricka
08/07/2015, 19:35 - Mike Joyce: *bricks
08/07/2015, 19:36 - Mike Joyce: That is good to know....next time I'm being mugged I will through that out there to confuse and distract....then I will run away
08/07/2015, 19:43 - Bongo: lol dude you sound plastered
08/07/2015, 19:44 - Mike Joyce: Ha ha...I'm just uber excited
08/07/2015, 19:44 - Mike Joyce: location: https://maps.google.com/?q=57.3643438,-4.3926291
08/07/2015, 19:45 - Bongo: I really want to see the new jp, everyone's saying it's so cheesy and bad that it's good

08/07/2015, 19:46 - Mike Joyce: I know that now
08/07/2015, 19:47 - Mike Joyce: Was thinking I could live by a loch and comute to work in a sea plane....that would be economical?
08/07/2015, 20:03 - Bongo: But you would have to land in the Thames every day
08/07/2015, 20:03 - Bongo: That shit is dirty
08/07/2015, 20:36 - Mike Joyce: One of the cleanest rivers in Europe! Apparently.....that's shut is just mud....tidal river innit
08/07/2015, 21:12 - Dave: Parachute into work
08/07/2015, 21:13 - Dave: Let the plane crash
08/07/2015, 21:14 - Mike Joyce: And send the plane pioletless carrering across London.....maybe 911 was just a comute
08/07/2015, 21:14 - Dave: An awesome commute
08/07/2015, 21:14 - Mike Joyce: I'm currently on caladonian sleeper heading back to london
08/07/2015, 21:14 - Dave: A more humanitarian commute

08/07/2015, 21:16 - Mike Joyce: <Media omitted>
08/07/2015, 21:20 - Mike Joyce: This is the best thing since sliced train....go to bed in London...wake up in Scotland....then back again.....could wake up "fresh" for work
08/07/2015, 21:21 - Mike SJ: Sliced train lol
08/07/2015, 21:21 - Mike SJ: They're called cars Mike
08/07/2015, 21:27 - Mike Joyce: I prefer the term transportation slices
09/07/2015, 02:49 - Bongo: Guy verhofstadt is awesome
09/07/2015, 09:32 - Mike SJ: I just watched the video of him.  Great orator, felt a bit like it was grandstanding at this point though
09/07/2015, 09:33 - Mike SJ: It's like lecturing your teenage son on cleaning his room while he's standing in front of you on fire
09/07/2015, 10:08 - Alex Bunn: Whats he done?
09/07/2015, 10:08 - Alex Bunn: I can't imagine why any Belgians would be awesome üòâ
09/07/2015, 10:15 - Mike SJ: When Jean Claude Van Damme is your coolest export you know you're in trouble
09/07/2015, 10:25 - Owen: Umm... Beer...
09/07/2015, 10:27 - Mike SJ: Beer's not a person Owen
09/07/2015, 10:26 - Owen: You just said "coolest export"
09/07/2015, 10:27 - Owen: Also beer makes me a different person
09/07/2015, 10:27 - Mike SJ: Fine alumnus then
09/07/2015, 10:27 - Owen: So I count it as a person
09/07/2015, 10:45 - Bongo: Guy is a European politician who hates ukip, especially Nigel garage
09/07/2015, 10:45 - Bongo: *twatface
09/07/2015, 11:36 - Joe Jarman: Top budget yesterday
09/07/2015, 11:36 - Joe Jarman: Torytastic
09/07/2015, 11:49 - Bongo: I didn't see it, was it all "stop giving money to those who need it because all the rich people want 2 faberge eggs each"?
09/07/2015, 11:58 - Owen: There's an online calculator where you can put in what you earn and see how much you save.  I'm ¬£7 a month better off. This makes me so glad we have a bedroom tax. I mean that ¬£7 will buy me an extra beer and a half, that's totally worth thousands of poor people being kicked out of thier homes through no fault of their own. Gooooo budget!!!
09/07/2015, 12:03 - Joe Jarman: I don't know about the no fault thing...
09/07/2015, 12:05 - Mike SJ: Yeah why don't they just try not being poor for once?
09/07/2015, 12:05 - Joe Jarman: Think there are some great incentives
09/07/2015, 12:05 - Joe Jarman: And capping child benefits is excellent
09/07/2015, 12:05 - Joe Jarman: Moving towards a one child policy!!!
09/07/2015, 12:05 - Joe Jarman: Stop the poor breeding!
09/07/2015, 12:08 - Mike SJ: Not convinced capping benefits is going to do anything to birth rates
09/07/2015, 12:09 - Mike SJ: Maybe some people have kids for benefits, but I really don't think that's normal
09/07/2015, 12:09 - Mike SJ: It's just going to increase the number of kids in poverty
09/07/2015, 12:09 - Tegan: especially the ones already born
09/07/2015, 12:10 - Tegan: that bbc synopsis we read yesterday was very right leaning
09/07/2015, 12:10 - Tegan: it didn't really mention any of the major tax cuts to low  income families
09/07/2015, 12:11 - Tegan: luckily now I've read the independent so I've got my bias back on course

09/07/2015, 19:53 - Tegan: aiight
10/07/2015, 10:59 - Tegan: what time is the lizard event tonight?
10/07/2015, 10:59 - Eliza: I have the table book from 7-10
10/07/2015, 11:01 - Tegan: Awesome :D
10/07/2015, 11:03 - Owen: How many spaces are there?
10/07/2015, 11:06 - Eliza: I booked for 8 - I think we have 7 people for sure and Cate, Sam and Krizia are maybes... I think it should be ok if we run over by a couple. If anyone else is planning on coming let me know though and I'll see if I can increase the table.
10/07/2015, 11:06 - Eliza: I don't think you *need* to be booked - but it would be nice if everyone had seats together...
10/07/2015, 11:20 - Bongo: Where is said lizard event?
10/07/2015, 11:20 - Bongo: What's it called?
10/07/2015, 11:22 - Owen: It's called an orgy with your lizard mother, bongo!
10/07/2015, 11:27 - Lorna: Was I on the yes list?
10/07/2015, 11:28 - Eliza: @bongo - it's at the last Tuesday society. Near London fields again. @lorna, I think so, yes.
10/07/2015, 11:29 - Lorna: Great, ta
10/07/2015, 11:34 - Owen: @bongo - a sensible answer. From Eliza.
10/07/2015, 11:40 - Bongo: @eliza was I on the list? If not can I gatecrash?
10/07/2015, 11:40 - Bongo: @owen, that name is a much better name for it, I think I'll just call it that from now on
10/07/2015, 11:42 - Owen: Yeah I know right. It's not even on a Tuesday, let alone last Tuesday.
10/07/2015, 11:50 - Eliza: Bongo you're on the list!
10/07/2015, 12:45 - Bongo: Yussss
10/07/2015, 12:45 - Bongo: What do you mean by booked a table as well, are we dining with the reptiles?
10/07/2015, 12:46 - Lorna: Or on the reptiles?
10/07/2015, 12:49 - Bongo: Sitting on the reptiles or eating them?
10/07/2015, 12:50 - Lorna: I guess it probably depends on the size reptile...
10/07/2015, 12:53 - Eliza: I think the plan is sit at a table, drink some drinks and have lizards presented for our amusement. I think they also serve food if you want any.
10/07/2015, 12:54 - Bongo: Cool, do we get to fight then Pokemon-style
10/07/2015, 12:55 - Eliza: Almost certainly. In fact I think it's encouraged.
10/07/2015, 12:55 - Bongo: Tarantula, I choose you! Then chuck it in Owen's face
10/07/2015, 12:56 - Bongo: Tarantula, use anti-socialist arguments
10/07/2015, 12:57 - Bongo: Anti-socialist arguments is super effective!

22/07/2015, 14:37 - Shaggy: I considered it, but given how much everyone hypes it up I can only be disappointed
22/07/2015, 14:57 - Alex Bunn: Wrong

22/07/2015, 20:00 - Vanessa: Shaggy I had the same feeling. I heard so much about it I didn't want to listen to it. It took me about six months before I decided to and really loved it

23/07/2015, 17:18 - Joe Jarman: Star wars secret cinema
23/07/2015, 17:18 - Joe Jarman: Definitely the best possible secret cinema
23/07/2015, 17:26 - Dave: Could be cool - won't be cheap (¬£70?)
23/07/2015, 17:26 - Joe Jarman: üòé
23/07/2015, 17:26 - Joe Jarman: üôà but pricey
23/07/2015, 17:27 - Dave: Exactly. Wise monkey
23/07/2015, 17:29 - Joe Jarman: Definitely once of a lifetime experience
24/07/2015, 12:25 - Mike SJ: Who's up for Inside Out next week?

24/07/2015, 14:06 - Alex Bunn: You'll probably hate it
24/07/2015, 14:15 - Hannah Murphy: I've heard it's as good as serial
24/07/2015, 14:34 - Mike SJ: Lol
24/07/2015, 14:44 - Shaggy: Even rotten tomatoes is mistaken sometimes
24/07/2015, 14:48 - Owen: Do you mean even shaggy's rotten tomatoes inverse is mistaken sometimes?
24/07/2015, 14:51 - Shaggy: Same thing. There exists a limited set of films that both of us would enjoy. It's very small, so it's a rate occurrence
24/07/2015, 15:34 - Bongo: This dude working next to me keeps singing like a 4 year old every now and again
24/07/2015, 15:34 - Bongo: üò°
24/07/2015, 15:34 - Alex Bunn: Video pls
24/07/2015, 15:38 - Shaggy: Haha
24/07/2015, 15:39 - Shaggy: This dude next to me keep alternative between "fuck" and "yes". With a French accent. It's hilarious
24/07/2015, 16:29 - Bongo: Ffs he's the most distracting person
24/07/2015, 16:29 - Bongo: He's doing impressions of a geeky consultant
24/07/2015, 16:30 - Bongo: He's got his top button done up, glasses on and mumbling "this is consulting, this is consulting"
24/07/2015, 16:35 - Shaggy: Hahaha
24/07/2015, 16:41 - Owen: Bongo, have you moved from goldman sachs to whatever asylum was featured in one flew over the cuckoo's nest? Say hi to danny de vito for me.
24/07/2015, 16:49 - Bongo: I reckon so
24/07/2015, 16:50 - Bongo: It would be really creepy if I found out this is actually an insane asylum and I've checked myself in without realising it
24/07/2015, 16:52 - Shaggy: That would be crazy
24/07/2015, 16:54 - Owen: #shutterIsland
24/07/2015, 16:54 - Owen: #shockCorridor
24/07/2015, 16:55 - Owen: But seriously watch those two films, they are Aaaawwwsssooommmee.
24/07/2015, 17:35 - Shaggy: I loved shutter island. Haven't seen the other one
24/07/2015, 18:06 - Mike SJ: Shutter island was whack
24/07/2015, 18:07 - Mike SJ: I spent the entire movie trying to convince myself the twist wasn't going to be that obvious
24/07/2015, 18:07 - Owen: You're clearly an idiot.
24/07/2015, 18:07 - Owen: Because that film was amazing
24/07/2015, 18:08 - Owen: And yes I also saw the twist coming a mile off.
24/07/2015, 18:15 - Mike SJ: Nah sorry that film had a dumb plot, no subtlety, and had a really shit attitude to mental health
24/07/2015, 18:15 - Mike SJ: (sorry to pull that card, but it is true)
24/07/2015, 18:16 - Tegan: It was beautiful
24/07/2015, 18:24 - Mike SJ: Maybe in a zero-depth, Pamela Anderson sense
24/07/2015, 18:24 - Mike SJ: I don't know why that film annoys me so, but I really think Scorsese has pulled a fast one on all of you
24/07/2015, 19:32 - Alex Bunn: I didnt see the twist coming. But i also didnt see the 6th sense twist coming
24/07/2015, 19:32 - Alex Bunn: #sucker
24/07/2015, 19:37 - Shaggy: You and me both
24/07/2015, 19:37 - Shaggy: But then I also thought Star Trek sucked balls
24/07/2015, 19:37 - Shaggy: Mike is just wrong
24/07/2015, 19:47 - Mike SJ: Nah, couldn't be
24/07/2015, 19:48 - Mike SJ: It's a classic silly B movie, it's silly to treat it as more than that
24/07/2015, 19:49 - Mike SJ: I'm done.
24/07/2015, 20:03 - Owen: Why are you treating it as more than that then.
24/07/2015, 20:07 - Mike SJ: 'Amazing', 'beautiful'
24/07/2015, 20:17 - Alex Bunn: Wow i just got soaked
24/07/2015, 20:18 - Alex Bunn: Should ve stayed in the pub!
24/07/2015, 20:18 - Martha: <Media omitted>
24/07/2015, 20:18 - Martha: Rain? What rain?
24/07/2015, 20:26 - Shaggy: Bah-rain
24/07/2015, 20:27 - Shaggy: Oh wait that's Scotland
24/07/2015, 20:27 - Shaggy: Did you do it marth?
24/07/2015, 20:28 - Martha: 87 miles down - halfway. SOMANYHILLS
24/07/2015, 20:30 - Alex Bunn: Looks shit
24/07/2015, 20:30 - Alex Bunn: üí©
24/07/2015, 20:31 - Martha: Bust my back wheel up pretty bad nailing all the cattle grids too fast. Thankfully got it fixed up pretty this morning in the town I was passing, and am good to keep going.
24/07/2015, 20:32 - Alex Bunn: üôå praise Jesus
24/07/2015, 20:32 - Martha: Ta.
24/07/2015, 20:32 - Martha: I don't think that was his name though.
24/07/2015, 20:33 - Owen: Derrick
24/07/2015, 20:34 - Martha: The dude used to work in brick lane bikes in London when it first started up. Swapped it in for a place of his own and epic nature every day. Have to say I'm pretty tempted.
24/07/2015, 20:37 - Shaggy: Still steals every back wheel he can't find
24/07/2015, 20:42 - Martha: You can take the mechanic out of brick lane...
24/07/2015, 20:58 - Shaggy: Without paying any money...
25/07/2015, 10:42 - Mike SJ: <Media omitted>

25/07/2015, 17:27 - Shaggy: Would love to. Let's do Europe later in the year, Italy in october/November?
25/07/2015, 17:29 - Martha: Long as it's not too snowy. Italy sounds great, they've got the food, wine and landscape. That's a hat trick.
25/07/2015, 19:38 - Vanessa: I'll take the train and meet you at the destinations
25/07/2015, 19:38 - Bongo: Down for Europe
25/07/2015, 19:39 - Bongo: 40% off ba flights in Europe with my life assurance
25/07/2015, 19:39 - Mike SJ: Lol, take a taxi and taunt them
25/07/2015, 19:59 - Sam Roberts: Always fancied a cycle across Spain, Italy would be most boday as well!
25/07/2015, 20:00 - Sam Roberts: You done Marth? Epic ride!
25/07/2015, 20:00 - Sam Roberts: Man that really puts our Cambridge antics to shame üòâ
25/07/2015, 21:14 - Martha: Nah, final day tomorrow. 30miles left, couple of ferries, train to Glasgow and then night train home. Yay! Xx
25/07/2015, 22:08 - Sam Roberts: Heavy sleeper train after all that!
26/07/2015, 10:07 - Mike SJ: Sunday? More like Rainday amirite?
26/07/2015, 10:08 - Mike SJ: #selffive

26/07/2015, 10:39 - Mike SJ: In-jokes
26/07/2015, 10:41 - Hannah Murphy: For those of you who missed it, shaggy ranted persistently last night about how cashew nuts are like tiny penises
26/07/2015, 10:41 - Hannah Murphy: And I mean persistently
26/07/2015, 10:46 - Mike SJ: Yeah shaggy, you've ruined cashew nuts for me forever now
26/07/2015, 10:46 - Mike SJ: I'm never going to be able to take them seriously again
26/07/2015, 11:31 - Bongo: Was he still going on about that?
26/07/2015, 11:31 - Bongo: And yea cheers bunny, awesome times
26/07/2015, 11:40 - Alex Bunn: Everyone else will have to swing round next time!
26/07/2015, 14:35 - Dave: Whoop
27/07/2015, 13:14 - Mike SJ: <Media omitted>
27/07/2015, 14:05 - Shaggy: Haha
27/07/2015, 14:05 - Shaggy: Must be a pit ill
27/07/2015, 14:05 - Shaggy: Pitbull
27/07/2015, 14:06 - Shaggy: In the absence of pizza I think we should make wraps again, they were delicious last time. Assuming anyone is coming...
27/07/2015, 14:07 - Owen: Are you lot still watching poo detective?
27/07/2015, 14:33 - Alex Bunn: I think iv given up
27/07/2015, 14:34 - Owen: I'll come along for food and drinks but might nip off before shit cop.
27/07/2015, 14:37 - Mike SJ: In two weeks there'll be a Rick and Morty we haven't seen
27/07/2015, 14:38 - Mike SJ: That'll be the shot in the arm we need
27/07/2015, 14:40 - Owen: Yeah that'll be much better than crap pig.
27/07/2015, 14:44 - Lorna: So which night shall we watch inside out? Wednesday?
27/07/2015, 14:46 - Mike SJ: Yeah I think Weds is best for a few people
27/07/2015, 14:47 - Mike SJ: I'm not organising this one after the Mad Max fiasco
27/07/2015, 14:47 - Owen: Is that "few people" you mike?
27/07/2015, 14:47 - Mike SJ: Sam and Kriz as well
27/07/2015, 14:48 - Mike SJ: I can do tomo if its better
27/07/2015, 14:49 - Lorna: Weds also better for me
27/07/2015, 14:52 - Owen: I am home this week so would prefer the weekend, but it looks like that won't happen so don't mind about me.
27/07/2015, 14:54 - Lorna: Well, when we organise it for weds, and fail to all get to the same cinema they'll probably be a second attempt at the weekend
27/07/2015, 14:58 - Sam Roberts: So I guess we should book tickets this time
27/07/2015, 15:12 - Dave: Tuesday has cheap tickets in some cinemas. Can anyone only do wed?
27/07/2015, 16:18 - Lorna: Is unlikely I can do any day apart from weds. Also, if you buy insurance through comparethemarket.com you get 241 cinema tickets Tuesday and Wednesday. And one day of travel insurance in the UK is about ¬£2
27/07/2015, 16:18 - Lorna: Bit late for this week though
27/07/2015, 16:39 - Joe Jarman: I've got a code!
27/07/2015, 16:46 - Mike SJ: Lol, that's pretty random
27/07/2015, 16:49 - Joe Jarman: I've been banging on about it for months
27/07/2015, 16:49 - Joe Jarman: Haven't actually been  to the cinema yet
27/07/2015, 16:49 - Mike SJ: Good find Lorna
27/07/2015, 16:49 - Joe Jarman: ....
27/07/2015, 16:49 - Joe Jarman: .....
27/07/2015, 16:50 - Dave: Go lorna! üôè
27/07/2015, 16:50 - Joe Jarman: Wooooo lorna üòé
27/07/2015, 16:50 - Joe Jarman: üòî
27/07/2015, 17:16 - Lorna: Yay for me! üòÑ
27/07/2015, 17:30 - Dave: What's the plan for tonight?
27/07/2015, 17:44 - Lorna: Looks like there isn't one
27/07/2015, 17:47 - Lorna: Though we could go for food/drinks if people don't fancy true detective?
27/07/2015, 18:18 - Dave: Shabongo?
27/07/2015, 18:19 - Tegan: Mike, we have proms on Wednesday i think
27/07/2015, 18:20 - Tegan: RACHMANANOV!

27/07/2015, 18:21 - Krizia: Why dont we do it maybe Thursday
27/07/2015, 18:21 - Krizia: Or next week?
27/07/2015, 18:22 - Sam Roberts: Could do a late one tomorrow, got the climbing first though
27/07/2015, 18:22 - Dave: Next week could make sense
27/07/2015, 18:23 - Sam Roberts: Good shout, seems like we've got about 50% anytime this week!
27/07/2015, 18:23 - Mike SJ: And we can all buy travel insurance
27/07/2015, 18:23 - Tegan: Evening plan?
27/07/2015, 18:24 - Tegan: I'm still up for true detective
27/07/2015, 18:24 - Tegan: I quite enjoyed last weeks
27/07/2015, 18:24 - Tegan: Now I'm over the fact that it'll never be as good as the original
27/07/2015, 18:24 - Shaggy: I made some pulled pork for the wraps
27/07/2015, 18:25 - Tegan: Any pulled parsnips?
27/07/2015, 18:25 - Dave: You can't pull a parsnip
27/07/2015, 18:25 - Dave: üò≥
27/07/2015, 18:25 - Shaggy: Alas
27/07/2015, 18:26 - Dave: We'll bring something veggie to wrap
27/07/2015, 18:26 - Dave: You got enough wraps?
27/07/2015, 18:26 - Sam Roberts: I trust Dave as a man who's tried
27/07/2015, 18:26 - Shaggy: I'm still at work, will buy some on the way home
27/07/2015, 18:27 - Tegan: Just kicked out of work by a 6.25 fire alarm, so happy to go shopping
27/07/2015, 18:58 - Vanessa: Omg Rachmaninov! So jealous.  I always forget about the proms until it's too late
27/07/2015, 18:58 - Dave: I'm sure there's still some tickets
27/07/2015, 19:00 - Vanessa: I'll have a look
27/07/2015, 19:02 - Dave: You can always prom it too
27/07/2015, 19:09 - Vanessa: What does that mean?
27/07/2015, 19:43 - Tegan: If you queue for a while before ('prom') you get ¬£5 standing tickets
27/07/2015, 19:48 - Vanessa: Oh I might be able to do that
27/07/2015, 20:54 - Tegan: http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/articles/3598F306c3KnN6t3x6ThKpN/what-is-promming
27/07/2015, 20:54 - Tegan: Does this mean you're home, v??
27/07/2015, 21:05 - Vanessa: Yes it deos

28/07/2015, 08:50 - Sam Roberts: VV
28/07/2015, 08:50 - Sam Roberts: You guys should get together so we can call you W
28/07/2015, 08:51 - Sam Roberts: Anyone fancy a non-inside out film tomorrow?
28/07/2015, 08:53 - Sam Roberts: Minions or ant man could be fun
28/07/2015, 08:53 - Sam Roberts: What I really fancy is the new terminator and a bottle of rum though
28/07/2015, 09:23 - Tegan: Movie could be good - it's cineworld cheap night
28/07/2015, 09:24 - Tegan: How bad is the new terminator supposed to be?
28/07/2015, 09:59 - Mike SJ: Supposed to better than the last one
28/07/2015, 09:59 - Mike SJ: So not bad enough
28/07/2015, 10:12 - Joe Jarman: Haha
28/07/2015, 10:13 - Joe Jarman: Luana and I are going to see inside out in c wharf tonight

28/07/2015, 11:15 - Joe Jarman: I.e. 14.95/month for unlimited films for two people
28/07/2015, 11:15 - Joe Jarman: That's a deal
28/07/2015, 11:16 - Joe Jarman: You only need to see 1 film a month for that to make sense
28/07/2015, 11:20 - Mike SJ: Have you been to the cinema this year yet?
28/07/2015, 11:23 - Sam Roberts: I went to see Jurassic park the other day
28/07/2015, 11:23 - Sam Roberts: Which is awesome
28/07/2015, 11:24 - Sam Roberts: Really dumb in places, but all the introductions to the dinosaurs made me feel like a kid again

29/07/2015, 09:15 - Owen: Full cartoon. Turns out I only saved one image of it.
30/07/2015, 16:22 - Mike SJ: Who do you reckon is the most famous Japanese person?
30/07/2015, 16:22 - Mike SJ: It seems really hard to think of them for some reason
30/07/2015, 16:23 - Mike SJ: Mr Miyagi?
30/07/2015, 16:23 - Shaggy: Suzuki? Mitsubishi?
30/07/2015, 16:24 - Mike SJ: I know nothing about either of those people
30/07/2015, 16:24 - Mike SJ: Except they started a car company
30/07/2015, 16:24 - Shaggy: Do you need to know about them? You said most famous
30/07/2015, 16:25 - Mike SJ: I think you should at least be able to pick them out of a line up
30/07/2015, 16:25 - Owen: Kurosawa
30/07/2015, 16:26 - Dan Sluckin: Godzilla?
30/07/2015, 16:26 - Mike SJ: The red power ranger
30/07/2015, 16:27 - Mike SJ: Shit, I think the real answer might be Yoko Ono
30/07/2015, 16:29 - Joe Jarman: Kesuke miyagi
30/07/2015, 16:32 - Dan Sluckin: Ken Watanabe
30/07/2015, 16:34 - Owen: It's obviously kurosawa
30/07/2015, 16:35 - Mike SJ: There is no way kurosawa is more well known than yoko ono
30/07/2015, 16:35 - Mike SJ: Much as I'd love prefer to be true
30/07/2015, 16:36 - Owen: Yoko oh no!!
30/07/2015, 16:40 - Tegan: I'd only know her as the one drinking out of a bowler hay
30/07/2015, 16:40 - Tegan: Hat
30/07/2015, 16:41 - Tegan: Would possibly fail buzzcocks line up
30/07/2015, 16:43 - Alex Bunn: Sad but possibly true
30/07/2015, 16:43 - Alex Bunn: Yuko wins
30/07/2015, 16:52 - Bongo: Surely the emperor
30/07/2015, 16:54 - Mike SJ: Takeshi?

30/07/2015, 16:56 - Joe Jarman: Hiromi tanaka
30/07/2015, 16:59 - Owen: The irony of you calling her yuko is palpable.
30/07/2015, 17:00 - Alex Bunn: Lol
30/07/2015, 17:00 - Alex Bunn: Ah well
30/07/2015, 17:00 - Alex Bunn: Hey are peeps aware that aussie Loz is leaving
30/07/2015, 17:00 - Alex Bunn: And tomorrow is a big party

30/07/2015, 17:09 - Shaggy: Mr ghibli, whatever his name is
30/07/2015, 17:09 - Shaggy: Samurai champloo
30/07/2015, 17:11 - Krizia: Mr Wasabe
30/07/2015, 17:15 - Bongo: Jackie chan
30/07/2015, 17:15 - Shaggy: He's Chinese...
30/07/2015, 17:15 - Alex Bunn: Racist
30/07/2015, 17:16 - Shaggy: Surely racist is he who can't tell the difference
30/07/2015, 17:17 - Alex Bunn: It was directed at bong
30/07/2015, 17:21 - Shaggy: It's hard to tell who you're looking at in whatsapp
30/07/2015, 17:37 - Alex Bunn: You were just quicker!
30/07/2015, 17:41 - Sam Roberts: Star trek guy
30/07/2015, 17:41 - Sam Roberts: George takeshi
30/07/2015, 17:42 - Krizia: üë≤
30/07/2015, 17:42 - Krizia: This guy!
30/07/2015, 17:55 - Mike SJ: Ash Ketchum
30/07/2015, 22:41 - Dave: "Number 1 priority" - when you really need a wee
30/07/2015, 23:41 - Sam Roberts: No one talks about a number 2 priority
31/07/2015, 00:16 - Dan Sluckin: Go ahead
31/07/2015, 00:16 - Owen: Dan, what's your favourite food?
31/07/2015, 00:17 - Dan Sluckin: Sutton Spaghetti Bolognese
31/07/2015, 00:17 - Owen: Dan I have another question.
31/07/2015, 00:17 - Owen: But will ask it in Owen and Dan horde
31/07/2015, 01:49 - Mike SJ: Blasphemy!
31/07/2015, 01:50 - Mike SJ: For it is written : 'I am the horde thy God. Thou shalt have no other hordes before me'
31/07/2015, 01:51 - Mike SJ: Shaggy ban them
31/07/2015, 08:44 - Sam Roberts: <Media omitted>
31/07/2015, 08:45 - Bongo: Why can't they just wire the amount they miss sold to our accounts?
31/07/2015, 08:45 - Bongo: Why bother calling?
31/07/2015, 08:47 - Sam Roberts: Good question
31/07/2015, 08:47 - Sam Roberts: I'd guess bad record keeping
31/07/2015, 08:54 - Dave: I think they need to establish that it was missold in each case. My dad got asked lots of questions when he applied.
31/07/2015, 09:15 - Sam Roberts: Did he win?
31/07/2015, 09:15 - Shaggy: Question is why they call non lloyds customers
31/07/2015, 09:16 - Dave: He did - tbh i don't think it's that hard!
31/07/2015, 09:17 - Sam Roberts: I'd go for it if I'd ever had credit
31/07/2015, 09:18 - Sam Roberts: It's all banks shag, think hsbc had a similar provision recently
31/07/2015, 09:20 - Dave: Our economic department are always keen to point out that PPI compensation has been so large (~¬£20bn) that it has probably had a macroeconomic effect on the UK economy.
31/07/2015, 09:37 - Bongo: Wow
31/07/2015, 09:37 - Bongo: More like "definitely"
31/07/2015, 09:38 - Bongo: 20 billion coming out of pockets of people who were borrowing money
31/07/2015, 09:38 - Bongo: During a recession
31/07/2015, 10:14 - Dave: Well, a lot of the money was taken from the borrowers pre-recession and the returned as a lump sum post recession. In that sense it was a significant fiscal stimulus (although it is true that there was also a drain from the economy to 'fund' it, but over a longer time)
31/07/2015, 10:48 - Bongo: Was it paid back with interest? You can't say taking ¬£100 and giving it back a few years later is a fiscal stimulus, that's preventing any potential investment
31/07/2015, 10:49 - Owen: Well a bank did have it. And theoretically they should be more efficient investors than your average joe.
31/07/2015, 10:57 - Dave: Injecting 20bn into the economy is surely a stimulus. Although you could say it's like giving someone a long relaxing massage then injecting them with adrenaline.
31/07/2015, 11:00 - Shaggy: Yawn. Make a finance group
31/07/2015, 11:00 - Tegan: Woah there Shaggy
31/07/2015, 11:01 - Tegan: Then where will i get my opinions on finance from?
31/07/2015, 11:01 - Mike SJ: The finance group
31/07/2015, 11:01 - Shaggy: Finance group
31/07/2015, 11:01 - Mike SJ: lol
31/07/2015, 11:01 - Dave: üçç
31/07/2015, 11:02 - Tegan: I'm not going to join the finance group
31/07/2015, 11:02 - Tegan: Yawn
31/07/2015, 11:03 - Shaggy: Lol
31/07/2015, 11:03 - Dave: This is nerdgasm fare i think
31/07/2015, 11:04 - Shaggy: It's not nerdy, it's boring
31/07/2015, 11:05 - Mike SJ: Boregasm
31/07/2015, 11:05 - Shaggy: Nailed it
31/07/2015, 11:10 - Dave: What's boring about major redress schemes being viewed as fiscal stimuli?
31/07/2015, 11:10 - Dave: Oh god...
31/07/2015, 11:10 - Dave: üòî
31/07/2015, 11:20 - Mike SJ: Man I always forget that there's like  30 people on this group
31/07/2015, 11:20 - Mike SJ: I wonder how many of them actually read every comment?
31/07/2015, 11:26 - Owen: Just you
31/07/2015, 11:28 - Mike SJ: I think I've read a good 95%
31/07/2015, 11:30 - Mike SJ: Sometimes it's says 153 new messages and I'm like 'how about no'
31/07/2015, 11:30 - Mike SJ: True story
31/07/2015, 11:39 - Owen: Riveting; and you had the nerve to call economics boring.
31/07/2015, 11:55 - Mike SJ: I have a story : last night I went on a date, and half way through she said she didn't like white people
31/07/2015, 11:58 - Dave: Wow - and you stayed for the second half?
31/07/2015, 11:58 - Mike SJ: Second half of the first pint yeah lol
31/07/2015, 11:58 - Owen: Why was she on a date with a white person then!!
31/07/2015, 11:59 - Owen: What race was she?
31/07/2015, 11:59 - Mike SJ: Definitely at least half white
31/07/2015, 11:59 - Mike SJ: I didn't say it made sense
31/07/2015, 11:59 - Owen: To be fair I don't like the majority of white people
31/07/2015, 11:59 - Dave: Lol
31/07/2015, 11:59 - Owen: I don't like the majority of people though
31/07/2015, 11:59 - Krizia: Hahahhahahha
31/07/2015, 12:01 - Mike SJ: Nice to have a low bar though
31/07/2015, 12:01 - Mike SJ: Only uphill from here
31/07/2015, 12:02 - Owen: Did she clarify at all?
31/07/2015, 12:07 - Mike SJ: Nah I wish I'd asked
31/07/2015, 12:07 - Owen: Because I don't like a black person - Bill Cosby
31/07/2015, 12:08 - Mike SJ: Instead of doing what I actually did which was stare blankly in silence for about 15 seconds and then change the subject
31/07/2015, 12:08 - Owen: Maybe she just doesn't like Taylor Swift's music and it came out wrong.
31/07/2015, 12:08 - Mike SJ: lol
31/07/2015, 12:13 - Tegan: Did she seem at all phased by this turn off events?
31/07/2015, 12:13 - Tegan: Does your profile have a picture? Or do you claim to be black?
31/07/2015, 12:16 - Mike SJ: Nah, I and everyone else in all my profile pictures are pretty clearly white
31/07/2015, 12:16 - Mike SJ: Women just can't resist I guess
31/07/2015, 12:16 - Owen: Woman*
31/07/2015, 12:17 - Dave: Ha
31/07/2015, 12:17 - Dave: üê£
31/07/2015, 13:20 - Owen: <Media omitted>
31/07/2015, 13:22 - Bongo: I don't get it
31/07/2015, 13:22 - Bongo: Here you can keep it?
31/07/2015, 13:36 - Owen: Herefordshire, you can keep it
31/07/2015, 13:41 - Owen: Is Loz party tonight or tomorrow?
31/07/2015, 13:48 - Bongo: Tonight
31/07/2015, 14:28 - Owen: Where is it.
31/07/2015, 14:28 - Owen: I get back to London about 10
31/07/2015, 14:32 - Mike SJ: Dunno where we'll be by then
31/07/2015, 14:32 - Mike SJ: Give someone a ring
31/07/2015, 14:32 - Mike SJ: But East London most likely
31/07/2015, 14:32 - Owen: Is it not at her house?
31/07/2015, 14:40 - Alex Bunn: Nah shoreditch most likely
31/07/2015, 14:40 - Alex Bunn: Think she's already moved out
31/07/2015, 14:41 - Owen: What's the plan for the evening.
31/07/2015, 14:41 - Owen: I'm getting into Euston at about 10 it would be nice to pop over for one on my way home.
31/07/2015, 15:09 - Bongo: <Media omitted>
31/07/2015, 15:21 - Alex Bunn: Not sure there is a plan O
31/07/2015, 15:21 - Alex Bunn: Usual mess of affairs
31/07/2015, 15:40 - Owen: I guess I'll just ask at 9:30
31/07/2015, 15:40 - Owen: If you are near Euston I'll come a knocking. If not I'll have been on a train for three house and will just head home.
31/07/2015, 17:38 - Bongo: And the award for laziest employee goes to.. The crazy guy who was sitting next to me last week who's now just constantly on reddit
31/07/2015, 17:56 - Owen: That's what happens when a company doesn't arbitrarily fire 5% of it's employees each year.
31/07/2015, 17:58 - Bongo: 20%
31/07/2015, 17:58 - Bongo: And I suppose
31/07/2015, 17:59 - Bongo: He would definitely be a likely candidate
31/07/2015, 18:02 - Owen: I thought it was 5, 20 wtf!
31/07/2015, 18:03 - Bongo: It's up to 20%, it's usually one or two from each team, usually contractors
31/07/2015, 18:09 - Shaggy: If it arbitrary it wouldn't help
31/07/2015, 18:09 - Shaggy: He could be hella lucky
31/07/2015, 21:02 - Sam Roberts: <Media omitted>
31/07/2015, 21:50 - Owen: Where abouts are people?
31/07/2015, 21:57 - Sam Roberts: Lisa's place

31/07/2015, 21:57 - Sam Roberts: E26ng
31/07/2015, 22:00 - Owen: Perhaps.
31/07/2015, 22:25 - Owen: Is that where everyone will be for the next hour?
01/08/2015, 13:02 - Owen: Hey horde. Is there anyone on here that doesn't know programming, or only knows a few things that would like to learn more?
01/08/2015, 13:23 - Sam Roberts: ‚úã
01/08/2015, 13:24 - Sam Roberts: In particular setting up heroku databases and apis
01/08/2015, 13:24 - Owen: You might already know a bit much Sam.
01/08/2015, 13:26 - Sam Roberts: Aww
01/08/2015, 13:26 - Owen: I'm looking for noobs to test this new work book that I will be teaching to year 8 next year. Just to iron out kinks and things that I haven't explained as well as I think I have.
01/08/2015, 13:26 - Sam Roberts: Oh yeah, I'm working at about a year 10 level
01/08/2015, 13:26 - Owen: You can give it a go though. But it is very much a beginner course
01/08/2015, 13:27 - Sam Roberts: Be happy to test run it anyway if you want though
01/08/2015, 13:27 - Sam Roberts: Hehe win
01/08/2015, 13:27 - Sam Roberts: Does it have any pi exercises in?
01/08/2015, 13:27 - Owen: Nah, it's all arduino
01/08/2015, 13:28 - Sam Roberts: Also cool
01/08/2015, 13:28 - Sam Roberts: Gimme a copy tomorrow
01/08/2015, 13:30 - Owen: I can't
01/08/2015, 13:31 - Owen: School is closed on the weekend so I can't pick up arduinos
01/08/2015, 13:32 - Sam Roberts: Ah I see, thought you meant all book work

01/08/2015, 13:47 - Sam Roberts: <Media omitted>
01/08/2015, 13:47 - Owen: Nothing is perfect Hannah!
01/08/2015, 13:48 - Owen: The kids know nothing to so it's aimed at that.
01/08/2015, 13:55 - Hannah Murphy: Great! I'll try
01/08/2015, 14:00 - Owen: So I'll bring a copy and an arduino for the following people: Sam, Hannah, V and Bunn.
01/08/2015, 14:00 - Vanessa: Yay!
01/08/2015, 14:03 - Hannah Murphy: As long as I can outcode shaggy by the end of it

03/08/2015, 15:25 - Bongo: It's getting more and more hardcore
03/08/2015, 15:26 - Bongo: Maybe it's worth seeing the end of the last episode if people haven't seen it yet, I wouldn't mind watching it again
03/08/2015, 15:54 - Alex Bunn: Im gonna pass again
03/08/2015, 16:16 - Owen: I have arduinos ready for you four.
03/08/2015, 16:16 - Owen: Shaggy, I will leave hannahs with you.
03/08/2015, 16:17 - Owen: The other three of you will have to get them off me another time
03/08/2015, 16:28 - Shaggy: O, can you bring one power cable for a pi? I didn't grab one yesterday
03/08/2015, 16:33 - Tegan: We're running a bit behind schedule boat wise
03/08/2015, 16:33 - Tegan: But should still make Monday club
03/08/2015, 16:38 - Alex Bunn: Do you wanna leave it at Shaggys and we can pick it up sometime 
?
03/08/2015, 16:39 - Owen: That'll be fine.
03/08/2015, 16:40 - Owen: I will leave all of them at shaggy's

03/08/2015, 19:43 - Eliza: Yup there will be!
03/08/2015, 19:47 - Dave: Thanks all. Sorry to be late. The oxford canal is treacherous and slow.

03/08/2015, 21:23 - Dave: X
04/08/2015, 14:28 - Mike SJ: Do people wana do Inside Out this week?
04/08/2015, 14:28 - Mike SJ: Tube strike might be a problem...
04/08/2015, 14:29 - Lorna: Yeah I do. How's Stratford for people? The overground and DLR are working
04/08/2015, 14:34 - Krizia: I dont mind the tube strike if we have overground/any form of transport.... Good excuse to wfh thursday!!! ‚ò∫
04/08/2015, 14:58 - Sam Roberts: Haha I might hit a 4 day wfh week!
04/08/2015, 14:58 - Sam Roberts: I'm in for anywhere Wednesday
04/08/2015, 16:24 - Joe Jarman: Anybody went a meerkat code?
04/08/2015, 16:24 - Joe Jarman: Want?
04/08/2015, 16:24 - Mike SJ: Yes please

04/08/2015, 16:26 - Mike SJ: Ta
04/08/2015, 19:01 - Tegan: Has anyone had a plaintive plea for sanctuary from Dave?
04/08/2015, 19:02 - Tegan: We were due down to Oliza's, but grim happenings at LB have stopped all the trains
04/08/2015, 19:02 - Tegan: I think his phone is dead now
04/08/2015, 19:03 - Vanessa: What's happening at LB?
04/08/2015, 19:03 - Tegan: Person under train I think :(
04/08/2015, 19:03 - Bongo: How inconsiderate
04/08/2015, 19:05 - Vanessa: Oh dear
04/08/2015, 19:05 - Mike SJ: I'll be home if you need a place
04/08/2015, 19:05 - Tegan: Oh dear is right - they should have a code for it
04/08/2015, 19:06 - Tegan: I can only think of really tasteless ideas...
04/08/2015, 19:06 - Tegan: That might be very awesome - Dave didn't message you did he?
04/08/2015, 19:07 - Mike SJ: Nah Sam I think
04/08/2015, 19:08 - Tegan: Same area code :)
04/08/2015, 19:08 - Tegan: Will I bring beer? Or gin?
04/08/2015, 19:09 - Mike SJ: Either/or :)
04/08/2015, 19:12 - Lorna: I like to know why my train is delayed, even if it is for morbid reasons. A 'customer incident' is too ambiguous. It unnerves me when they say that.
04/08/2015, 19:13 - Tegan: Sounds knife-wavy
04/08/2015, 21:06 - Lorna: Inside out people: it's showing at Stratford Westfield at 18:50 and 19:40. Either works for me. I vote we book. Any preference? Or different cinema?
04/08/2015, 21:25 - Shaggy: You know where we live, tegs ;)
04/08/2015, 21:37 - Shaggy: True detective finale is 90 mins

05/08/2015, 08:13 - Sam Roberts: He's much better armed
05/08/2015, 08:15 - Shaggy: He'll be blue if he doesn't win
05/08/2015, 08:20 - Tegan: <Media omitted>
05/08/2015, 10:32 - Mike SJ: We doing Stratford cinema tonight then?

05/08/2015, 12:51 - Lorna: But I'm still game, happy to wait though
05/08/2015, 12:56 - Krizia: ‚ò∫‚ò∫üò≥
05/08/2015, 12:58 - Krizia: The tube is what it sucks!!! I dont mind going tonight!!! But tomorrow stuck in ctown till friday!!! üò≥üò≥ dont know if I can manage :p
05/08/2015, 13:00 - Sam Roberts: But it's a paradise on earth
05/08/2015, 13:00 - Sam Roberts: We have a newly spare room... Anyone looking for a place to live?
05/08/2015, 13:01 - Owen: Who moved out?
05/08/2015, 13:01 - Sam Roberts: Andre the grumpy Portuguese
05/08/2015, 13:03 - Owen: Haha
05/08/2015, 13:04 - Owen: Replace him with a grumpy reclusive gamblaholic
05/08/2015, 13:04 - Krizia: Hahaha
05/08/2015, 13:23 - Mike SJ: Yeah, ctown wfh partay tomorrow, do it!

05/08/2015, 14:40 - Mike SJ: The London Olympics were so good, why even bother? They should just rename it as the London Olympics from now on.
05/08/2015, 14:41 - Mike SJ: Next year, the London Olympics in Rio
05/08/2015, 16:42 - Alex Bunn: Feels like they're coming around so quickly!
05/08/2015, 16:44 - Mike SJ: <Media omitted>
05/08/2015, 16:44 - Mike SJ: Bloody hate that advert

05/08/2015, 16:55 - Sam Roberts: Weekend?
05/08/2015, 16:59 - Lorna: Yeah OK. Though I've been conditioned into thinking that films occur only on Tuesdays and Wednesdays, and on some sort of offer
05/08/2015, 17:09 - Tegan: Are people coming down to E&C way for Adele's leaving do on Saturday?
05/08/2015, 17:13 - Alex Bunn: Yah ‚úã

05/08/2015, 21:24 - Joe Jarman: I bet the 99p store guy was chuffed when he landed that location
05/08/2015, 21:56 - Dan Sluckin: That's brilliant.
06/08/2015, 10:40 - Alex Bunn: Hands up if you're NOT working from home today
06/08/2015, 10:40 - Alex Bunn: ‚úãüò≠

06/08/2015, 10:47 - Lorna: Working from home is the best!
06/08/2015, 10:48 - Henry Dranks: I dunno im finding it pretty hard to actually work I think I need an office
06/08/2015, 10:48 - Mike SJ: Yeah same

06/08/2015, 10:50 - Mike SJ: Thug life
06/08/2015, 10:50 - Krizia: It builds pressure points were you actually need to work and were you can just chill!
06/08/2015, 10:51 - Lorna: And George Osbourne owes me, that's my theory
06/08/2015, 10:51 - Krizia: Is nice is like a real version of how work should be! Some good days some days of nothing less pretending.... I just miss the office gossip

06/08/2015, 13:34 - Mike SJ: Talk Sport: If you want to pretend to be an Aussie batsman this afternoon, find a field, walk into the middle of it and then walk back.
06/08/2015, 14:59 - Joe Jarman: üòù

06/08/2015, 18:33 - Tegan: All
06/08/2015, 18:46 - Owen: I declare Monday, because then I get an extra 3 days of holiday!!
06/08/2015, 18:48 - Bongo: If tube drivers get to strike then we should be able to strike about it not being Friday
06/08/2015, 18:49 - Owen: That's how teachers do it.
06/08/2015, 19:32 - Alex Bunn: <Media omitted>

07/08/2015, 12:00 - Mike SJ: I only know because people were complaining about it on r/BritishProblems - that's where they get most of their content from :b
07/08/2015, 12:24 - Alex Bunn: Are you subscribed to r/BristishProblems? Lol
07/08/2015, 13:21 - Lorna: Its a beautiful day. Park drinks after work? üçªüåûüå≥üòÉ

07/08/2015, 15:24 - Bongo: Bloody hell
07/08/2015, 15:25 - Bongo: Can I sit on the sidelines on a deck chair drinking beer with my belly out shouting advice at you as you go past?
07/08/2015, 15:30 - Tanya: Haha please do...ill just have to make sure the person(s) next to me don't get offended. 
I looked it up and realised I'm going to be in a group of 300 women hahaha

07/08/2015, 15:58 - Sam Roberts: You're not swimming the Thames are you?
07/08/2015, 16:10 - Tanya: Yes. That's a good plan. Just need to stay a float in the THAMES (yes..crazy!)...try not to get feet caught in any tesco trolleys or in any other mysteries of the Thames :)
07/08/2015, 16:14 - Mike Joyce: If it looks like poo and smells like poo then there is no mystery there. Yes come on down and support me in my giving of support!!
07/08/2015, 16:21 - Shaggy: Haha sounds fun, ok
07/08/2015, 16:58 - Tegan: Yeesh - good luck my lovely :) you'll smash it!
07/08/2015, 17:10 - Tanya: Thanks Tigs! 
looking forward to it (as much as possible) :)
07/08/2015, 17:15 - Tegan: Are inflatables allowed? I saw a pretty smashing unicorn pool toy the other day which might add some magic to the Thames experience
07/08/2015, 17:16 - Bongo: Tie like 50 kids balloons to you during the swim so you can just paddle over people
07/08/2015, 17:16 - Bongo: To victory!
07/08/2015, 17:17 - Tegan: <Media omitted>

07/08/2015, 20:38 - Bongo: Is the strike still on?
07/08/2015, 20:38 - Bongo: That may impede my movement
07/08/2015, 20:38 - Bongo: And possibly the decision to move
07/08/2015, 20:56 - Shaggy: Indoors or outdoors?

11/08/2015, 11:20 - Bongo: Do Americans love company slogans? It feels like they do
11/08/2015, 11:22 - Shaggy: Just do it
11/08/2015, 11:23 - Mal: It's just for brand awareness and shit
11/08/2015, 11:23 - Mal: Something to focus campaigns around
11/08/2015, 11:25 - Mike SJ: We have an office in New York
11/08/2015, 11:25 - Mike SJ: They fucking love slogans
11/08/2015, 11:27 - Owen: Slogan is like naming your company twice, it's silly.
11/08/2015, 11:28 - Owen: Maybe its for when your company name doesn't make a good jingle
11/08/2015, 11:34 - Mike SJ: It's really easy to change your slogan though
11/08/2015, 11:34 - Mike SJ: Like coke and pepsi change slogans every year pretty much
11/08/2015, 11:34 - Krizia: Hey, yes is all about brand awareness and image around the company! I guess american companies do love them but its kind of old ....
11/08/2015, 11:35 - Krizia: Very 90s when big brands were building "families" as consumers
11/08/2015, 11:39 - Krizia: I guess you can have one now but is not as important as in the 90s when companies build companies reputation themselves. I guess thats why you can change the slogan as many times as needed
11/08/2015, 11:41 - Dave: Hey bongo - how about 'Blah Consultancy - we're sick at what you're shit at'
11/08/2015, 11:42 - Owen: I have a good one - 'Blah Consultancy - we won't give your children AIDs'
11/08/2015, 11:43 - Owen: That was your customers will think that all the other consultancy firms will.
11/08/2015, 11:43 - Owen: But you haven't explicitly said they will so you can't be sued for libel
11/08/2015, 12:04 - Dave: You'd be sued wheb you, inevitably, did give their children AIDS though
11/08/2015, 12:04 - Dave: Double edged sword
11/08/2015, 14:17 - Bongo: The company thread's gone a bit silly tbh, they're discussing a company song now

11/08/2015, 14:30 - Owen: Can't buy me ALFA!
11/08/2015, 14:46 - Bongo: I'd do anything for ALFA (but I won't do that) - meatloaf
11/08/2015, 14:58 - Mike SJ: Crazy stupid ALFA

27/08/2015, 17:17 - Krizia: Hahhahahahha
27/08/2015, 17:19 - Angela: Maybe emojis are Lego
27/08/2015, 17:19 - Angela: Or Simpsons
27/08/2015, 17:19 - Angela: But black Simpsons still have dark skin
27/08/2015, 17:19 - Sam Roberts: That's amazing
27/08/2015, 17:19 - Sam Roberts: Read all that and didn't get it
27/08/2015, 17:20 - Sam Roberts: It backdated when I got the new app, my phone's like a rainbow now!

27/08/2015, 18:18 - Dave: We're long gone now
27/08/2015, 18:18 - Dave: The lure of Staines is too strong
27/08/2015, 18:21 - Joe Jarman: I just googled it
27/08/2015, 18:21 - Joe Jarman: Looks like a dutch company
27/08/2015, 18:21 - Joe Jarman: But must be rented out by some London based enterprise
27/08/2015, 18:39 - Sam Roberts: <Media omitted>

27/08/2015, 19:07 - Shaggy: Omg a double rainbow, what does it mean?!
27/08/2015, 23:08 - Alex Bunn: Yo shags
27/08/2015, 23:08 - Alex Bunn: How bout adding cate to the horde
27/08/2015, 23:08 - Alex Bunn: Now she is a londoner
28/08/2015, 07:30 - Shaggy: She's not around yet?
28/08/2015, 08:13 - Dave: She's training in oxford for a few weeks then arriving in londontown
28/08/2015, 08:16 - Sam Roberts: She never lasted too long on the horde... Can't hurt to try again though
28/08/2015, 09:00 - Mal: Is it because of the unreasonable amounts of messages do you think?
28/08/2015, 09:01 - Mike SJ: Pfft, you haven't seen anything Mal
28/08/2015, 09:02 - Mike Joyce: <Media omitted>
28/08/2015, 09:02 - Mike Joyce: That was the wrong button sorrry
28/08/2015, 09:13 - Mal: Yeah this is manageable but I've heard tales
28/08/2015, 09:15 - Lorna: We need to up our game
28/08/2015, 09:16 - Mal: Haha
28/08/2015, 09:18 - Lorna: Having to read 200 messaged to find out which pub people are at is a true test of loyalty to the horde
28/08/2015, 09:22 - Shaggy: Speaking of
28/08/2015, 09:22 - Shaggy: It's been a long time since we descended on a pub
28/08/2015, 09:23 - Mike Joyce: Perhaps you need additional threads
28/08/2015, 09:23 - Mike Joyce: One for the pub
28/08/2015, 09:23 - Mike Joyce: One for meals out
28/08/2015, 09:24 - Mike Joyce: One for discussing which brand of breakfast cereal is the most smackelelicious
28/08/2015, 09:34 - Alex Bunn: Well it is friday
28/08/2015, 09:35 - Krizia: And its sunny!!! üåûüåûüåû
28/08/2015, 09:36 - Mal: Crunchy nut
28/08/2015, 09:36 - Shaggy: Clusters
28/08/2015, 09:36 - Shaggy: With berries
28/08/2015, 09:37 - Alex Bunn: Crunchy clusters are awesome boiiiiu
28/08/2015, 09:37 - Alex Bunn: Boiiii*
28/08/2015, 09:37 - Alex Bunn: (Fat thumbs)
28/08/2015, 09:38 - Shaggy: Fat-handed twat
28/08/2015, 09:39 - Mike Joyce: What about a cerial cocktail obtained by mixing multiple cerials together to become something greater then the sum of its parts?
28/08/2015, 09:40 - Mike Joyce: Or perhaps through in some bbqed meats and maple syrup for the true breakfast experience
28/08/2015, 09:41 - Mike Joyce: Instead of milk use butter
28/08/2015, 09:41 - Mike Joyce: And sprinkle cocaine on the top and douse in whiskey. Truely the breakfast of champions?
28/08/2015, 09:42 - Mike SJ: That escalated
28/08/2015, 09:43 - Mike Joyce: That's what she said
28/08/2015, 09:44 - Alex Bunn: I'll have what Joyce is having for bfast
28/08/2015, 09:45 - Mike Joyce: Cadburies cream egg and a wank
28/08/2015, 09:46 - Alex Bunn: üò®
28/08/2015, 09:47 - Mike Joyce: This is why I don't talk much
28/08/2015, 09:48 - Alex Bunn: <Media omitted>
28/08/2015, 09:55 - Sam Roberts: Yeah man, if the weather stays good that sounds awesome
28/08/2015, 09:57 - Shaggy: Meh id rather sit in a beer garden
28/08/2015, 10:11 - Alex Bunn: Its a late night thing
28/08/2015, 10:14 - Sam Roberts: I'll sit in a beer garden with you shag
28/08/2015, 10:15 - Sam Roberts: Then go dance to some biz with you Bunn! perfect Friday evening
28/08/2015, 10:15 - Alex Bunn: Well i'll come for beer garden beers too
28/08/2015, 10:21 - Owen: Shabong, can I come to yours sometime Sunday to pick up arduinos.
28/08/2015, 10:35 - Sam Roberts: Oh! Bbq in c town Sunday
28/08/2015, 10:36 - Sam Roberts: Browen, I was thinking some garden games around midday for board game club, then big meat in the evening?
28/08/2015, 10:43 - Owen: Board game club is the weekend after. But I don't see why we couldn't play a cheeky coup.
28/08/2015, 10:46 - Bongo: Coups are always cheeky, there's no need to explicitly say it
28/08/2015, 10:49 - Mal: BBQ in c town?
28/08/2015, 10:49 - Mal: No can do
28/08/2015, 10:49 - Mal: Monday, surely
28/08/2015, 10:50 - Tegan: Monday is carnival day
28/08/2015, 10:50 - Mike SJ: My brother is down, he's basically a bbq god
28/08/2015, 10:50 - Mike SJ: Not sure he can do Monday
28/08/2015, 10:50 - Tegan: What isn't Niall a god of, though?
28/08/2015, 10:55 - Mal: Both days are carnival days
28/08/2015, 10:56 - Tegan: Obvs. Going on Monday though.
28/08/2015, 10:56 - Mal: Nah too risky
28/08/2015, 10:56 - Mal: I'm going to be mangled
28/08/2015, 10:57 - Mal: Tuesday is a work day
28/08/2015, 10:57 - Tegan: Fair enough
28/08/2015, 10:57 - Mal: Last year I couldn't have worked on Monday!
28/08/2015, 10:59 - Mal: Basically because carnival was followed by squat parties then a rave in the woods
28/08/2015, 10:59 - Mal: On the Sunday
28/08/2015, 11:00 - Tegan: To be fair, it sounds like you're planning to have a much cooler time than me
28/08/2015, 11:01 - Mal: Well the coolness was basically due to the unexpected spontaneity
28/08/2015, 11:01 - Mal: I was going home until this guy said to come into our party!
28/08/2015, 11:02 - Tegan: Your expectations are totally raised now, though
28/08/2015, 11:02 - Tegan: Sunday can only disappoint
28/08/2015, 11:02 - Tegan: Making Monday the only viable option
28/08/2015, 11:07 - Mal: It was all about being on the edge though
28/08/2015, 11:09 - Mal: To e hones today and tomorrow have session written all over them so Sunday may well be needed to wind down haha
28/08/2015, 11:09 - Mal: Keeping it organic
28/08/2015, 11:14 - Tegan: I'm not street enough to continue this conversation
28/08/2015, 11:14 - Tegan: Out :)
28/08/2015, 11:14 - Mike SJ: 2street4me
28/08/2015, 11:15 - Alex Bunn: Doing well to clock up the message spam today
28/08/2015, 11:15 - Shaggy: So what pub?
28/08/2015, 11:16 - Mal: I got "organic" from Archer, the edge was literal as in "the edge of the area on whih carnival is being staged". And the rest are typos.
28/08/2015, 11:16 - Tegan: :)
28/08/2015, 11:17 - Mal: <Media omitted>
28/08/2015, 11:19 - Alex Bunn: @shaggy don't mind what pub
28/08/2015, 11:19 - Alex Bunn: Outdoor drinking essential
28/08/2015, 11:19 - Alex Bunn: Roebuck?
28/08/2015, 11:20 - Shaggy: Ooo love that place
28/08/2015, 11:21 - Mal: IF the outdoor bit is essential, why pay ¬£5 for pints when you can go to, say, primrose hill, London fields etc, an drink for 1/5 of the price?
28/08/2015, 11:22 - Shaggy: Grass is wet
28/08/2015, 11:22 - Mal: I doubt that
28/08/2015, 11:22 - Shaggy: 100%
28/08/2015, 11:22 - Shaggy: Concrete isn't dry yet from all the rain
28/08/2015, 11:22 - Alex Bunn: Lol you are funny shags
28/08/2015, 11:23 - Alex Bunn: It'll be dry by lunch
28/08/2015, 11:23 - Mal: It won't be by 6. And the concrete here is well dry
28/08/2015, 11:23 - Mal: I've never seen such dry concrete
28/08/2015, 11:24 - Shaggy: You ain't seen nothin'
28/08/2015, 11:24 - Mal: And I've been to Vegas, Rajasthan and Kuwait
28/08/2015, 11:24 - Mal: This concrete is dryer than. All
28/08/2015, 11:24 - Shaggy: They can't afford rain in those countries
28/08/2015, 11:24 - Shaggy: So no way
28/08/2015, 11:25 - Mal: Kuwait is basically made of money
28/08/2015, 11:26 - Mal: The minimum withdrawal Fromm a cashpoint was equivelan to ¬£40!!
28/08/2015, 11:28 - Mal: To be fair I have a work shindig so it is no skin off my nose, I just can't bear to see people waste money
28/08/2015, 11:34 - Alex Bunn: I think the friday evening pub experience is necessary tonight
28/08/2015, 11:49 - Sam Roberts: I'm in for real beer and seats
28/08/2015, 11:49 - Sam Roberts: Parks are more a midday session to my mind
28/08/2015, 11:50 - Mal: You have 8-10 cold, wet months for real beer and seats
28/08/2015, 11:50 - Sam Roberts: For frolicking and frisbee
28/08/2015, 11:50 - Sam Roberts: Can't wait
28/08/2015, 11:50 - Mal: Also, pubs don't sell zywiec haha
28/08/2015, 11:50 - Sam Roberts: Can we go somewhere with special brew on tap?
28/08/2015, 11:50 - Shaggy: Spoons have tyskie
28/08/2015, 11:50 - Shaggy: Same thing
28/08/2015, 11:51 - Mal: Spoons used to have zywiec and lech, tyskie is unfortunately not the same
28/08/2015, 11:51 - Sam Roberts: Alright, this is where all the girls roll their eyes, but I ‚ù§ spoons
28/08/2015, 11:52 - Mal: Like saying carling and kronenbourg are the same
28/08/2015, 11:52 - Sam Roberts: Cheap beer, soft padding and the only atmosphere is the one you bring with you
28/08/2015, 11:52 - Mal: Yeah basically the world needs more cheap chain pubs haha
28/08/2015, 11:52 - Mal: If independent pubs won't be cheap, fuck off and be replaced by a leviathan of commerce like JD
28/08/2015, 11:55 - Sam Roberts: Roebuck then?
28/08/2015, 11:55 - Shaggy: Carling and kronenbourg have 1% objective difference, tyskie and zywiec do not
28/08/2015, 11:57 - Alex Bunn: Who wanted mountains of messages discussing where to drink?
28/08/2015, 11:57 - Alex Bunn: Objective complete
28/08/2015, 11:58 - Sam Roberts: I felt like Lorna was missing it
28/08/2015, 11:58 - Mal: Well at least now I know shaggy has no taste buds, when it's my round I know who's getting the drip tray remnants!
28/08/2015, 12:04 - Shaggy: You can try, but I'll know straight away it's diluted
28/08/2015, 12:06 - Mal: Haha I wouldn't do it. Years ago when I worked at lords, home of rich cunts and money, we were actually told to incorporate that shit into the pre pours
28/08/2015, 12:06 - Mal: Must be illegal
28/08/2015, 12:14 - Shaggy: Woah amazing
28/08/2015, 12:34 - Mal: It must be swimming in bacteria!
28/08/2015, 12:37 - Shaggy: Good for your immune system
28/08/2015, 12:37 - Shaggy: Bad for you sphincter
28/08/2015, 13:09 - Lorna: 144 messages since this morning, not bad guys üëçüèª
28/08/2015, 13:10 - Mal: The last one before that was the best going
28/08/2015, 13:10 - Mal: Simply "bad for your sphincter"
28/08/2015, 13:10 - Lorna: Also yes to pub and edge-based carnivaling!
28/08/2015, 13:12 - Mal: Weather will also be good insha'allah ‚òùÔ∏è
28/08/2015, 13:12 - Lorna: Except Sunday right? Sposed to rain
28/08/2015, 13:12 - Mal: Nah
28/08/2015, 13:12 - Mal: I mean yeah, but it will n rain
28/08/2015, 13:13 - Mal: Not.
28/08/2015, 13:13 - Mal: Don't trust weather forecasts, 4 summers of working on a beach taught me that
28/08/2015, 13:50 - Shaggy: What time do you want to converge? Would be good to catch some sun
28/08/2015, 15:04 - Bongo: Where are converging?
28/08/2015, 15:04 - Bongo: Ldn bridge?
28/08/2015, 15:07 - Owen: Yeah, what time and where.
28/08/2015, 15:07 - Owen: I like this whole ldn brg thing as that isn't a 5 hour trek to shoreditch.
28/08/2015, 15:08 - Alex Bunn: The roebuck after work
28/08/2015, 15:08 - Alex Bunn: Yeah?
28/08/2015, 15:28 - Lora: +1 for Roebuck! üíÅüèº

28/08/2015, 18:02 - Sam Roberts: But hey, we decided on a pub
28/08/2015, 18:02 - Sam Roberts: Literally the most productive day on the horde ever
28/08/2015, 18:06 - Owen: Which pub?
28/08/2015, 18:06 - Owen: And is it near London Bridge? Because that is where I am currently headed.
28/08/2015, 18:06 - Lorna: On my way! Its the roebuck.
28/08/2015, 18:07 - Lorna: Which is nearer borough, but still close to lb
