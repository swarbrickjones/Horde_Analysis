"11 Oct 12:19 2013","Hmm, I see what you mean. I find that Stewart Lee is like good horror, the comedy is often in what he doesn't say and how you fill it in. He's very theatrical but bit in a camp way and he's true to his comic roots and honest. I think he's really funny. But that's just me... X","Dave"

"11 Oct 12:31 2013","Mike will advise. His episodes 'Stewart Lee's comedy vehicle' are good and his show If You Prefer A Milder Comedian Please Ask For One is great, especially the cider part at the end. X","Dave"
"11 Oct 12:42 2013","I've seen his show where he talks about Cameron, I think it was funny, if a bit odd, but I also think that most his humour was lost on my ignorant self","Shaggy"

"13 Dec 18:50 2013","Prices?  Availability. And did you see the memo? All messages need to be sent with a tps report. So if you could go ahead and fill that out, that'd be great","Sam"

"14 Dec 11:28 2013","No coach. Also was that £26.50 each way?. If so the train is cheaper.","Owen"
"14 Dec 11:28 2013","Not each way, return. Coach is definitely cheaper","Shaggy"
"14 Dec 11:30 2013","The 2:45pm from Paddington takes 1hr20. Flexible return. Winner.. Screw that. It's to parkway.","Marth"
"14 Dec 11:30 2013","Even with 30 mins walk it's still less than the coach","Shaggy"

"29 Dec 13:12 2013","Brown. What's the closest station?","Cate"
"29 Dec 13:15 2013","I don't know.  Sam said something about trains. I liked the idea of hiring a car, but then again I can't drive and mainly liked the idea of getting drunk with shaggy distracting the driver until we careered into a hedge.","Owen"
"29 Dec 13:20 2013","One car and some people on trains, I think you were down for car-ing?","Sam"
"29 Dec 13:24 2013","Car would be great if there are people happy to drive. Phil, are you still game? X","Dave"
"29 Dec 13:28 2013","Since we can't stay on the first wouldn't it be best for everyone to go by car?","Owen"
"29 Dec 13:47 2013","Owen makes a lot of sense. Also Sam, what train station would we go to?","Cate"
"29 Dec 13:49 2013","Last time we went to brokenhurst broklesby","Dave"
"29 Dec 13:49 2013","Seriously?!","Cate"

"29 Dec 13:50 2013","That place name like my name!!. No. No it isn't. As you were...","Cate"
"29 Dec 13:51 2013","Heh, too much excitment. Are you training or carrying cate?. Urg, carring","Dave"
"29 Dec 13:55 2013","Could get two cars, I'd prefer train though tbh, trains are fine on the 1st, about 2 hours to waterloo every half hour. Cars a bit cheaper, trains are nicer","Sam"
"29 Dec 14:04 2013","What was the price for two cars? Did tegan look into that last time? I can drive. Also. We have accumulated two bags of unidentified clothing in our house. If you think you might own some of these items please come and pick them up before i chuck them out in a couple of weeks time","Bunn"
"29 Dec 14:24 2013","Marth reckoned that two cars with four in each would be around 34 quid each.. How many are going?","Dave"
"29 Dec 14:33 2013","13 I think, 7 seater an option?","Sam"
"29 Dec 14:41 2013","Could get a couple of 7s. Marth worked it out as 46 each that way.","Dave"
"29 Dec 14:51 2013","I'm already training it. The station in arriving at is called Lymington Town. Is that right Sam?. Bunny is there a dark red herringbone bomber jacket in there?","Vanessa"
"29 Dec 15:04 2013","Don't we need at least one car to get us from brocksbursy leminghurst town (or whatever its called) to sam's?","Owen"
"29 Dec 15:04 2013","Could taxi","Dave"
"29 Dec 15:08 2013","I'm arriving at around 10pm so I'll figure it out when I get there","Vanessa"
"29 Dec 15:22 2013","Probably taxi for v then, which leaves a 7 and a 5, or a 7 and 5 by train. Def need one car, mainly for ease / booze runs / flexibility. Station is lymington, or Brockenhurst. Brock is a bit further but easier trains, lymington is 1 more change. So depends on whether whoever's driving is up for a slightly longer pickup *lascivious wink at marth*","Sam"
"29 Dec 15:23 2013","Me and eliza will do the same thing as you sam.","Owen"
"29 Dec 15:24 2013","Awesome sauce, we can plan pranks to play on Bunny","Sam"

"29 Dec 22:23 2013","Just catching up on these messages, is everyone heading down tomorrow or tues?","Bongo"
"29 Dec 23:00 2013","31st, guess that's Tuesday. That leaves 2 seats in the car? Also can team shagmarth be in charge of sorting that out?","Sam"
"29 Dec 23:07 2013","I guess I'll train it down with you lot in the day then.. Those clothes are mine btw, I'll take them off your hands next time I'm round.","Bongo"
"30 Dec 11:58 2013","Why is there a train crew if we all have to be back at the same time? All in car makes more sense","Shaggy"
"30 Dec 11:59 2013","I would rather go by car, is there room in a car for me? X","Cate"
"30 Dec 11:59 2013","And it's an aweful long way to go for one night anyway. Just sayin","Shaggy"

"30 Dec 12:45 2013","I'm easy,  anywhere with all you beautiful people and some tunes is good for me. Ideally some naughty salts as well, anyone got some thoughts on that. ?","Sam"
"30 Dec 12:48 2013","I guess that it is a bit of a mission if we're off the next day. Would have been great to see the sea though.","Dave"
"30 Dec 12:49 2013","In this weather you might as well squint your eyes and look at the ripples on the puddles in our garden","Shaggy"
"30 Dec 12:50 2013","Heh, perhaps I can take a trip out on your garden boat.","Dave"
"30 Dec 12:50 2013","Point taken- it's not really the weather for a walk.  Let's visit the sea in the spring time.","Tegan"
"30 Dec 12:52 2013","You'll have to fight the foxes first. Thinking about food and people, phil / marth, you know some roast stuff we can have cold? Like, do a ham in the morning maybe?. And can you do veggies for the veggies dave?","Sam"
"30 Dec 12:53 2013","Roast red peppers are great cold","Dave"
"30 Dec 12:54 2013","Ok this seems to be gathering momentum. Lets see what everyone else says. What would have been spent on travel can be spent on more food. Vanessa will be reimbursed cos she's already bought a train ticket","Bunn"
"30 Dec 12:55 2013","I've also got a bottle of vodka and rum ready to be cracked open!","Vanessa"

"30 Dec 13:16 2013","Is anyone not up for relocation to c town?","Dave"
"30 Dec 13:35 2013","Owen and I are fine either way.","Eliza"
"30 Dec 16:06 2013","Damn, seriously? I agree, a lot cheaper, but cottage last year was sooooo epic","Marth"
"30 Dec 16:08 2013","Agreed but I'd say cos of the people, not the place","Sam"
"30 Dec 16:17 2013","7 reasons why: (1) disco room, separated with a curtain from (2) awesome chill out room with more sofas than a room ever needs pushed into a circle, with (3) disco lights. (4) a kitchen with a table we sit and play cards around and eat around that's not covered with crap. (5) a garden to chill out in intermittently throughout the evening, where we're less likely to get stabbed, and (6) a clean, comfy bed with fresh sheets to lay your head on when the sun is rising and your body is blissfully fragile. And (7) the coast of England to enjoy with close friends and a glass of orange juice on New Year's Day. Yay?","Marth"
"30 Dec 16:23 2013","Yay!","Cate"
"30 Dec 16:25 2013","Awww, Marth, you're such a poet! I'm easy either way x","Tegan"

"30 Dec 17:00 2013","I'm getting way more into the idea of c-town by the minute!. We've got twice the people as last year, and we'll have the place all nice for you ladies","Sam"
"30 Dec 17:01 2013","Fancy a hand getting it ready tonight? Perhaps in testing the sofa out.","Dave"
"30 Dec 17:03 2013","Hehe in my experience that rarely ends in the place getting tidier!","Sam"
"30 Dec 17:04 2013","You can trust me...","Dave"

"07 Jan 15:56 2014","Science time! Give us 3 films you really like, and 3 you really don't.  Newer films would be better, and no cheating!","Sam"
"07 Jan 16:04 2014","I had a browse already: rush was a great film, 89 is perhaps overrated but I'll let it slide. Snatch is 73 which I think is too low, it's certainly a million times better than rush, but perhaps it's an old film. Pitch black, that came out same time as snatch, is 57 and a failure? Well that's bullshit, it's an excellent film. I know exactly the soppy heart wrenching and gut warming films they would rate highly and it's not at all aligned to my tastes","Shaggy"
"07 Jan 16:15 2014","Eurgh. Shaddap already. This is not bants","Bunn"
"07 Jan 16:15 2014","That's bad testing! It means nothing if you do it blind, you're basically saying you found 3 films you kind of agree with","Sam"
"07 Jan 16:16 2014","No1 cares about your moanig shaggy. Moaning*","Bunn"
"07 Jan 16:18 2014","Also 57% is very close to fresh. The only problem I have with rotten tomatoes is the binary nature of fresh/rotten.  If you just go by percentage instead it is more accurate.","Owen"
"07 Jan 16:18 2014","Pitch black was a solid 57, enjoyable but not particularly great","Sam"
"07 Jan 16:18 2014","No one cares about *your* moaning bunn","Shaggy"

"07 Jan 16:22 2014","No because that would assume I have knowledge of what is and isn't, and I don't. I picked a film I watched recently, a film I know is excellent and a film I know I would enjoy","Shaggy"

"14 Jan 18:36 2014","Good question Hannah. Touching on deep and important issues.","Tegan"

"14 Jan 18:46 2014","A lot of danger of getting chomped","Bunn"

"14 Jan 18:47 2014","Like an armadillo. Is also negative banter","Tegan"
"14 Jan 18:48 2014","I guess if everyone got asked the question and made a choice. Then if they disnt have a mouth full of pubes. It would be safe to assume they went for the teeth for pubes option. And you could have weird teeth crunching sex","Bunn"

"24 Mar 13:46 2014","There are two proofs.  One of which uses the reimann zeta function.","Owen"
"24 Mar 13:52 2014","Lol, bad horde chat. If you analytically continue the Riemann zeta function and evaluate at -1 that's what you get. Kinda cheating though. As written the series is clearly divergent.","Mike"
"24 Mar 13:59 2014","I don't really get what makes a series divegent though. Because 1/1+1/2+1/3 +1/4... is divergent. Even though it feels like it shouldn't be.. Why is it cheating?","Owen"
"24 Mar 14:06 2014","This is quite complicated... Zeta(x) is well defined for real x>1. For x<= 1 the series is not convergent. There's a thing called analytic continuation where roughly you find a function which agrees with your function where it is defined and is analytic (read infinitely differentiable) on a compact subset of the complex numbers.. But the analytic continuation is not the same as the original function. So it doesn't make sense to use the series definition of zeta for x<1 and say zeta(-1) = 1+2+3+....","Mike"
"24 Mar 14:10 2014","That is what they guy did in the video.  He did zeta(2) and then took away 2.zeta (-2) or something.  I forget exactly how he did it. It feels like cheating.","Owen"

"24 Mar 14:16 2014","Nah. Let the prols that inhabit this thread learn something.. Also apparently 1-1+1-1+1-1.... is divergent.  Which makes no sense!","Owen"
"24 Mar 14:24 2014","Well it doesn't converge to anything. Depending on how you cluster the sums it appears it could converge to 0 or 1. In general for an infinite series to be convergent the underlying sequence being summed must converge to zero.","Dave"

"03 Apr 09:56 2014","Cheers Marth. God bless the facts. X","Dave"
"03 Apr 10:08 2014","Interesting. Apparently like 70% people think farage won the debate according to the guardian.. I personally don't care. I just don't think that in a democracy politicians really have that much power. Gove is trying his best to fuck up education and still isn't really making a dent.","Owen"
"03 Apr 10:32 2014","From all accounts I'm reading Andrew Lansley's Health and Social Care Act has essentially privatised the NHS. I'd keep my eyes on politicians - it's when we stop watching them that the shit hits the fan.","Dave"
"03 Apr 10:34 2014","What yah gonna do. As long as I don't have to pay for health insurance.. Which I never will. If any politician suggested such a thing there would be a recall election or a vote of no confidence.","Owen"

"03 Apr 11:53 2014","Thanks!","Vanessa"
"03 Apr 18:38 2014","Thanks for the link Marth. My gut definitely says it would be dumb to leave the EU, but all the arguments I see either for or against it seem very vague and notional.... Also I reckon the yougov poll was probly skewed by the fact that people hate clegg","Mike"
"03 Apr 19:16 2014","I would like to see stats on how much import and export tax is saved by being in the EU.. Also I think the reasons for being part of it are vague and complicated whereas the reasons for not being part basically boil down to saving a small amount of money and stopping immigration.. I am fairly sure I am pro EU not because of its benefits (I don't really know what they are) but because I don't think the arguments against it are compelling. I am basically anti xenophobe. And apparently included in that set is being pro European union.","Owen"
"03 Apr 20:07 2014","I am pro eu because I fully dig passing through Borders with no problems. Liberte! Egalite! Fraternite!. (No accents, sorry French)","Tegan"
"03 Apr 20:13 2014","I agree with you. That seems like a pretty small reason. I am fairly sure the EU is actually fairly inconsequential though.","Owen"
"03 Apr 20:14 2014","It feels like the closest thing to idealism which we still have a commitment to","Tegan"
"03 Apr 21:29 2014","Arguing against the eu just feels like xenophobic atavism, I'd love it if there were poignant arguments for Britain to be a member for itself, but I feel completely happy with the idea that we make a net loss, with a huge gain in other countries. Looking over the history of colonial Britain, I think we owe the world a bit","Sam"
"03 Apr 21:35 2014","The only way human society can overcome the worlds problems (environment, war, inequality, crime, etc) is through political globalisation. The eu is a big step in that direction. Even if Britain gained did gain by leaving the eu, theres bigger issues at play here than just being 1 or 2% wealthier.. Anyone around for post work beers tomorrow night?","Alan"
"03 Apr 21:35 2014","I don't know that immigration is good for other countries though. Seems like a lot of poorer countries lose a lot of bright people that way","Mike"

"28 May 11:05 2014","Actually I never saw that I always assumed it was rubbish","Henry"
"28 May 11:06 2014","Get past the first few episodes, which try to copy the uk one, and then it gets going and is really funny","Angela"
"28 May 11:10 2014","It was some very subtle trolling Sam. I kept just thinking my fingers had got fatter or something.. Yeah once you get to the second series it is a lot better.. The first series just try to copy the British one. But because they are American they don't seem to get the humor.","Owen"

"28 May 13:51 2014","I think audiophiles are kidding themselves though. Its like high end wine tasting.","Mike"
"28 May 14:00 2014","I'm pretty sure it's just what your used to, going back to computer speakers when you've been listening to real ones for a little while is painful, you never realise how bad the quality is. And I'll never forgive Vanessa for educating me about burgers. Now I know what they're supposed to taste like, I can't even finish a McDonald's","Sam"

"04 Jun 16:03 2014","Yep.. I have to prepare an analysis for it. But the way some of the data is stored is in cell formatting. So I'm going to have to write a format checking VB macro.

"13 Jul 12:53 2014","What area people's plans for the game?","Tegan"
"13 Jul 13:23 2014","I was going to do what everyone else was doing!. It would be good to find a german or argentinian pub. I think German is more likely","Owen"
"13 Jul 14:08 2014","How was that hackney venue with the mega screen?. Though its great weather for a BBQ...","Lorna"
"13 Jul 14:25 2014","Hackney venue was pretty chilled last time, might be more happening for the final. They also had a terrible beer selection. Massive screen though","Tegan"
"13 Jul 14:37 2014","I'm not too fussed tbh, I didn't want to see either of these teams play","Bongo"
"13 Jul 14:38 2014","Come to ours!. Cant be arsed to go out to watch the final. Have so little enthusiasm for germany or argentina","Bunn"
"13 Jul 14:39 2014","I think it's unlikely to be a stunning game, given the standard of football so far","Tegan"
"13 Jul 14:57 2014","I think Germany have the potential to make something exciting happen. Like 7-1","Owen"
"13 Jul 15:07 2014","Yeah, like 7-1 to Argentina! Ha, smack talk.","Lorna"
"13 Jul 15:16 2014","I don't get why people dont think this will be a good game. It is by definition the two best teams in the world!","Owen"
"13 Jul 16:05 2014","I guess you didnt watch the last 2 world cups finals. Best remembered for Zidane's headbutt, De Jong's flying kick on Alonso. And Van Basten hacking all the Spaniards to pieces. Could be a good match if they actually play","Bunn"
"13 Jul 16:43 2014","The Germans don't play dirty.  And Messi doesn't dive...","Tegan"

"18 Sep 00:24 2014","I'm about 1/4 of the way through my book. I have got the basics and am now using fragments. It's a pretty neat setup. Very scalable, but that means that you have to do quite a lot for even the simplest app. Fortunately android released a development  kit pre bundled with eclipse which takes away loads of the legwork  that existed when android was first  released. I haven't  looked into unity, mainly because I don't have an apple. What's  it like?","Owen"

"18 Sep 09:03 2014","I didn't think I was bothered but actually I would be a bit sad if they voted yes. Like being dumped by someone I completely took for granted all these years","Angela"
"18 Sep 09:05 2014","Lol. And all those cyclists. Damn. 55% no, that's my bet","Mike"
"18 Sep 09:06 2014","Cyclists?","Sam"
"18 Sep 09:06 2014","Reckon 52% no - a bit too close for comfort","Marth"
"18 Sep 09:07 2014","I'm not sure I care about the really. The important thing is it sets the stage for Cornish independence, which is way overdue. *result. They actually have their own currency, take that Scotland","Sam"
"18 Sep 09:09 2014","Yeah think about all those gold medals we got in the cycling!. I reckon no's are underreporting. I'd be surprised by a yes vote","Mike"
"18 Sep 09:13 2014","I agree, I think 55% at least for no","Angela"
"18 Sep 09:20 2014","I think I would be happy either way: excited for an independent Scotland, content to see an island united.. The underreporting point is true though the polls may not be very reliable. There was a chap from yougov on the radio the other day saying that polls are usually weighted to control for the way they are sampled however this process requires historical data","Dave"
"18 Sep 09:20 2014","There's no exit polls! Bullshit, where's the fun in that?","Mike"
"18 Sep 09:20 2014","There isn't any such data for this referendum but the weighting process has been done anyway which can skew the results","Dave"
"18 Sep 09:24 2014","Ungrateful Scots costing us a fortune yes or no, best just to cull the lot of em. Off to collect my dole money  EMOJI[1f609] ","Joe"
"18 Sep 09:25 2014","You know betfair have already paid out on no? Thats pretty cocky...","Mike"
"18 Sep 09:26 2014","While they weight the results for sampling, they can't weight them for people lying. All the polls in 1992 predicted a labour win but it turned out that voting conservative was so uncool that people just didn't want to admit to it","Angela"
"18 Sep 09:26 2014","What happens if it's yes? Do they have to return the money?","Dave"
"18 Sep 09:27 2014","Probably voting no is seen as boring but actually people do want the safer option?","Angela"
"18 Sep 09:28 2014","I'm for a yes vote","Bunn"
"18 Sep 09:28 2014","Maybe, bit I wonder how many people, when in the ballot box, will let the excitement take over and change to yes","Dave"
"18 Sep 09:31 2014","I bet they could have a more progressive country if they cut London loose. Great Britain is renamed, not-so-great-anymore Britain","Bunn"
"18 Sep 09:32 2014","I think the contrary actually happens in the ballot box a lot of people take the safe option or they change right there!","Krizia"

"18 Sep 10:12 2014","People keep ignoring the big issues. Do we still get to claim someone from the uk won Wimbledon?","Mike"
"18 Sep 10:12 2014","Will they? That depends on  a lot of factors: Import  and export tax between England and Scotland, whether the new scoring government  decides to subsidise whiskey, EU trade rules.","Owen"
"18 Sep 10:14 2014","It won't go down","Sam"
"18 Sep 10:14 2014","It also depends on whether we decide to put Hadrian's wall back up","Mike"
"18 Sep 10:14 2014","We're only losing Hoy, and without the superior british bikes and training, he'll dwindle to a hollowed has been","Sam"
"18 Sep 10:22 2014","He'll dwindle to a hollowed has been anyway. Ha!. Ageing. I think claiming Andy Murray as our own has been a gigantic push for Scottish independence","Bunn"
"18 Sep 10:25 2014","It could go down sam. It is a big industry. Wouldn't be suprised if a Scotland in charge of thier own economy decide to subsidise it loads. That coupled with EU trade laws would mean no export tax to Britain.. France subsidise thier wine industry considerably.","Owen"
