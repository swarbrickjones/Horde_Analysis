12:13, 11 Oct 2013 - Dave Mendez: Ah, how about on the Tuesday? Anyone...
12:14, 11 Oct 2013 - Bunn: Hi Dave. Not really a big fan of Stewart Lees rants. I guess i'm not his audience
12:15, 11 Oct 2013 - Bunn: Unless you can change my mind
12:16, 11 Oct 2013 - Slam: Don't think I've seen any of his biz, I love standup though,  I'll geek up a bit this weekend n maybe get a ticket!
12:16, 11 Oct 2013 - Bunn: Its not your typical standup! (There are no jokes)
12:19, 11 Oct 2013 - Dave Mendez: Hmm, I see what you mean. I find that Stewart Lee is like good horror, the comedy is often in what he doesn't say and how you fill it in. He's very theatrical but bit in a camp way and he's true to his comic roots and honest. I think he's really funny. But that's just me... X
12:20, 11 Oct 2013 - Bunn: We'll watch some tonight a la casa and decide
12:22, 11 Oct 2013 - Dave Mendez: That seems fair. Let me know your conclusions. X

12:25, 11 Oct 2013 - Bunn: Ps. Shaggy add bongo!
12:25, 11 Oct 2013 - Bunn: So we can rinse him
12:31, 11 Oct 2013 - Dave Mendez: Mike will advise. His episodes 'Stewart Lee's comedy vehicle' are good and his show If You Prefer A Milder Comedian Please Ask For One is great, especially the cider part at the end. X
12:42, 11 Oct 2013 - Shaggy Crazy Horse: I've seen his show where he talks about Cameron, I think it was funny, if a bit odd, but I also think that most his humour was lost on my ignorant self
12:43, 11 Oct 2013 - Bunn: I think it takes a while to 'get' him
12:47, 11 Oct 2013 - p tschismarov: His show about cameron was weak sauce no matter how long you watched it. Maybe his other stuff is better though.
12:58, 11 Oct 2013 - Bunn: Dayum. Sexy Spanish girl in pret just gave me a badass wink and grin
12:58, 11 Oct 2013 - Bunn: Awww yeah

22:27, 28 Dec 2013 - Bunn: Need to start asking around for md
22:28, 28 Dec 2013 - Bunn: Do we need to worry/make preparations for the storm thats coming in?
22:36, 28 Dec 2013 - Dave Mendez: I'll bring ropes for tying down the house. What would you do without me?
22:39, 28 Dec 2013 - Teegan: Is Shaggy at all enlightened?
22:39, 28 Dec 2013 - Slam: I'd panic dave. Panic and lose my house
22:52, 28 Dec 2013 - Vanessa "Beast" Matthews: Storm? Again?
22:53, 28 Dec 2013 - Bunn: Appaz. Although i havnt seen any news or weather and im going on rumours
22:54, 28 Dec 2013 - Vanessa "Beast" Matthews: Appaz? Is that the name of it?
22:57, 28 Dec 2013 - Bunn: Lol. I meant apparently but i shortened it cos im totes amaze
23:03, 28 Dec 2013 - Teegan: Might bugger up the trains
23:03, 28 Dec 2013 - Teegan: Sorry, bug up the trs
23:29, 28 Dec 2013 - Slam: Bgr p th trns
23:29, 28 Dec 2013 - Slam: I got that first time bunn
23:31, 28 Dec 2013 - Bunn: Thats cos ur cool
23:35, 28 Dec 2013 - Slam: I don't know if it's cool or if we've spent so long living together that our menstrual cycles wre in line
23:55, 28 Dec 2013 - Bunn: I can believe that
23:55, 28 Dec 2013 - Bunn: But according to Spaced. Men are supposed to have this unspoken understanding of how to act out a gunfight
23:55, 28 Dec 2013 - Bunn: Which is a bit cooler than syncronised bleeding
09:56, 29 Dec 2013 - p tschismarov: If a gunfight erupts I'll use you as a human shield and then sell your remains to a cat food company.
10:03, 29 Dec 2013 - Bunn: Good to know you're on my side
10:03, 29 Dec 2013 - Bunn: Sneaky Austrian
10:03, 29 Dec 2013 - Bunn: Aren't you supposed to go Arnie?
10:04, 29 Dec 2013 - Bunn: And stand solo with a minigun in the heart of battle
10:04, 29 Dec 2013 - Bunn: And destroy everything in sight?
11:58, 29 Dec 2013 - Owen James: Are we getting trains now? Also what colour is my name on wassap?
13:12, 29 Dec 2013 - Cate: Brown. What's the closest station?
13:15, 29 Dec 2013 - Owen James: I don't know.  Sam said something about trains. I liked the idea of hiring a car, but then again I can't drive and mainly liked the idea of getting drunk with shaggy distracting the driver until we careered into a hedge.
13:20, 29 Dec 2013 - Slam: One car and some people on trains, I think you were down for car-ing?
13:24, 29 Dec 2013 - Dave Mendez: Car would be great if there are people happy to drive. Phil, are you still game? X
13:28, 29 Dec 2013 - Owen James: Since we can't stay on the first wouldn't it be best for everyone to go by car?
13:47, 29 Dec 2013 - Cate: Owen makes a lot of sense. Also Sam, what train station would we go to?
13:49, 29 Dec 2013 - Dave Mendez: Last time we went to brokenhurst broklesby
13:49, 29 Dec 2013 - Cate: Seriously?!
13:49, 29 Dec 2013 - Dave Mendez: Brockenhurst even
13:49, 29 Dec 2013 - Cate: That place name like my name!!
13:50, 29 Dec 2013 - Cate: No. No it isn't. As you were...
13:50, 29 Dec 2013 - Dave Mendez: Heh, too much excitment
13:50, 29 Dec 2013 - Dave Mendez: Are you training or carrying cate?
13:51, 29 Dec 2013 - Dave Mendez: Urg, carring
13:55, 29 Dec 2013 - Slam: Could get two cars, I'd prefer train though tbh, trains are fine on the 1st, about 2 hours to waterloo every half hour. Cars a bit cheaper, trains are nicer
14:03, 29 Dec 2013 - Bunn: What was the price for two cars? Did tegan look into that last time? I can drive
14:04, 29 Dec 2013 - Bunn: Also. We have accumulated two bags of unidentified clothing in our house. If you think you might own some of these items please come and pick them up before i chuck them out in a couple of weeks time
14:24, 29 Dec 2013 - Dave Mendez: Marth reckoned that two cars with four in each would be around 34 quid each.
14:24, 29 Dec 2013 - Dave Mendez: How many are going?
14:33, 29 Dec 2013 - Slam: 13 I think, 7 seater an option?
14:41, 29 Dec 2013 - Dave Mendez: Could get a couple of 7s. Marth worked it out as 46 each that way.
14:50, 29 Dec 2013 - Vanessa "Beast" Matthews: I'm already training it. The station in arriving at is called Lymington Town. Is that right Sam?
14:51, 29 Dec 2013 - Vanessa "Beast" Matthews: Bunny is there a dark red herringbone bomber jacket in there?
15:04, 29 Dec 2013 - Owen James: Don't we need at least one car to get us from brocksbursy leminghurst town (or whatever its called) to sam's?
15:04, 29 Dec 2013 - Dave Mendez: Could taxi
15:08, 29 Dec 2013 - Vanessa "Beast" Matthews: I'm arriving at around 10pm so I'll figure it out when I get there
15:20, 29 Dec 2013 - Slam: Probably taxi for v then, which leaves a 7 and a 5, or a 7 and 5 by train
15:20, 29 Dec 2013 - Slam: Def need one car, mainly for ease / booze runs / flexibility
15:21, 29 Dec 2013 - Slam: Station is lymington, or Brockenhurst. Brock is a bit further but easier trains, lymington is 1 more change
15:22, 29 Dec 2013 - Slam: So depends on whether whoever's driving is up for a slightly longer pickup *lascivious wink at marth*
15:23, 29 Dec 2013 - Owen James: Me and eliza will do the same thing as you sam.
15:24, 29 Dec 2013 - Slam: Awesome sauce, we can plan pranks to play on Bunny
15:24, 29 Dec 2013 - Dave Mendez: You're walking aren't you Sam?
15:24, 29 Dec 2013 - Owen James: Scratch that... we will do the same thang as whoever has the keys to the house.
15:24, 29 Dec 2013 - Slam: I bought a unicycle just for this!
15:25, 29 Dec 2013 - Owen James: Well add mine and eliza's unicycles and you will have a tricycle.  Just like a grown up little boy.
15:28, 29 Dec 2013 - Shaggy Crazy Horse: Wazzzzuuuuuuuuuuiuup
15:29, 29 Dec 2013 - Slam: Sup
15:30, 29 Dec 2013 - Owen James: Hi shaggy.
15:30, 29 Dec 2013 - Slam: So I think we should stick to the e-list
15:30, 29 Dec 2013 - Owen James: ??
15:30, 29 Dec 2013 - Owen James: Elist?
15:30, 29 Dec 2013 - Slam: Car: teeg n dave, shag marth, pton and oliza
15:31, 29 Dec 2013 - Slam: Leaves bunn, cate, rob, V and me by train / taxi

15:32, 29 Dec 2013 - Owen James: 7 peeps.
15:32, 29 Dec 2013 - Owen James: If we get there early is there a pub?
15:32, 29 Dec 2013 - Owen James: Sounds good.
15:36, 29 Dec 2013 - Shaggy Crazy Horse: There is
15:36, 29 Dec 2013 - Shaggy Crazy Horse: And I know where
15:37, 29 Dec 2013 - Owen James: What style of shoes do you like shaggy?
15:37, 29 Dec 2013 - Shaggy Crazy Horse: Skate shoes
15:38, 29 Dec 2013 - Dave Mendez: Sounds good. I'm out of work at 1230. What time are we leaving?
15:38, 29 Dec 2013 - Shaggy Crazy Horse: I'm free all day
15:38, 29 Dec 2013 - Owen James: Do you like stilettos?
15:39, 29 Dec 2013 - Owen James: Me too
15:39, 29 Dec 2013 - Shaggy Crazy Horse: Not for myself, but yes
15:53, 29 Dec 2013 - Slam: There's a good pub across the road and a great pub 5 mins drive away
18:27, 29 Dec 2013 - Marth: Can't be arsed to read 153 new whatsapp messages. What's up folks?
18:27, 29 Dec 2013 - Marth: Big festive love to you all from Xav & me in Brussels xx
18:29, 29 Dec 2013 - Dave Mendez: There's a car crew and a train crew. These are mentioned about 10 messages ago. Can only stay until the 1st. Gonna be playing with cards. Need booze. X
18:33, 29 Dec 2013 - Bunn: And drugs would be nice
19:30, 29 Dec 2013 - Owen James: Anyone know where to get some hallucinogens? Mushrooms or summat?
20:51, 29 Dec 2013 - Bunn: Still asking around
22:11, 29 Dec 2013 - Dave Mendez: Tegs and I are thinking of training down if it's just gonna be one 7 seater car.
22:23, 29 Dec 2013 - Bongo: Just catching up on these messages, is everyone heading down tomorrow or tues?
22:59, 29 Dec 2013 - Slam: 31st, guess that's Tuesday
23:00, 29 Dec 2013 - Slam: That leaves 2 seats in the car? Also can team shagmarth be in charge of sorting that out?
23:07, 29 Dec 2013 - Bongo: I guess I'll train it down with you lot in the day then.
23:07, 29 Dec 2013 - Bongo: Those clothes are mine btw, I'll take them off your hands next time I'm round.
11:58, 30 Dec 2013 - Shaggy Crazy Horse: Why is there a train crew if we all have to be back at the same time? All in car makes more sense
11:59, 30 Dec 2013 - Cate: I would rather go by car, is there room in a car for me? X
11:59, 30 Dec 2013 - Shaggy Crazy Horse: And it's an aweful long way to go for one night anyway. Just sayin
12:00, 30 Dec 2013 - Cate: Let's go todaaay!
12:04, 30 Dec 2013 - Bunn: Just come here Cate if you're bored today
12:11, 30 Dec 2013 - Bunn: Its miserable outside today :(
12:18, 30 Dec 2013 - Vanessa "Beast" Matthews: Perfect day for hot choco and baileys
12:19, 30 Dec 2013 - Dave Mendez: At work :(
12:42, 30 Dec 2013 - Bunn: Gonna throw this (potentially) controversial suggestion out there
12:42, 30 Dec 2013 - Bunn: NYE at Croydon Road?
12:44, 30 Dec 2013 - Slam: I'm easy,  anywhere with all you beautiful people and some tunes is good for me
12:45, 30 Dec 2013 - Slam: Ideally some naughty salts as well, anyone got some thoughts on that
12:45, 30 Dec 2013 - Slam: ?
12:48, 30 Dec 2013 - Dave Mendez: I guess that it is a bit of a mission if we're off the next day. Would have been great to see the sea though.
12:49, 30 Dec 2013 - Shaggy Crazy Horse: In this weather you might as well squint your eyes and look at the ripples on the puddles in our garden
12:50, 30 Dec 2013 - Dave Mendez: Heh, perhaps I can take a trip out on your garden boat.
12:50, 30 Dec 2013 - Teegan: Point taken- it's not really the weather for a walk.  Let's visit the sea in the spring time.
12:50, 30 Dec 2013 - Slam: You'll have to fight the foxes first
12:52, 30 Dec 2013 - Slam: Thinking about food and people, phil / marth, you know some roast stuff we can have cold? Like, do a ham in the morning maybe?
12:52, 30 Dec 2013 - Slam: And can you do veggies for the veggies dave?
12:53, 30 Dec 2013 - Dave Mendez: Roast red peppers are great cold
12:53, 30 Dec 2013 - Bunn: Ok this seems to be gathering momentum. Lets see what everyone else says. What would have been spent on travel can be spent on more food
12:54, 30 Dec 2013 - Bunn: Vanessa will be reimbursed cos she's already bought a train ticket
12:55, 30 Dec 2013 - Vanessa "Beast" Matthews: I've also got a bottle of vodka and rum ready to be cracked open!
12:55, 30 Dec 2013 - Slam: I feel pretty good about this actually, bantsmas was awesome
12:56, 30 Dec 2013 - Dave Mendez: Agreed, though she should try and get a refund if possible.
13:09, 30 Dec 2013 - Vanessa "Beast" Matthews: It wasn't a lot so don't worry about it
13:10, 30 Dec 2013 - Dave Mendez: I'm happy to chip in V. Also very happy to help with food.
13:10, 30 Dec 2013 - Vanessa "Beast" Matthews: Teaches me a lesson for being too organised
13:13, 30 Dec 2013 - Cate: :/
13:15, 30 Dec 2013 - Shaggy Crazy Horse: Not sure it's one of those things in life that you need a lesson for, but yes, your fault
13:16, 30 Dec 2013 - Vanessa "Beast" Matthews: Thanks mom
13:16, 30 Dec 2013 - Dave Mendez: Is anyone not up for relocation to c town?
13:35, 30 Dec 2013 - Eliza Botts: Owen and I are fine either way.
16:06, 30 Dec 2013 - Marth: Damn, seriously? I agree, a lot cheaper, but cottage last year was sooooo epic
16:08, 30 Dec 2013 - Slam: Agreed but I'd say cos of the people, not the place
16:17, 30 Dec 2013 - Marth: 7 reasons why: (1) disco room, separated with a curtain from (2) awesome chill out room with more sofas than a room ever needs pushed into a circle, with (3) disco lights. (4) a kitchen with a table we sit and play cards around and eat around that's not covered with crap. (5) a garden to chill out in intermittently throughout the evening, where we're less likely to get stabbed, and (6) a clean, comfy bed with fresh sheets to lay your head on when the sun is rising and your body is blissfully fragile. And (7) the coast of England to enjoy with close friends and a glass of orange juice on New Year's Day. Yay?
16:23, 30 Dec 2013 - Cate: Yay!
16:25, 30 Dec 2013 - Teegan: Awww, Marth, you're such a poet! I'm easy either way x
16:29, 30 Dec 2013 - Bunn: <Media omitted>
16:29, 30 Dec 2013 - Bunn: Our table is NOT covered in crap
16:30, 30 Dec 2013 - Bunn: (I cleaned. I took offence to that one)
16:32, 30 Dec 2013 - Slam: (Bunn cleaned. He took offence to that one)
16:34, 30 Dec 2013 - Bunn: We could substitute new years day walk by the sea with something in london together?
16:55, 30 Dec 2013 - Teegan: Do you guys really not fancy it?
16:59, 30 Dec 2013 - Slam: I'm getting way more into the idea of c-town by the minute!
17:00, 30 Dec 2013 - Slam: We've got twice the people as last year, and we'll have the place all nice for you ladies
17:01, 30 Dec 2013 - Dave Mendez: Fancy a hand getting it ready tonight? Perhaps in testing the sofa out.
17:03, 30 Dec 2013 - Slam: Hehe in my experience that rarely ends in the place getting tidier!
17:04, 30 Dec 2013 - Dave Mendez: You can trust me...
17:04, 30 Dec 2013 - Slam: Sofa's free and waiting for you if you're around though
17:05, 30 Dec 2013 - Dave Mendez: Woot. There's a plan to meet Chris Alford tonight if anyone's up for that. X
17:06, 30 Dec 2013 - Bunn: Yeah i am. But whats the plan? All iv heard is flimsyness
17:09, 30 Dec 2013 - Dave Mendez: Sounds like a rerun of the last brick lane night. Any better suggestions?
17:11, 30 Dec 2013 - Slam: Partying? Blurgh! I intend to drink some fine scotch and play some games, sleep well and get cracking for tomorrow
17:15, 30 Dec 2013 - Teegan: Better suggestions please- on the facebook page If possible,  to keep Chris in the loop
17:31, 30 Dec 2013 - Bunn: Cool
17:48, 30 Dec 2013 - Dave Mendez: Sounds like the plan is to meet at the big chill in kings cross.
17:49, 30 Dec 2013 - Cate: Can I come? What's the details? X
17:50, 30 Dec 2013 - Bunn: 7 o clock kings cross
17:51, 30 Dec 2013 - Cate: Haven't eaten yet, soonest I'd get to kings cross is about 830-9. Still worth it?
17:52, 30 Dec 2013 - Teegan: Where are you Cate? I haven't eaten yet either, so we could grab something around there.

12:34, 31 Dec 2013 - Bunn: Yeah dont go OTT
12:34, 31 Dec 2013 - Shaggy Crazy Horse: No, spend what you will

14:41, 31 Dec 2013 - Owen James: I'm not coming sorry. I am not well, stupid viruses.
14:44, 31 Dec 2013 - Eliza Botts: Afraid it's not looking good, O is very poorly. I think we're going to stay home, watch a film and go to bed at 12.01 like the boring married couple we are. :( Have an awesome time though, and we will make a New Years resolution to be a little less feeble.
14:44, 31 Dec 2013 - Shaggy Crazy Horse: He's ill, you're not, come over
14:45, 31 Dec 2013 - Eliza Botts: Tempted... but I'd feel a bit mean leaving him alone and sick on New Years.

15:45, 31 Dec 2013 - Owen James: I'll sleeze on my wife as much as I damn well please.
15:46, 31 Dec 2013 - Owen James: Hey sweet knees (eliza). I better ring heaven, coz an angel just grabbed its coat.
15:47, 31 Dec 2013 - Shaggy Crazy Horse: Fever running high?

12:36, 2 Jan - Marth: Is it plugged in by the left of the tv? I saw a samsung charger camouflaged  there (it had an iPhone cable plugged into it). Reckon the samsung cable isn't far away either...
12:37, 2 Jan - Slam: No idea, there's one by my bed if you need some juice just now though x

12:51, 3 Jan - Bunn: But now its starting to turn worse
13:03, 3 Jan - Shaggy Crazy Horse: Thunder and lightning here now

13:16, 3 Jan - Bunn: Dry january off to a good start eh?
13:16, 3 Jan - Teegan: ... the storm is over
13:17, 3 Jan - Teegan: Dry January starts on the 5th. .. It's gonna be so wholesome
13:17, 3 Jan - Teegan: Or Phil and I might take up crack...
13:17, 3 Jan - ‚Ä™+44 7807 744465‚Ä¨: Are you doing dry jan too Tegan?!!
13:29, 3 Jan - Teegan: Are you surprised because of my obvious alcoholism? Yeah, Dave and I thought we'd give it a bash. The worst we can do is fail and end up in a downward spiral of alcohol dependency.  Which sounds like some fun!
13:31, 3 Jan - ‚Ä™+44 7807 744465‚Ä¨: Yay! Me and shags also trying
13:31, 3 Jan - ‚Ä™+44 7807 744465‚Ä¨: We can hang out at weekends and urm, ummmmmmm...
13:31, 3 Jan - ‚Ä™+44 7807 744465‚Ä¨: What do people do at weekends when they're not drinking/hungover?
13:32, 3 Jan - Bunn: Go for a jog??
13:55, 3 Jan - Shaggy Crazy Horse: Ugh
13:57, 3 Jan - Teegan: Let's get into exotic juices.  Or world teas.
13:57, 3 Jan - Teegan: Or we can revert to teenagedom and hang out in arcades.
13:57, 3 Jan - Shaggy Crazy Horse: I read that as "tegandom"
14:28, 3 Jan - p tschismarov: Have any of you considered devoting your weekends to the worship of Jesus Christ our lord and saviour?
14:25, 3 Jan - ‚Ä™+44 7807 744465‚Ä¨: Has anyone else seen that vice documentary about people (Americans) who claim to get high on the glory of god?

14:27, 3 Jan - Marth: Epic
14:29, 3 Jan - Bunn: Behold the glory
15:31, 3 Jan - Teegan: Phil, if you dress like that all the way through January, I think we might just make it
17:15, 3 Jan - Teegan: Anyone up for a drink after work? I want to celebrates my imminent immunity to yellow fever
17:21, 3 Jan - Slam: I'm back on the scotch and cranking, need a kind of early night tonight I think, the white fascists got kind of out of hand yesterday!

19:05, 6 Jan - Dave Mendez: Do they have a veggie burger?
19:18, 6 Jan - Slam: I think they have one made out of vegetarians, any good?
19:24, 6 Jan - Teegan: Mmmmmmm.... grilled cheese sandwich...
19:26, 6 Jan - Slam: I have done some research, they have a veggie option where you get the bun and all the veg you can fit in it, like grilled shrooms and onions, which are done on a separate veg grill
21:27, 6 Jan - Vanessa "Beast" Matthews: Oh yum the veggie option sounds really good. I might have to have it after my meat
09:53, 7 Jan - Slam: Anyone for a cine-trip tomorrow? I'd like to see the new ben stiller thing
09:53, 7 Jan - Shaggy Crazy Horse: Maybe, haven't been to a picture theatre in quite a while
09:56, 7 Jan - Marth: Meh. I've got a dinner with a friend visiting tomorrow, so will have to give it a miss this time. I really fancy seeing american hustle - next week?
10:00, 7 Jan - Vanessa "Beast" Matthews: No can do for me either this week
10:25, 7 Jan - Bunn: Apparently american hustle is really bad
10:26, 7 Jan - Shaggy Crazy Horse: Apparently Jennifer Lawrence looks boday in American hustle
10:26, 7 Jan - Marth: Damn, until now I had only heard good things.
10:26, 7 Jan - Marth: Bunn, why you gotta rain on ma parade? Grr
10:27, 7 Jan - Shaggy Crazy Horse: Again
10:27, 7 Jan - Marth: Indeed, again.
10:27, 7 Jan - Bunn: Im trying to save you! Iv only heard bad things. Not one good review
10:29, 7 Jan - Bunn: Probably wrong tho...
10:34, 7 Jan - Bunn: But mostly its cos i like to ruin things
11:03, 7 Jan - Owen James: Rotten tomatoes has American hustle at 95%. So it can't be all bad. Me and liza were thinking of seeing it.
11:05, 7 Jan - Shaggy Crazy Horse: I don't rate rotten tomatoes
11:06, 7 Jan - Owen James: Really why? It seems pretty accurate to me. And has a simple easy to understand algorithm.
11:21, 7 Jan - Eliza Botts: I'm up for seeing it Marth, despite all this rain.
11:22, 7 Jan - Eliza Botts: Unless there's actual rain... in which case I'll probably stay in...
11:23, 7 Jan - Marth: Yay! Unfortunately I can't tomorrow though, was thinking maybe pnext week orange wed?
11:24, 7 Jan - Eliza Botts: Next week is good.
11:47, 7 Jan - Shaggy Crazy Horse: Rotten tomatoes seems to consistently disagree with me, or at least it used to and now I never use it. Or any ratings site, word of mouth is best for this sort of thing, bar only to own impressions
12:51, 7 Jan - p tschismarov: Name one thing that does not consistently disagree with you.
12:49, 7 Jan - Bongo: Beer
12:51, 7 Jan - Shaggy Crazy Horse: Word
12:56, 7 Jan - ‚Ä™+44 7807 744465‚Ä¨: <Media omitted>
13:12, 7 Jan - Bunn: <Media omitted>
13:32, 7 Jan - p tschismarov: Brontosaurus mance.
14:07, 7 Jan - Owen James: Perhaps you just have terrible taste in films shaggy. Also if it consistently disagrees with you then it is an excellent system, you just need to do the opposite of what it says.
14:54, 7 Jan - Shaggy Crazy Horse: It's not excellent, it's terrible, just like bbc weather. If I have to change my mindset just so that one system works as well as others, it's a failure as a product
15:08, 7 Jan - Owen James: Can you give me examples of where it is wrong?
15:09, 7 Jan - Shaggy Crazy Horse: Like I said I haven't used it since its conception
15:09, 7 Jan - Owen James: So you have no idea if it is good or bad then?
15:09, 7 Jan - Bunn: <Media omitted>
15:10, 7 Jan - Owen James: I generally find it pretty excellent
15:10, 7 Jan - Bunn: <Media omitted>
15:10, 7 Jan - Shaggy Crazy Horse: I know it was bad
15:11, 7 Jan - Shaggy Crazy Horse: And everyone knows rotten tomatoes don't get any better
15:12, 7 Jan - Owen James: I think you may be confusing the website with the fruit.
15:56, 7 Jan - Slam: Science time! Give us 3 films you really like, and 3 you really don't.  Newer films would be better, and no cheating!
16:04, 7 Jan - Shaggy Crazy Horse: I had a browse already: rush was a great film, 89 is perhaps overrated but I'll let it slide. Snatch is 73 which I think is too low, it's certainly a million times better than rush, but perhaps it's an old film. Pitch black, that came out same time as snatch, is 57 and a failure? Well that's bullshit, it's an excellent film. I know exactly the soppy heart wrenching and gut warming films they would rate highly and it's not at all aligned to my tastes
16:15, 7 Jan - Bunn: Eurgh. Shaddap already. This is not bants
16:15, 7 Jan - Slam: That's bad testing! It means nothing if you do it blind, you're basically saying you found 3 films you kind of agree with
16:16, 7 Jan - Bunn: No1 cares about your moanig shaggy
16:16, 7 Jan - Bunn: Moaning*
16:18, 7 Jan - Owen James: Also 57% is very close to fresh. The only problem I have with rotten tomatoes is the binary nature of fresh/rotten.  If you just go by percentage instead it is more accurate.
16:18, 7 Jan - Slam: Pitch black was a solid 57, enjoyable but not particularly great
16:18, 7 Jan - Shaggy Crazy Horse: No one cares about *your* moaning bunn

16:21, 7 Jan - Bunn: The pub is for arguing
16:22, 7 Jan - Shaggy Crazy Horse: No because that would assume I have knowledge of what is and isn't, and I don't. I picked a film I watched recently, a film I know is excellent and a film I know I would enjoy
16:22, 7 Jan - Bunn: #dryjanuarysucks
16:22, 7 Jan - Dave Mendez: Agreed
16:23, 7 Jan - Bunn: Thanks dave
16:23, 7 Jan - Shaggy Crazy Horse: Based on rt I don't know if I wouldn't enjoy a film or some arsehole wouldn't enjoy a film. Moreover I don't know if a film is good so that I would enjoy it or good so it gets loads of nominations and I dot give a shit about

15:33, 8 Jan - Mike: What the hell was that ass thing all about?

09:27, 9 Jan - Vanessa "Beast" Matthews: <Media omitted>
09:32, 9 Jan - p tschismarov: Not bad. Keep at it and one day you'll be writing beautiful stories about rainbow unicorn princesses.
09:30, 9 Jan - Owen James: To be fair. The question is ambiguous and the pupil has given a correct answer given the ambiguity.
09:39, 9 Jan - Bunn: How much detention would you give them owen?
09:59, 9 Jan - Owen James: Zero. Because that answer is awesome!

16:13, 9 Jan - Slam: Both. Elevenses is for everyday
16:15, 9 Jan - Vanessa "Beast" Matthews: I was answering Hannah's question

16:19, 9 Jan - Eliza Botts: Owen's right. This is the place for dumb jokes and arguments about personal taste. Not sorting things out.

13:50, 10 Jan - Shaggy Crazy Horse: Such is the horde
13:53, 10 Jan - Mike: Just looked it up - one of the collective nouns for cats is 'pounce'

18:37, 10 Jan - Teegan: So it's only fitting
18:38, 10 Jan - Dave Mendez: I guess the legroom won't make much of an impression on you so it's only right to enjoy the drinks. X
18:39, 10 Jan - Teegan: It's a blip. Not a slide down an icy January slope. Into a pit of beer.
18:40, 10 Jan - Dave Mendez: Drool.
18:51, 10 Jan - Shaggy Crazy Horse: I thought you appreciated the plant pots, Tegan. You're just drunk!
18:51, 10 Jan - Teegan: Emphatically both
18:52, 10 Jan - Dave Mendez: Do you get better food?
18:52, 10 Jan - Teegan: (It was only a small glass of champagne)

23:33, 13 Jan - Slam: 4 should mean everyone can use whenever

14:45, 14 Jan - p tschismarov: Yo Dave you should take your boat across this thing
14:45, 14 Jan - p tschismarov: <Media omitted>
14:44, 14 Jan - Dave Mendez: Ah, the unpronounceable aqueduct in Wales! I'd love to, its a proper dream. Might have to take a few weeks off work for that. Mmmm

18:22, 14 Jan - Shaggy Crazy Horse: Google lucky chip hoxton
18:26, 14 Jan - Vanessa "Beast" Matthews: I won't make it before 7:30
18:27, 14 Jan - Shaggy Crazy Horse: Going to pop into tk maxx, need more pjs
18:32, 14 Jan - Slam: That's not a bad shout, is there one around here?
18:35, 14 Jan - ‚Ä™+44 7807 744465‚Ä¨: Guys would you rather have teeth for pubes or pubes for teeth?
18:36, 14 Jan - Teegan: Teeth for pubes.  Otherwise you'd have to develop a whale-like method of eating which would be awkward at dinner parties.
18:36, 14 Jan - Dave Mendez: Teeth for pubes
18:36, 14 Jan - Dave Mendez: For reasons stated
18:36, 14 Jan - Teegan: Good question Hannah. Touching on deep and important issues.
18:37, 14 Jan - Shaggy Crazy Horse: Bank
18:37, 14 Jan - Shaggy Crazy Horse: Or rather monument
18:38, 14 Jan - Shaggy Crazy Horse: What kind of teeth? Molars would be ok
18:39, 14 Jan - Slam: Ah yeah
18:40, 14 Jan - Teegan: Are they set in, so that pube maintenance would literally be pulling teeth? I sort of imagined then jangling about
18:40, 14 Jan - Shaggy Crazy Horse: Terrible selection, it's like they don't care about peoples home comfort
18:40, 14 Jan - Teegan: That tk maxx sucks. It's all 'business'
18:40, 14 Jan - Shaggy Crazy Horse: Would you need to brush them regularly?
18:41, 14 Jan - Teegan: Ha
18:43, 14 Jan - ‚Ä™+44 7807 744465‚Ä¨: I think teeth for pubes as only few people would know your secret
18:44, 14 Jan - ‚Ä™+44 7807 744465‚Ä¨: Unless of course you made whipping them out a great party trick
18:44, 14 Jan - Shaggy Crazy Horse: Wouldn't everyone have that?
18:44, 14 Jan - Shaggy Crazy Horse: I thought it was like an evolutionary question
18:45, 14 Jan - Bunn: Just you
18:45, 14 Jan - Bunn: Sex would be weird if everyone had it
18:45, 14 Jan - Bunn: Probably quite painful too
18:45, 14 Jan - Teegan: Nah,  it makes more sense if it's everyone
18:46, 14 Jan - Bunn: A lot of danger of getting chomped
18:46, 14 Jan - Teegan: Otherwise theres no rationale for it happening at all
18:46, 14 Jan - Shaggy Crazy Horse: Living on the edge, baby
18:46, 14 Jan - Bunn: Its a 'would YOU rather' question though
18:47, 14 Jan - Teegan: You'd probably develop some kind of defense
18:47, 14 Jan - Shaggy Crazy Horse: That's very egocentric
18:47, 14 Jan - Teegan: Like an armadillo
18:47, 14 Jan - Teegan: Is also negative banter
18:47, 14 Jan - Bunn: I guess if everyone got asked the question and made a choice
18:47, 14 Jan - Bunn: Then if they disnt have a mouth full of pubes
18:48, 14 Jan - Bunn: It would be safe to assume they went for the teeth for pubes option
18:48, 14 Jan - Bunn: And you could have weird teeth crunching sex
18:49, 14 Jan - Teegan: Beautiful
18:49, 14 Jan - Shaggy Crazy Horse: Not from behind
18:49, 14 Jan - Bunn: That might be the only option in this weird fantasy world
18:50, 14 Jan - Shaggy Crazy Horse: Would you have pubic milk teeth?
18:51, 14 Jan - Bunn: Gross. Just picturing someone with pubes for teeth is making me ill
18:51, 14 Jan - Teegan: Agreed
18:51, 14 Jan - Shaggy Crazy Horse: I meant the other way around
18:52, 14 Jan - Teegan: Always having hair in your mouth might be one of the worst feeling things
18:52, 14 Jan - Shaggy Crazy Horse: You probably get used to it. You could style it all you want with saliva
18:52, 14 Jan - Teegan: Blerk
19:01, 14 Jan - Mike: 53 new messages
19:01, 14 Jan - Mike: Wtf guys

19:03, 14 Jan - ‚Ä™+44 7807 744465‚Ä¨: You've really helped me here
19:09, 14 Jan - Slam: I've spent too long thinking about this
19:10, 14 Jan - Slam: But I'm down for pubes for teeth
19:10, 14 Jan - Slam: You could trim them right down, and I think having a Johnson ringed with teeth is like saying goodbye to sex
19:12, 14 Jan - Mike: I refuse to read the rest of this conversation
19:13, 14 Jan - Mike: Wouldn't teeth for pubes look like awesome ivory underwear
19:13, 14 Jan - Mike: Id go that
19:24, 14 Jan - Teegan: That's how I was picturing it, Mike
19:24, 14 Jan - Teegan: Kinda tribal

23:30, 20 Jan - Mike: Will there still be a burger group?
23:42, 20 Jan - Slam: I'll revel in the human exploitation with you Mike
23:42, 20 Jan - Slam: It's either that or salsa dancing. I'll take human suffering every time
23:50, 20 Jan - p tschismarov: Wows has the fat guy from the mclovin film. T'should be good.
12:11, 21 Jan - Teegan: Looking for a likely burger on the wharf. .. byron gets all the reviews
12:11, 21 Jan - Teegan: But is Super expensive
12:12, 21 Jan - Shaggy Crazy Horse: Same price as all others
12:13, 21 Jan - Teegan: Also dave had some ulterior motive for not going
12:13, 21 Jan - Teegan: Other option is GBK, which is not at all original
12:13, 21 Jan - Teegan: But is full of food
12:14, 21 Jan - Shaggy Crazy Horse: Gbk is quite good, lots I burger options
12:18, 21 Jan - Teegan: Plenty of time for votes and debate throughout the afternoon
12:59, 21 Jan - Owen James: Me and eliza are seeing wolf tonight.
13:00, 21 Jan - Dave Mendez: We're joining you. Looking to see if we can burger on the wharf beforehand
13:03, 21 Jan - Owen James: Me and eliza are eating at home. We shall come for drinks after you burgharrrgh though
13:07, 21 Jan - Dave Mendez: Aight. Any votes on burger venue tonight?
13:26, 21 Jan - Slam: I recommend Byron, it's slightly more expensive but a thousand times more deliciou
13:26, 21 Jan - Slam: What time's the film?
13:31, 21 Jan - Eliza Botts: 7.30 or 8.15 - would prefer the earlier time as the film is almost 3 hours long...
13:40, 21 Jan - Marth: Yikes. Yes please, earlier rather than later for me too. Is there another venue where we can see it even earlier? Xx
14:38, 21 Jan - Teegan: Earlier showing is best- can people make 6.30 for dinner? Advantage of the wharf is the cheap tuesday which I am keen to take advantage of
14:42, 21 Jan - Slam: O2 is cineworld as well, if that helps
14:43, 21 Jan - Owen James: üêäRarrrgh!!! Stomp!!! Smash!!!üêä
14:45, 21 Jan - Eliza Botts: There is a showing at 6.40 at canary wharf, but not sure that leaves time for eating? I need to eat something before 3 hour film...
14:46, 21 Jan - Owen James: ÓÄùwhoooshÓÄù
14:53, 21 Jan - Eliza Botts: Shun Owen
14:54, 21 Jan - Eliza Botts: Oop, that was supposed to be 'shhh Owen'. But that will do just as well.
15:38, 21 Jan - Owen James: üê©woof woofüê©
15:50, 21 Jan - Teegan: I agree. With Lize. Hard to agree with Owen here. That is to say, not eating before a 3 hour movie will make me cross. Meet at 6? I'm going to vote GBK because the veggie selection at byron looks half arsed, but I could be persuaded by the pain of others for Scottish meat.  If it were a thing.
15:52, 21 Jan - Mike: I partly agree with Owen. I think his crocodile was way off though
16:03, 21 Jan - Dave Mendez: I agree with everybody! Merry Christmas! Xx
16:38, 21 Jan - Teegan: Useful stuff, guys.
16:39, 21 Jan - Dave Mendez: Gbk please. Byron looks weak for the veg veg

22:24, 21 Jan - Bunn: How was the film guys?
23:28, 21 Jan - Mike: Did it finish yet?
00:23, 22 Jan - Dave Mendez: It finished. It was pretty good, didn't feel like three hours. There are some great scenes and it's very entertaining but a bit shallow. Perhaps that's the point.
00:39, 22 Jan - Teegan: I really liked it. I laughed heartily as di Caprio got fucked up and commited fraud. Thumbs up.

08:33, 23 Jan - Mike: That film was amazing, but so damn tough
08:55, 23 Jan - Slam: I thought it was pretty optimistic actually
08:57, 23 Jan - Slam: It's basically the sorry of a man getting away from all his rich superficial friends, and starting a life of outdoor living, where he gets to travel and lot and meet a wide variety of people
08:58, 23 Jan - Owen James: You should be one of those voltswagen "see film differently" people sam.
09:00, 23 Jan - Mike: Haha. It also makes it easier if you watch it as the prequel to Django Unchained
10:03, 23 Jan - p tschismarov: The trailer made it look like a goofy, happy film.

17:44, 23 Jan - Teegan: Any fun planned this evening?
18:03, 23 Jan - Slam: Woooo climbing! actually I'm probably not making it, l looks like frustrating work, kebab and early night tonight
18:06, 23 Jan - Teegan: How would it be if I finished my frustrating work, came over and cooked something even better than a kebab, and then stared at your tv?
18:07, 23 Jan - Teegan: Obviously the plan would still work if you really wanted a kebab
18:16, 23 Jan - Shaggy Crazy Horse: Sounds great tegs, come on round
18:23, 23 Jan - Slam: I might get a kebab, and put it in whatever you cook

15:03, 25 Jan - Bongo: Well I'm coming round to pick up my squash racket before it starts so I'll throw  in some chicken and motivation juice (beer).
15:03, 25 Jan - Shaggy Crazy Horse: Have you caved in as well?

22:06, 27 Jan - Eliza Botts: Have you watched the first episode of Archer where Archer is a velociraptor? It's pretty funny.
22:17, 27 Jan - Mike: I watched that episode randomly with no context. Was so confused
22:22, 27 Jan - Owen James: It makes the show even better.
00:47, 28 Jan - Slam: Didn't get to see them, I thought it was a good idea to get tickets on the door. It wasn't!
12:58, 28 Jan - Slam: Happy burger day everyone! Honest burger tonight, it's on Dean street just by Soho square
12:58, 28 Jan - Slam: I'll try and get there for 7 to get a table, it gets busy but there's a bunch of other places nearby if it's too bad

17:57, 28 Jan - Shaggy Crazy Horse: Need the president to go as well, although a whole cabinet is already good
18:02, 28 Jan - Teegan: It's a start I guess.  The beeb say no barricades will move until the president steps down. Excellent protesting.
18:03, 28 Jan - Shaggy Crazy Horse: No half measures. They should get relentless so sponsor the people

16:01, 29 Jan - Teegan: Either good for me. If we go to the late one we can eat first
16:01, 29 Jan - Teegan: Mmmm... eat
16:01, 29 Jan - Teegan: Do we have a fourth person?
17:15, 29 Jan - Mike: Food in C wharf? Will be around for about 7.30

15:04, 30 Jan - Shaggy Crazy Horse: Where I came from might not be a country soon. Again
15:45, 30 Jan - Owen James: Do you have dual citizenship or are you just British? If the former what would happen?
16:05, 30 Jan - Shaggy Crazy Horse: Just British
16:06, 30 Jan - Shaggy Crazy Horse: If the former it would have depended on the new country dual citizenship laws as well as process of re-establishing citizenship in a newly formed country given the citizenship in the old one
16:24, 30 Jan - Teegan: Lots of people, especially rural,  become citizens of nowhere that way.  Sad.
17:02, 30 Jan - Bunn: Sounds pretty awesome being a citizen of nowhere
17:03, 30 Jan - Bunn: Destined to wander the earths surface looking for justice
17:03, 30 Jan - Bunn: And....
17:03, 30 Jan - Bunn: Revenge
17:31, 30 Jan - Teegan: Yeeeaahh
17:37, 30 Jan - Bunn: *epic 80s guitar solo*
18:54, 30 Jan - Teegan: Except you'd mainly be playing epic guitar solos in border control cells
18:55, 30 Jan - Teegan: They'd still be epic, obviously
09:27, 31 Jan - Shaggy Crazy Horse: Uff tea - does everyone have threads to wear for this?

19:15, 31 Jan - Bongo: Centre of Greenwich, we're going to do crazy stuff, if you catch my drift.
19:19, 31 Jan - Bongo: You're bent over at work until 2am?!
19:20, 31 Jan - Bongo: Surely not
19:22, 31 Jan - Slam: Ok, maybe 8, it's still an infringement of my liberty though
19:22, 31 Jan - Slam: I'm being oppressed!
19:23, 31 Jan - Bunn: People from canning town complaining that grenwich is far.
19:25, 31 Jan - Mike: I'm still trying to figure out what the crazy stuff is
19:28, 31 Jan - Shaggy Crazy Horse: Buttsex
19:32, 31 Jan - p tschismarov: Mad bingo yo
19:36, 31 Jan - Bongo: Mad bingo with hookers and nose candy

14:18, 1 Feb - Marth: Picking up my new bike
14:20, 1 Feb - Marth: ÓÑ∂

14:29, 1 Feb - Bongo: That sounds fun, I'm tempted to buy one just to do that.
14:31, 1 Feb - Slam: Sounds like a sweet ride, you got a basket and done rainbow tassles for that bad boy?

19:41, 3 Feb - ‚Ä™+44 7807 744465‚Ä¨: I have 2 beautiful French girls stayin with me (my Parisienne housemates from when I lived there)
19:42, 3 Feb - ‚Ä™+44 7807 744465‚Ä¨: Is it cool if I bring them?
19:42, 3 Feb - Mike: Um duh

20:05, 3 Feb - Shaggy Crazy Horse: Both days
20:33, 3 Feb - Owen James: Do the burgers match this one. Everything is made from scratch... except the colslaw.
20:33, 3 Feb - Owen James: <Media omitted>
21:32, 3 Feb - Teegan: I can't believe you couldn't be bothered to make your own coleslaw!

18:20, 4 Feb - Slam: Meal and a show for me! What's the deal with the American Bunn?
18:26, 4 Feb - Bunn: I think he'll be round tonight
18:28, 4 Feb - Vanessa "Beast" Matthews: I just ordered my burger
18:29, 4 Feb - Slam: Send us a sepia picture when it gets there please, I HAVE TO KNOW what it looks like!
18:30, 4 Feb - Vanessa "Beast" Matthews: <Media omitted>
18:30, 4 Feb - Vanessa "Beast" Matthews: It's really dark in here
18:31, 4 Feb - Dave Mendez: Is it cool for Tegs and I to stay over tonight as the tube is gonna make travel to Uxbridge crazy.
18:32, 4 Feb - Slam: Yarrr! You'll have to wrestle an American for the best bed though. Loser gets Phil's room
18:32, 4 Feb - Slam: That burger looks like a Ron Swanson special
18:37, 4 Feb - Vanessa "Beast" Matthews: It's a pretty good burger
18:38, 4 Feb - Slam: Out of ten?
18:39, 4 Feb - Shaggy Crazy Horse: That burger looks super tiny
18:39, 4 Feb - Vanessa "Beast" Matthews: 7.5
18:39, 4 Feb - Vanessa "Beast" Matthews: It has a lot of meat
18:41, 4 Feb - Slam: That's an ok burger, right there. Is it as small as it looks, or are they American style ten gallon coffee cups?
18:41, 4 Feb - Vanessa "Beast" Matthews: Nah it's decent size
18:41, 4 Feb - Vanessa "Beast" Matthews: The plate is huge
20:16, 4 Feb - Mike: What's the craic D&T?
08:52, 5 Feb - Teegan: Hey guys, can someone help me out with the wifi settings in c town- I have the IP address but not the rest. Don't make me go to the office!
09:07, 5 Feb - Mike: <Media omitted>
09:09, 5 Feb - Teegan: Hero! Thanks x
11:11, 5 Feb - Bunn: Is this to stop the wifi being so terrible?
11:12, 5 Feb - Bunn: I need this
11:16, 5 Feb - Shaggy Crazy Horse: I'm bringing a router from work to deal with this
14:34, 5 Feb - Teegan: You guys have a little mouse. He is very sweet, but should probably live somewhere else.
14:35, 5 Feb - Teegan: Or as Owen would say, ÓÅì.
15:49, 5 Feb - Shaggy Crazy Horse: Her name M-M-M-Monster.
16:11, 5 Feb - Bongo: Maybe she'll have epic battles with the rat. We should arm her and throw a training montage.
16:13, 5 Feb - Bongo: And film the results
16:13, 5 Feb - Bongo: Make lots of money
16:13, 5 Feb - Bongo: And move to brazil
16:18, 5 Feb - Bunn: Home made humane mouse trap anyone?
16:18, 5 Feb - Bunn: Little engineering project
16:27, 5 Feb - Shaggy Crazy Horse: We have a glue trap. I suggested we also put spikes and poison on it.
16:37, 5 Feb - Dave Mendez: Let's buy Mousetrap and use that
17:31, 5 Feb - Teegan: I vote for Bongo's idea. Then Bunn and Dave's
17:36, 5 Feb - Marth: Not shag's "pimp my trap"? We could have had a contest. I'm thinking a mini replica of the canning town drive-through macDs...
17:36, 5 Feb - Marth: Or get a cat!!!!
17:37, 5 Feb - Marth: (So excited I thought of that)
17:37, 5 Feb - Shaggy Crazy Horse: Would you rather: use a glue trap and butcher said mouse with a cleaver or capture her with a humane mouse trap and throw outside to die in the freezing cold hinted by canning town ghetto predators?
17:38, 5 Feb - Shaggy Crazy Horse: I'm allergic to cats, so fuck you
17:39, 5 Feb - Bunn: Yeah we cant get a cat cos of Shaggy's dumb allergies
17:41, 5 Feb - Teegan: Maybe we should keep it,  and put a waistcoat on it,  and pet it and pet it and pet it?
17:43, 5 Feb - Marth: Replace shaggy with a cat?
17:43, 5 Feb - Marth: ... joke?
17:43, 5 Feb - Shaggy Crazy Horse: Hmmm....I could use a better place to live...
17:45, 5 Feb - Slam: How about a pet that eats mice, but doesn't trigger allergies?
17:46, 5 Feb - Slam: There's that python going in Bristol, that would be cool
17:46, 5 Feb - Bongo: Didn't we use the glue trap the. Throw it in the snow last time?
17:46, 5 Feb - Shaggy Crazy Horse: Perfect! I propose we name it Cate
17:46, 5 Feb - Bongo: I don't think it gets much more inhumane than that
17:47, 5 Feb - Shaggy Crazy Horse: Not true. Freezing is one if the better ways to die
17:48, 5 Feb - Slam: We all eat animals, I don't think we can consistently cry over the slightly uncomfortable death of vermin
20:23, 5 Feb - Wills joined
17:49, 5 Feb - Slam: Also, Pete got one with a hammer once, I've always been a bit jealous of that
18:05, 5 Feb - Teegan: That was a terrible sorry.  If mice had a bible, that mouse would almost certainly be jesus.
18:06, 5 Feb - Shaggy Crazy Horse: And they would learn not to live in out houses and eat our food. We all live dairy tales. Except the bible. It's terrible
18:11, 5 Feb - Teegan: Dave doesn't live dairy tales.
18:11, 5 Feb - Shaggy Crazy Horse: Haha so much misspelling
18:16, 5 Feb - Bunn: Wagwan tonight?
18:18, 5 Feb - Slam: Drink ? Salsa if I can be bothered. It's not looking good. We could do speakers maybe?
18:21, 5 Feb - Bunn: That'd be nice to get done. I'll txt xav
18:21, 5 Feb - Bunn: Wait. Tube strike. We'll do it next week
18:22, 5 Feb - Slam: Hah, for sure!
18:54, 5 Feb - Teegan: Does this mean there is no plan?
19:22, 5 Feb - Shaggy Crazy Horse: I wouldn't rely on those guys to have a plan
20:11, 5 Feb - Slam: We've got a lot of plans, that's the easy part!

19:08, 8 Feb - Shaggy Crazy Horse: Aptly named, a great drink for dry ginuary
19:15, 8 Feb - Shaggy Crazy Horse: Don't think I'm going to make it out of the house today, only just stopped the hangover. Plus it's raining, so cycling's out of the question

19:25, 8 Feb - Shaggy Crazy Horse: Mmmmmmmmmm Dallas chicken
17:13, 9 Feb - Vanessa "Beast" Matthews: It's -22 but feels like -33. It's so cold that there are ice crystals in the air that it looks like permanent glitter
18:03, 9 Feb - Teegan: I can't even begin to fathom what that means! But it sounds beautiful.
18:05, 9 Feb - Shaggy Crazy Horse: Sounds like acid
20:50, 9 Feb - p tschismarov: <Media omitted>
20:52, 9 Feb - p tschismarov: <Media omitted>
20:53, 9 Feb - p tschismarov: Testing

20:51, 9 Feb - Shaggy Crazy Horse: Wow Vienna looks great this time of year
21:01, 9 Feb - Slam: Jesus see a doctor dude, that stuff looks like an explosion in a mountain dew factory
21:15, 9 Feb - p tschismarov: I had to use my superlative paint skills for this. Not for lack of trying with more natural means though. I heroically drank huge amounts of wine and beer. All for the arts and for your birthday you ungrateful swine.
21:15, 9 Feb - Slam: I greatly appreciate every millilitre of effort you've put in brother, i'll quaff my next tea in your honour!
21:16, 9 Feb - Bunn: Phil i think you wouldv appreciated our heroic drinking games last night
21:34, 9 Feb - p tschismarov: From what i'm reading i'm surprised anybody is still alive.
23:53, 9 Feb - Owen James: What does "hb8" mean phil?
23:54, 9 Feb - Mike: That's clearly a delta
06:12, 10 Feb - p tschismarov: You try writing in natural paint in snow that's up past your knees with shrunken equipment and then editing the results using sophisticated photo manipulation software (sometimes pixel by pixel).
13:13, 10 Feb - Slam: Now that I'm over the student style hangover that was yesterday, mainly spent curled around the toilet wishing for the sweet release of death, thanks to all of you for making Friday an almost perfect night! My only regret is that I never got down to see the stabby rap room, I blame whoever said they were playing Destinies Child at about 11!
13:13, 10 Feb - Mike: Seen it
13:14, 10 Feb - Slam: Also special thanks to Bongo for saving everyone a massive headache and putting the meal on his card, that must've been huge so please make sure people pay him back!
20:11, 10 Feb - Bongo: Damn I just replied on the other channel - most people paid and some people over paid so whatevs everyone who's left can just buy me a pint
20:12, 10 Feb - Bongo: That was hella fun seeing everyone as well, we should do mass meals more often
20:18, 10 Feb - ‚Ä™+44 7807 744465‚Ä¨: My friend just discovered a new Nordic themed bar which is apparently great fun, we should all goooo
20:34, 10 Feb - Slam: Done! When?
20:55, 10 Feb - Bongo: Nordic = shouting loads and pounding on tables yes?
20:55, 10 Feb - Bongo: Then I'm in as well.
22:37, 10 Feb - Owen James: I don't want to alarm you all but I have the makings ofa game better than the demon game.
22:38, 10 Feb - Slam: Give us titillating hints!
15:06, 11 Feb - Teegan: Very excited about this,  owen
15:07, 11 Feb - Teegan: Guys, I heard some terrible hippies left clothes,  hats and ukeleles all over your house- can we come over to tidy up after them please?
15:07, 11 Feb - Slam: It's ok, we burnt it all, back to the normal c-town squalor now
15:09, 11 Feb - Slam: You'd be very welcome to come dance in the ashes though, Mike's probably the best bet for tonight x
15:17, 11 Feb - Eliza Botts: Some titillating hints...spies... moles... scavenger hunt... Ooooh!
17:23, 11 Feb - Teegan: I like the ooooh bit best
17:24, 11 Feb - Teegan: How's about it Mike? What plans?
17:27, 11 Feb - Mike: Heading home soon, will be back about 7ish?
17:31, 11 Feb - Teegan: Fun. I fancy a film and a beer. Compliance?
17:55, 11 Feb - Mike: I'll allow it
17:56, 11 Feb - Mike: We have HIV cowboy film
17:58, 11 Feb - Slam: I love your film choices. There's one just come out about a going French girl who falls through different levels of degradation and sexual experimentation
17:58, 11 Feb - Slam: It sounds like the blackest of black comedies, it made me think of you
18:01, 11 Feb - Slam: Ooh also there's a new cirque de soleil thing I want to go to if anyone's up for it
18:02, 11 Feb - Slam: And Robocop!
18:05, 11 Feb - Shaggy Crazy Horse: I don't think quidam is new, although their names all sound weirdly samey
20:54, 11 Feb - Bongo: Sam that film you described just sounds like porn.
21:02, 11 Feb - Mike: Nymphomaniac?
21:03, 11 Feb - Mike: Hear you see shia le buif shagging for real
21:03, 11 Feb - Mike: Shabby la bleef whatever his name is
21:23, 11 Feb - Slam: Yeah that one! Yeah kind of porny! Apparently you actually see almost nothing though
21:24, 11 Feb - Slam: Did not not shim sham la beef was in it though, pretty sure I don't want to see his junk
22:39, 11 Feb - Owen James: A warning: that film is by lars von trier, his previous films have included a woman cutting off her own genitalia. He is FUCKED UP. So I doubt it will be what you are expecting.

13:45, 13 Feb - ‚Ä™+44 7545 989149‚Ä¨ joined
15:17, 13 Feb - Owen James: The game is coming together.  I have written all the rules. Which weekends are people free?
15:19, 13 Feb - Owen James: Btw dan. I have made a new game, a bit like the demon game but shorter and with more spies and moles and tailing and scavenger hunting. It is called cold war conundrum!
15:19, 13 Feb - ‚Ä™+44 7545 989149‚Ä¨: Eeeeexcellent...
15:20, 13 Feb - Owen James: Can I email you the rules and get your input before sharing with everyone. You were a great help with the demon game.
15:21, 13 Feb - Owen James: Are you danruddick@hotmail.com?
15:32, 13 Feb - Owen James: Hey in fact Bunn would you like to do this for your birthday? Part of the game is that it ends up in a pub anyway! A pub in which we could have pub lunch...
15:54, 13 Feb - Shaggy Crazy Horse: I don't see this happening on Sunday
15:55, 13 Feb - Owen James: Saturday?
15:55, 13 Feb - Owen James: Whats happening tonight by the way?
16:02, 13 Feb - Shaggy Crazy Horse: Depends. I'd like to slack around and see the Lego movie Saturday, also depends on the weather surely?

16:09, 13 Feb - Eliza Botts: Yeah, you definitely don't want to play the spy game in wet or windy weather.
16:26, 13 Feb - Owen James: The spy game is so good by the way!
16:26, 13 Feb - Owen James: I haven't played it yet.  But I think it is better than the demon game.
16:27, 13 Feb - Shaggy Crazy Horse: Gaming banter in gaming group please
16:27, 13 Feb - Owen James: This isn't gaming banter. This is for everyone.
16:28, 13 Feb - Shaggy Crazy Horse: Spy GAME
16:28, 13 Feb - Owen James: Except Sarah. She did not like the demon game.
16:29, 13 Feb - Owen James: Yeah but shaggy this is not a video game. This is a game that hopefully everyone will play.
16:30, 13 Feb - Owen James: Also "cold war conundrum" does not contain the word "spy"
16:30, 13 Feb - Owen James: Or the word "game"
16:30, 13 Feb - Shaggy Crazy Horse: You called it the spy game
16:31, 13 Feb - Owen James: Ok what topics are allowed in this group then baas?

18:48, 12 Mar - Bongo: @tegs game on for lunch, I'll ping you in the morning
18:49, 12 Mar - Bongo: They may say it's going to be sunny
18:49, 12 Mar - Vanessa "Beast" Matthews: Is that meant to be a nuance?
18:49, 12 Mar - Bongo: But I bet my monkey's uncle it's going to be cold and depressing
18:50, 12 Mar - Vanessa "Beast" Matthews: You don't have a monkey so you can't bet that
18:50, 12 Mar - Teegan: Dibs on bongo's monkey uncle
18:50, 12 Mar - Teegan: Sorry
18:50, 12 Mar - Bongo: They may say I don't have a monkey
18:50, 12 Mar - Teegan: Monkey's uncle
18:51, 12 Mar - Vanessa "Beast" Matthews: Nah still can't make a bet on that
18:51, 12 Mar - Bongo: Who's going to stop me?
18:51, 12 Mar - Vanessa "Beast" Matthews: Me
18:51, 12 Mar - Vanessa "Beast" Matthews: Phil don't listen to bongo's weather pessimism.  It's going to be glorious

18:53, 12 Mar - Teegan: Slam, how was the j'interview?
18:54, 12 Mar - Mike: bongo : mixing idioms like water off a camels back
18:55, 12 Mar - Teegan: It'll take more than two stones to get that camel through the eye of the beerholder
18:55, 12 Mar - Teegan: As bongo would say
18:56, 12 Mar - Bongo: Well said young grass hopper
18:57, 12 Mar - Teegan: Beer somewhere anyone?
18:58, 12 Mar - Bongo: Where are ye?
18:59, 12 Mar - Bongo: I could go for a quick one
18:59, 12 Mar - Teegan: At work still
18:59, 12 Mar - Teegan: I'm just giving a few minutes to Wills
19:00, 12 Mar - Bongo: I'm just leaving, could meet at that place on the corner
19:00, 12 Mar - Bongo: Prince something?
19:00, 12 Mar - Slam: I'm going to get drunk somewhere. Probably at that salsa bar, so I can swear at elegant people. Y'all welcome to join, but I won't tolerate joviality, frivolity or any other kind of monkey business
19:01, 12 Mar - Mike: That badly huh?
19:03, 12 Mar - Teegan: 10 mins?
19:04, 12 Mar - Bongo: Aight
19:04, 12 Mar - Bongo: I'm pretty much there now
19:04, 12 Mar - Bongo: Or are you talking to Sam?
19:05, 12 Mar - Slam: Actually really well, which had made me maudlin. Seems like I'm better at everything when I'm too hungover to stand up  by myself
19:06, 12 Mar - Bongo: Your vocab's gone out the hatch too
19:11, 12 Mar - Slam: I'll batten down my bellyaching
19:12, 12 Mar - Slam: You guys drinking around Blackfriars somewhere? Might pop over in a bit
19:13, 12 Mar - Teegan: Yeah m
19:13, 12 Mar - Teegan: In the albino
19:14, 12 Mar - Teegan: Albion
19:15, 12 Mar - Bongo: Yea I'm in there now
19:16, 12 Mar - Bongo: Hungover interviews are a tricky one
19:18, 12 Mar - Bongo: I never know whether it went really well because I was still drunk
19:18, 12 Mar - Bongo: But in retrospect they all went really well so I reckon we're onto something
20:38, 12 Mar - Dave Mendez: Anyone at c town? X
20:39, 12 Mar - Shaggy Crazy Horse: Not for a few hours
20:44, 12 Mar - Dave Mendez: Good lord

19:23, 13 Mar - Slam: The Phil requests some wine for the cooking, and also for his face
19:24, 13 Mar - Slam: I guess I've been designated his whatsapp interpreter
19:34, 13 Mar - Teegan: On my way back,  wineladen

09:05, 14 Mar - Mike: @bongo: the only thing keeping me awake is the pain
09:06, 14 Mar - ‚Ä™+61 405 567 873‚Ä¨: Bongo is awake ?
09:06, 14 Mar - ‚Ä™+61 405 567 873‚Ä¨: Bongo sleeps while he's standing up .....
09:07, 14 Mar - ‚Ä™+61 405 567 873‚Ä¨: Im still here , having computer illiterate troubles leaving thiis convo :p
09:23, 14 Mar - Shaggy Crazy Horse: Why are you trying to leave, you prawn?

09:26, 14 Mar - Shaggy Crazy Horse: Haha I feel fine now, I guess I'm made of sterner stuff
09:28, 14 Mar - Teegan: If you hit the settings buttom on your phone, you can leave groups through the 'group info' tab

13:06, 14 Mar - Owen James: What were all of you doing last night? And why would you get that smashed on a weekday night. Hangovers on Sunday are fine. A work day hangover is terrible. I did not enjoy Monday.
13:25, 14 Mar - Shaggy Crazy Horse: That's because you're a wuss
13:27, 14 Mar - Dave Mendez: Phil returned with schnaps and then went on a beer run. Of would have been rude not to drink!

17:38, 14 Mar - Dave Mendez: Why do a thing like that?
17:41, 14 Mar - Mike: Cause no point going ctown and back out again
17:42, 14 Mar - Mike: Rather get my reddit on for a bit
17:46, 14 Mar - Teegan: I'm in a bar in haggerston of you care to join
17:46, 14 Mar - Teegan: Canal side, nice aspect
17:49, 14 Mar - Mike: Ite, gona be bout an hour tho
17:53, 14 Mar - Teegan: I'm working for now, so I'm here for the long haul- no point in leaving as it's so close to islington
18:35, 14 Mar - Slam: I'm having a quick one in all bar one, Moorgate if anyone's passing by, we all up there for 8 otherwise?
18:43, 14 Mar - Teegan: location: https://maps.google.com/?q=51.5367737,-0.0784776
18:43, 14 Mar - Teegan: Wills and I are here
18:45, 14 Mar - Mike: I'm heading moorgate cause there's a direct train
19:04, 14 Mar - Owen James: We might be late. we missed our train and there are delays on northern line.
19:16, 14 Mar - Vanessa "Beast" Matthews: Does anyone have an iPhone 5 cable I could borrow over the weekend?
19:17, 14 Mar - Vanessa "Beast" Matthews: It's the same one used for the iPad mini
19:27, 14 Mar - Shaggy Crazy Horse: Don't have either of those things
19:41, 14 Mar - Mike: I made an awesome graph today
19:41, 14 Mar - Mike: The house numbers of properties sold in the last year. Spot the odd one out...
19:41, 14 Mar - Mike: <Media omitted>
19:47, 14 Mar - Owen James: 1!
19:47, 14 Mar - Owen James: And 13.
19:47, 14 Mar - Owen James: But I'm more interested in 1.
19:48, 14 Mar - Owen James: My initial thoughts were that if you had the only house on a street you wouldn't number it, you would name it.
19:49, 14 Mar - Owen James: Then I realised that surely for every house number 2 there would be a number 1 so they should at least be equal.
19:51, 14 Mar - Owen James: I come to the conclusion that if you own house 1 you are less likely to sell. I have yet to figure out why.
21:23, 14 Mar - Bongo: Reminds me of benford's law, that one's pretty messed up
21:24, 14 Mar - Owen James: Benfords law?
22:13, 14 Mar - Slam: You mean more likely to sell
22:15, 14 Mar - Owen James: 22:15
22:26, 14 Mar - Mike: Benfords law is where loads more statistics start with a 1 because they're exponentially distributed, eg longest rivers, CEO salaries etc
00:30, 15 Mar - Shaggy Crazy Horse: <Media omitted>
00:32, 15 Mar - Owen James: Oh. Yeah I knew about that, didn't know it was called benfords law. That why I was surprised by the fact that there were fewer 1s than 2s.
00:32, 15 Mar - Owen James: Night  night now.  Owen sleeps.
00:52, 15 Mar - Shaggy Crazy Horse: It's called "drink me". Unlike other cocktails they don't mix it, but just take out of the fridge, and give you a shot of apple juice in case it's too strong. It's not very tasty despite all the effort
11:20, 15 Mar - Bongo: Who's up for a partaay, I need something to keep my attention or I'm going to fall asleep
11:47, 15 Mar - Shaggy Crazy Horse: Going to see Lego movie now. Pub later?
11:58, 15 Mar - Bongo: Game on

12:38, 15 Mar - Bongo: Lol sounds good
12:39, 15 Mar - Owen James: Lol? Shaggy just stated a fact why did you lol?
12:43, 15 Mar - Bongo: The fact made me laugh
12:45, 15 Mar - Shaggy Crazy Horse: I didn't realise the grand Budapest hotel was the new wes Anderson film, I really want to see it!
12:48, 15 Mar - Owen James: It was good.
13:19, 15 Mar - Bongo: Just witnessed a pidgeon swallow a cigarette butt
13:19, 15 Mar - Bongo: Nearly vommed
13:21, 15 Mar - Bongo: Ctown never fails to surprise
14:32, 15 Mar - Shaggy Crazy Horse: You or the pidgeon?
15:09, 15 Mar - Bongo: Me
15:10, 15 Mar - Bongo: Pidge probably had the best meal in a week
15:42, 15 Mar - Marth: Hola hombres!! Brunch funday tomorrow at mine starting at midday? Blueberry pancakes etc. followed by board games and/or frisbee in the local park. Bring fruit, bacon, sausages, and perhaps the odd extra maple syrup &/ whatever else you might fancy. Mmm? Xxx

16:04, 15 Mar - Bongo: No brunch tomorrow
16:04, 15 Mar - Bongo: Elbow ski is 9 or something isn't it?
16:05, 15 Mar - Shaggy Crazy Horse: Brunch starts midday
16:06, 15 Mar - Bongo: Midday is subjective
16:07, 15 Mar - Bongo: I was hoping she'd give a time so that we could be 2 hours late
16:20, 15 Mar - Marth: Indeed, 12 midday. Rock up whenever, the only risk is that we'll have eaten all the pancakes innit. Yay phase 10!
18:30, 15 Mar - Vanessa "Beast" Matthews: I'm in for the movie. I'm just charging my phone at the apple shop. Where is everyone?
18:30, 15 Mar - Vanessa "Beast" Matthews: @martha not sure I can make it tomorrow. My brother is in town and wants to hang out

20:30, 15 Mar - Owen James: I think xav already has it. However we could make 8 player catan with a second expansion.
20:32, 15 Mar - Bunn: Nerds
20:33, 15 Mar - Bunn: ;)
20:51, 15 Mar - Mike: I'm a nerd and I don't even know what this is anymore

10:53, 18 Mar - Teegan: Work problem
10:54, 18 Mar - Teegan: Trying to import csv data into postgres- tried changing postgres encoding- do I need to do something to the csv file?
10:55, 18 Mar - Teegan: Answers on a postcard please
10:56, 18 Mar - Shaggy Crazy Horse: What encoding does csv have? Looks like it's in some sort of byte code, or whatever you're importing it into converts it to some weird byte code
10:56, 18 Mar - Teegan: How would I go about finding out about the byte code?
10:57, 18 Mar - Shaggy Crazy Horse: Can you open and read csv in notepad?
11:01, 18 Mar - Teegan: This is where my basic lack of computing ability comes into the fore! I will try
11:02, 18 Mar - Teegan: Yes I can!
11:04, 18 Mar - Owen James: It stands for comma seperated values. Its a really simple ascii encoding.  Each comma means a new cell and two commas means a new row.
11:05, 18 Mar - Shaggy Crazy Horse: So then Postgres is trying to read more into than required
11:06, 18 Mar - Shaggy Crazy Horse: Do you have any import options?
11:06, 18 Mar - Shaggy Crazy Horse changed the subject to ‚ÄúExpert CS think tank‚Äù
11:06, 18 Mar - Teegan: Sorry bunny, won't take long I'm sure- but asking these guys seemed like so much of a better option than asking the in house it support, who would spit at me and tell me they could do it next week
11:06, 18 Mar - Owen James: Probably. What program generated your csv file teegs?
11:06, 18 Mar - Bunn: Haha. I was making a joke!
11:07, 18 Mar - Teegan: I have some:
11:07, 18 Mar - Owen James: ???
11:08, 18 Mar - Teegan: <Media omitted>
11:08, 18 Mar - Teegan: Sad to it was excel, O
11:08, 18 Mar - Owen James: That should work
11:08, 18 Mar - Teegan: (You guys are heroes)
11:08, 18 Mar - Owen James: I'm not sure how it will handle row delimeters though
11:09, 18 Mar - Owen James: I don't know or use postges. I just have used csvs a lot in the past.
11:09, 18 Mar - Teegan: I did the same process with another excel csv and it worked a charm
11:09, 18 Mar - Owen James: Cool.
11:09, 18 Mar - Owen James: So no problem anymore?
11:09, 18 Mar - Teegan: No, there is a problem with this one
11:10, 18 Mar - Shaggy Crazy Horse: Go to file options
11:11, 18 Mar - Teegan: <Media omitted>
11:11, 18 Mar - Shaggy Crazy Horse: Encoding empty?
11:11, 18 Mar - Owen James: Utf8
11:11, 18 Mar - Owen James: That should work.
11:12, 18 Mar - Shaggy Crazy Horse: Clearly not UTF8 given the error
11:12, 18 Mar - Owen James: I am pretty sure csvs are utf8
11:12, 18 Mar - Owen James: Oh yeah.
11:12, 18 Mar - Owen James: Odd.
11:13, 18 Mar - Shaggy Crazy Horse: Can you export csv again?
11:13, 18 Mar - Teegan: The file is in French so contains accents- looking at
Stackoverflow etc I thought that might be messing stuff up...?
11:13, 18 Mar - Mike: The error looks like it was missing the commas
11:13, 18 Mar - Shaggy Crazy Horse: So probably IS in UTF8
11:14, 18 Mar - Teegan: Looking at it in notepad there aren't any commas around null values
11:14, 18 Mar - Owen James: Open it in excel and then save with a known encoding.
11:15, 18 Mar - Shaggy Crazy Horse: Go to null options
11:15, 18 Mar - Owen James: There wouldn't be.
11:17, 18 Mar - Teegan: <Media omitted>
11:18, 18 Mar - Shaggy Crazy Horse: How is null shown in csv?
11:18, 18 Mar - Owen James: Depends. Normally just blank , , sometimes , "",
11:18, 18 Mar - Teegan: <Media omitted>
11:19, 18 Mar - Teegan: Blank here
11:19, 18 Mar - Owen James: Yeah
11:19, 18 Mar - Shaggy Crazy Horse: That's fine. You have a header in file though and it's not ticked in misc options
11:19, 18 Mar - Teegan: Don't worry, it's not very confidential
11:20, 18 Mar - Teegan: So header file ticked and utf8 encoding?
11:21, 18 Mar - Shaggy Crazy Horse: Encoding should be detected automatically. It's could also be UTF16 or some other numbers, try with it blank doff auto detection
11:21, 18 Mar - Teegan: Both give the same error as before
11:22, 18 Mar - Owen James: What is on trans_customer line 2?
11:23, 18 Mar - Owen James: You might have an invalid charcter or something?
11:24, 18 Mar - Teegan: Trans_customer is the table I'm importing into... so there's nothing there yet...
11:24, 18 Mar - Owen James: is that the whole table or one of the headings?
11:25, 18 Mar - Teegan: I'll check my table defs
11:25, 18 Mar - Teegan: Whole table
11:25, 18 Mar - Mike: Do any of your columns have commas in them?
12:14, 18 Mar - Shaggy Crazy Horse changed the subject to ‚ÄúThe horde‚Äù
11:25, 18 Mar - Mike: To be safe you should put quotes around strings when you save them to csv
11:26, 18 Mar - Shaggy Crazy Horse: Excel will do that for you
11:26, 18 Mar - Teegan: Good point- some of the character ones do. .. I don't know if it's got as far as reading those though
11:26, 18 Mar - Teegan: Ok
11:26, 18 Mar - Shaggy Crazy Horse: Trying playing around with the encoding in file options
11:26, 18 Mar - Shaggy Crazy Horse: Try*
11:27, 18 Mar - Owen James: Not always shaggy.  It's an option. An option that it doesn't look like it was ticked judging by the notepad screenshot.
11:27, 18 Mar - Teegan: Good detdctive work y'all- would I do that when I save?
11:28, 18 Mar - Shaggy Crazy Horse: Not on my excel, maybe yours is rustic
11:28, 18 Mar - Owen James: Try reexporting your csv from excel teegs. Choose a known haracter encoding and tick whatever option it is to put inverted commas around strings. It might be called encapsulate strings.
11:29, 18 Mar - Teegan: Ok,  I'm hoping to have a play
11:30, 18 Mar - Owen James: Oh you are right. Excel 2010 doesn't have that.
11:30, 18 Mar - Teegan: I am in office 13, and I don't seem to have options when I export
11:31, 18 Mar - Teegan: Stoopid microsoft taking away my autonomy
11:32, 18 Mar - Owen James: Hmm. I just tried it out and shaggy is right. On newer versions of excel it automatically adds " where necessary.
11:32, 18 Mar - Teegan: Oh. Then clever Microsoft.
11:52, 18 Mar - Teegan: Thanks anyway guys-I'll owe you a pint for the half hour of work time I just stole from you
11:53, 18 Mar - Owen James: Im home ill anyway.

18:15, 18 Mar - Dave Mendez: How goes your leaving Tegs? Did you recover your passport? X
19:09, 18 Mar - Teegan: Passport recovered, leaving underway. I have once again arrived at Heathrow early to find that there is nothing in my pay bracket to distract me.  Grue. Still, dinner on its way- let the expensing commence! X
19:10, 18 Mar - Shaggy Crazy Horse: Wait what? You didn't fly yesterday?
19:11, 18 Mar - Teegan: My passport was in Belgium! Fail. But all sorted now.
19:11, 18 Mar - Teegan: Tonight we fly
19:11, 18 Mar - Shaggy Crazy Horse: Why?
19:12, 18 Mar - Teegan: I'm going to Mali after I'm done in Tanzania, for which I belatedly realised I needed a visa. Their closest embassy is in Belgium, so I sent my passport of last week... But failed to book a return courier

12:01, 24 Mar - Bunn: Is that how sausage dogs sit??
13:34, 24 Mar - Owen James: The sum of all the natural numbers is equal to (-1/12). This is crazy! Mathematicians arise and explain!
13:37, 24 Mar - Slam: What do you mean by natural numbers? It usually refers to counting numbers, which you can't sum
13:37, 24 Mar - Owen James: 1+2+3+4......
13:38, 24 Mar - Slam: You can't sum that, you can sum OVER the natural numbers, but you can't add them
13:39, 24 Mar - Owen James: Why not?
13:39, 24 Mar - Slam: Email me whatever you're looking at, before Bunn notices there's maths on the horde
13:40, 24 Mar - Owen James: Numberphile sum of natural numbers youtube.
13:46, 24 Mar - Owen James: There are two proofs.  One of which uses the reimann zeta function.
13:52, 24 Mar - Mike: Lol, bad horde chat. If you analytically continue the Riemann zeta function and evaluate at -1 that's what you get. Kinda cheating though. As written the series is clearly divergent.
13:58, 24 Mar - Owen James: I don't really get what makes a series divegent though. Because 1/1+1/2+1/3 +1/4... is divergent. Even though it feels like it shouldn't be.
13:59, 24 Mar - Owen James: Why is it cheating?
14:04, 24 Mar - Mike: This is quite complicated... Zeta(x) is well defined for real x>1. For x<= 1 the series is not convergent. There's a thing called analytic continuation where roughly you find a function which agrees with your function where it is defined and is analytic (read infinitely differentiable) on a compact subset of the complex numbers.
14:06, 24 Mar - Mike: But the analytic continuation is not the same as the original function. So it doesn't make sense to use the series definition of zeta for x<1 and say zeta(-1) = 1+2+3+....
14:10, 24 Mar - Owen James: That is what they guy did in the video.  He did zeta(2) and then took away 2.zeta (-2) or something.  I forget exactly how he did it. It feels like cheating.
14:14, 24 Mar - Mike: We should start a nerd horde group or something...
14:15, 24 Mar - Owen James: Nah. Let the prols that inhabit this thread learn something.
14:16, 24 Mar - Owen James: Also apparently 1-1+1-1+1-1.... is divergent.  Which makes no sense!
14:24, 24 Mar - Dave Mendez: Well it doesn't converge to anything. Depending on how you cluster the sums it appears it could converge to 0 or 1. In general for an infinite series to be convergent the underlying sequence being summed must converge to zero.
14:26, 24 Mar - Slam: It's been ages since we've had a pointlessly nerdy argument about something, it's not a much fun sober and writing, let's get drunk and do this again sometime

10:36, 30 Mar - Mike: I just made it look like we stole your hat and left it at the park because it pleased me
10:36, 30 Mar - Teegan: Sweet. Go with my blessing. And your hat :)

16:25, 31 Mar - Owen James: Nah I'll just stay at home. I have way too much work to do.

14:00, 1 Apr - Slam: Haha nice one! Was that on look mum no hands? Love that place, they fixed up my breaks for free
18:10, 1 Apr - Vanessa "Beast" Matthews: I could kill for a coffee

19:40, 1 Apr - Bunn: Loving how light it still is!
19:42, 1 Apr - Vanessa "Beast" Matthews: Are you still at the pub?
19:42, 1 Apr - Dave Mendez: Yea

09:31, 2 Apr - Mike: Odysseus would be proud. Excellent burgering y'all

09:47, 2 Apr - Slam: Yeah, drink until the sensible people have gone home!
18:44, 2 Apr - Bunn: If anyone wants a taste card for ¬£30 instead of ¬£80 use code MENU8
Plus you get a free ¬£23 cork screw!
18:45, 2 Apr - Bunn: <Media omitted>
18:52, 2 Apr - Mike: Man what does a ¬£23 corkscrew look like?
18:53, 2 Apr - Mike: Couldn't you buy a robot butler for that kind of money?
19:44, 2 Apr - Shaggy Crazy Horse: 29.99 + 3xFREE = 102.99
19:44, 2 Apr - Shaggy Crazy Horse: That's math
20:23, 2 Apr - Bongo: That's numberwang
20:23, 2 Apr - Bongo: What's a taste card?
22:27, 2 Apr - Bunn: 50% off at certain restaurants
22:27, 2 Apr - Bunn: Like chico banditos
09:50, 3 Apr - Marth: Dave & Mike - from our discussion the other night: you can infer the (fact-checked) arguments for and against EU here: http://www.buzzfeed.com/owenspottiswoode/12-things-we-learned-from-nick-clegg-and-nigel-far-nmzm?s=mobile
09:56, 3 Apr - Dave Mendez: Cheers Marth. God bless the facts. X
10:06, 3 Apr - Owen James: Interesting. Apparently like 70% people think farage won the debate according to the guardian.
10:08, 3 Apr - Owen James: I personally don't care. I just don't think that in a democracy politicians really have that much power. Gove is trying his best to fuck up education and still isn't really making a dent.
10:32, 3 Apr - Dave Mendez: From all accounts I'm reading Andrew Lansley's Health and Social Care Act has essentially privatised the NHS. I'd keep my eyes on politicians - it's when we stop watching them that the shit hits the fan.
10:34, 3 Apr - Owen James: What yah gonna do. As long as I don't have to pay for health insurance.
10:34, 3 Apr - Owen James: Which I never will. If any politician suggested such a thing there would be a recall election or a vote of no confidence.
11:30, 3 Apr - Vanessa "Beast" Matthews: I'm looking for new tunes, anybody have any suggestions?
11:32, 3 Apr - Owen James: Sting and The Police!
11:32, 3 Apr - Owen James: Blondie
11:32, 3 Apr - Owen James: Eric satie
11:33, 3 Apr - Owen James: Yes
11:33, 3 Apr - Owen James: Rush
11:42, 3 Apr - ‚Ä™+44 7807 744465‚Ä¨: Hiatus kaiyote
11:42, 3 Apr - ‚Ä™+44 7807 744465‚Ä¨: Moonchild
11:53, 3 Apr - Vanessa "Beast" Matthews: Thanks!
18:37, 3 Apr - Mike: Thanks for the link Marth. My gut definitely says it would be dumb to leave the EU, but all the arguments I see either for or against it seem very vague and notional...
18:38, 3 Apr - Mike: Also I reckon the yougov poll was probly skewed by the fact that people hate clegg
19:11, 3 Apr - Owen James: I would like to see stats on how much import and export tax is saved by being in the EU.
19:12, 3 Apr - Owen James: Also I think the reasons for being part of it are vague and complicated whereas the reasons for not being part basically boil down to saving a small amount of money and stopping immigration.
19:16, 3 Apr - Owen James: I am fairly sure I am pro EU not because of its benefits (I don't really know what they are) but because I don't think the arguments against it are compelling. I am basically anti xenophobe. And apparently included in that set is being pro European union.
20:06, 3 Apr - Teegan: I am pro eu because I fully dig passing through Borders with no problems
20:07, 3 Apr - Teegan: Liberte! Egalite! Fraternite!
20:07, 3 Apr - Teegan: (No accents, sorry French)
20:13, 3 Apr - Owen James: I agree with you. That seems like a pretty small reason. I am fairly sure the EU is actually fairly inconsequential though.
20:14, 3 Apr - Teegan: It feels like the closest thing to idealism which we still have a commitment to
21:29, 3 Apr - Slam: Arguing against the eu just feels like xenophobic atavism, I'd love it if there were poignant arguments for Britain to be a member for itself, but I feel completely happy with the idea that we make a net loss, with a huge gain in other countries
21:29, 3 Apr - Slam: Looking over the history of colonial Britain, I think we owe the world a bit
21:34, 3 Apr - Alan Wright: The only way human society can overcome the worlds problems (environment, war, inequality, crime, etc) is through political globalisation. The eu is a big step in that direction. Even if Britain gained did gain by leaving the eu, theres bigger issues at play here than just being 1 or 2% wealthier.
21:35, 3 Apr - Alan Wright: Anyone around for post work beers tomorrow night?
21:35, 3 Apr - Mike: I don't know that immigration is good for other countries though. Seems like a lot of poorer countries lose a lot of bright people that way
21:41, 3 Apr - Mike: Beers beers beers. Just saw your email, Alan, where are you guys off to?
21:54, 3 Apr - Alan Wright: Vietnam (probably).  To Danang
00:11, 4 Apr - Teegan: Waaaah

22:50, 11 May - Shaggy Crazy Horse: I thought it was ninth
23:25, 11 May - ‚Ä™+44 7807 744465‚Ä¨: End of the week meant Sunday not Friday I think xx
07:37, 12 May - Mike: Quote from the review of the Postman Pat movie I just read:
07:37, 12 May - Mike: "The murderous bionic cat shooting lasers out of its eyes proved a turning point"
10:37, 12 May - Bongo: Lol sounds intriguing
10:57, 12 May - ‚Ä™+44 7807 744465‚Ä¨: My aunt is one of the original illustrators of postman pat books :)
11:03, 12 May - Owen James: Big deal! My aunt is that bionic lazer eye cat!

12:03, 12 May - Mike: They're good at operating on cataracts
12:03, 12 May - Mike: I feel dirty about that last post

12:13, 12 May - ‚Ä™+44 7545 989149‚Ä¨: So who else heard very bad reviews of Godzilla?
12:14, 12 May - ‚Ä™+44 7545 989149‚Ä¨: I hope its a big plan to lower my Godzilla sized expectations, before absolutely smashing them later...
12:19, 12 May - Mike: 85% on rotten tomatoes
12:22, 12 May - ‚Ä™+44 7545 989149‚Ä¨: I saw a couple of 2 star reviews knocking about. Might be people who accidentally watched the Matthew Broderick version though...
12:23, 12 May - Mike: I must be the only one who liked that film
12:23, 12 May - Mike: It had bloody Godzilla in it. People are too fussy.
12:38, 12 May - Owen James: I'm the same mike.
12:40, 12 May - ‚Ä™+44 7545 989149‚Ä¨: I went to see it in the cinema for my birthday. Thought it was great. Haven't seen it since though...
12:40, 12 May - Owen James: Eliza keeps trying to tell me its a bad film but we always come back to its one redeaming feature.  It has godzilla in it. Seriously godzilla adds about the same amount to a film as a film being the film taxi driver adds to a film.
12:41, 12 May - Owen James: Dan it had gozilla in it. Therefore it was great!
12:42, 12 May - ‚Ä™+44 7545 989149‚Ä¨: I thought I might have imagined that in my 11 year old birthday excitement and sugar rush.
12:42, 12 May - ‚Ä™+44 7545 989149‚Ä¨: Glad to hear it was real.
13:53, 12 May - Shaggy Crazy Horse: If rotten tomatoes says it's good then I'm going to hate that film. Joy
17:31, 12 May - ‚Ä™+44 7807 744465‚Ä¨: Hi guys is anyone back at canning town yet? Shaggy is at drumming till later but I wanna come for meat Monday within the next hour. Will anyone be there to let me in? Will anyone talk to me?
17:32, 12 May - Mike: Phil'll be in, he doesn't check WhatsApp much tho
17:33, 12 May - Shaggy Crazy Horse: Or door bell.
17:39, 12 May - Mike: If you do decide to climb the fence, be careful of the barbed wire
17:56, 12 May - p tschismarov: I'm here. I'll let you in.
19:21, 12 May - Marth: On my way! 40mins x

10:25, 13 May - Slam: Homemade burgers? Or did you find some secret Burgeria?
11:54, 13 May - p tschismarov: Mike is referring to the thick slabs of pork that were marinating the entire day. They were crazy tasty. Def getting the meat from the morrisons butchers from now on.
12:59, 13 May - Slam: Sounds most boday, sorry I missed it!
13:00, 13 May - Slam: Is there any left? Sounds like a perfect post climbing snack, if it survives that long
13:17, 13 May - p tschismarov: I reckon I'll turn the leftovers into some kind of pie tonite. Can't guarantee how long it'll survive tho.
13:42, 13 May - Teegan: Mmmmmmpie
13:42, 13 May - Teegan: Yo slam- what is the branding on your vapour tool guy? Why is it better than cheaper ones?
15:02, 13 May - Slam: Truvape is the name of the flame, I did zero research into it except trying Nialls once, so there's probably a better product out there
15:03, 13 May - Slam: If you think it it a buying 4 packs it cigarettes, which will last about 2 months, it makes the thing seen really cheap though, and they've got food customer service so far. I'm a fan
15:03, 13 May - Slam: Mmmmpie sounds delicious, I'll get the climbing out the way asap
15:53, 13 May - Shaggy Crazy Horse: Please disable swype, you type like a crazy tape worm on a dance machine
16:10, 13 May - Owen James: Swype increases speed by 50%. But you end up having to explain more than half your mesages so it saves no time in the long run.
16:54, 13 May - p tschismarov: Only if you're a Diaz
16:57, 13 May - Slam: Wood

12:23, 16 May - p tschismarov: There's other parks? Something easy for people to reach. Maybe near London bridge.
12:45, 16 May - Slam: Sounds good, don't think I'm getting out before 6.30, let's do new change on a mid week evening so we've got a chance of a seat
13:37, 16 May - Shaggy Crazy Horse: Park sounds lush, unfortunately there's not much around London bridge, kennington park is nice
14:00, 16 May - Slam: What about that little one by borough? We'd have the glad when things get dingy
14:02, 16 May - Shaggy Crazy Horse: There are a few small parks around, they are not wonderful but some are quite homely.

08:53, 28 May - Slam: So I've bought some mud guards that don't fit my bike, anyone have a mountain bike that needs some? Free to a good home
09:57, 28 May - Owen James: God damn you Sam you sneaky bastard! I just figured out why my phone keyboard was behaving so weirdly!!!
10:14, 28 May - Slam: Mwahahahah! Also, I got the reddit app, win all round!
10:34, 28 May - Angela: I'm intrigued, what happened to your keyboard??
10:57, 28 May - Henry Franks: dont get the reddit app youll never get anything done ever again!
10:58, 28 May - Angela: ...I'm gonna get the reddit app
10:58, 28 May - Bunn: I dont like doing things either
10:58, 28 May - Henry Franks: haha
10:59, 28 May - Slam: Some gangster turned off auto spacing and auto capitalisation, that's what happened
10:59, 28 May - Slam: I feel like I'm graduating Henry, imgur app has taken my hours for too long!
11:01, 28 May - Henry Franks: there is better stuff on reddit, try /r/showerthoughts and /r/Britishproblems
11:03, 28 May - Henry Franks: what tv are ppl watching atm? im stuck at home ill and need something to binge
11:04, 28 May - Angela: Have you watched the US office? Great binging fodder
11:05, 28 May - Henry Franks: Actually I never saw that I always assumed it was rubbish
11:06, 28 May - Angela: Get past the first few episodes, which try to copy the uk one, and then it gets going and is really funny
11:09, 28 May - Owen James: It was some very subtle trolling Sam. I kept just thinking my fingers had got fatter or something.
11:09, 28 May - Owen James: Yeah once you get to the second series it is a lot better.
11:10, 28 May - Owen James: The first series just try to copy the British one. But because they are American they don't seem to get the humor.
11:10, 28 May - Angela: They can't do it half as cringey and awkward
11:11, 28 May - Angela: I liked it from the first few episodes though
11:16, 28 May - Henry Franks: sweet, full day of tv binging sorted
11:31, 28 May - Mike: The toilets at my work are like a Faraday cage, so I can't look at reddit at work without my boss seeing :(
11:32, 28 May - Angela: Your boss sounds creepy!
11:39, 28 May - Bunn: Gross dude
11:39, 28 May - Bunn: My toilet naps would be busted
11:40, 28 May - Bunn: Iv spent the morning listening to GoT audiobooks on youtube
11:40, 28 May - Bunn: So much easier than actually doing the reading
11:45, 28 May - Slam: You're my hero Bunn, taking lethargy to new levels
11:46, 28 May - Slam: You listen while you work? I got a bollocking for wearing headphones once. I need a new job...
11:47, 28 May - Angela: What! I quite often watch tv at work and people are fine with it
11:50, 28 May - Henry Franks: yea you defo need a new job sam, Id go crazy if I couldnt listen to headphones at work!
11:51, 28 May - Bunn: Hope you asked that Q for your new job mate!
12:35, 28 May - Slam: Hah yeah, first thing I asked
12:37, 28 May - Slam: For those bemused, I've got a new job, starting June 23rd, I'm thinking celebration meal on the 19th to ease into tandem festival. Save the date
12:56, 28 May - Mike: Man your old place sounds dumb. Sometimes I just put my headphones in with no sound on, it's better than ambient noise!
13:05, 28 May - Teegan: I want headphones that play silence
13:05, 28 May - Teegan: Then I will know I live in the future
13:11, 28 May - Mike: Noise cancelling headphones aren't that expensive these days, like ¬£40 for a cheap pair?
13:24, 28 May - Shaggy Crazy Horse: Cheap headphones that claim to do expensive things are a waste of money
13:29, 28 May - Mike: I think expensive headphones are a waste of money, there I said it
13:30, 28 May - Shaggy Crazy Horse: Maybe on your ears
13:31, 28 May - Henry Franks: I dunno man good headphones are heavenly,  I used to go thru a pair every six months till I shelled out for good ones, theyve lasted 5 years
13:43, 28 May - Mike: Yeah longevity is a good point. I leave mine at work though, use inner ear on commute, so doesn't matter so much.
13:51, 28 May - Mike: I think audiophiles are kidding themselves though. Its like high end wine tasting.
13:58, 28 May - Slam: I'm pretty sure it's just what your used to, going back to computer speakers when you've been listening to real ones for a little while is painful, you never realise how bad the quality is
14:00, 28 May - Slam: And I'll never forgive Vanessa for educating me about burgers. Now I know what they're supposed to taste like, I can't even finish a McDonald's
14:01, 28 May - Henry Franks: its a hard life bro
14:12, 28 May - Bunn: That was her plan all alonh
14:12, 28 May - Bunn: Along*
14:12, 28 May - Bunn: You got schooled sukka
14:17, 28 May - Bunn: Legend goes shaggy had 3 maccyD bfasts on monday
14:17, 28 May - Bunn: And he doesnt remember it
15:01, 28 May - Mike: He didn't give me any
15:01, 28 May - Mike: Bastard
15:16, 28 May - Owen James: So it turns out that although your bosses seem to not want you taking a shit or wearing headphones they are perfectly happy with you spending the day on wassap Óêï
15:19, 28 May - Slam: Hah, I was just thinking the same, think I need to turn my phone off for the afternoon
15:21, 28 May - Bongo: Yea TL;DR
15:22, 28 May - Bongo: They need some sort of summarising feature to condense all of today's messages into a one liner
15:23, 28 May - Mike: In a meeting lol
15:24, 28 May - Mike: A really long boring one
16:31, 28 May - Teegan: Noise cancelling headphones cancel out amvient noise when you're playing music
16:31, 28 May - Teegan: I just want them to play silence
16:31, 28 May - Teegan: Deafening silence
16:32, 28 May - Teegan: Arthur c clarke wrote about it many years ago and they still haven't been invented
16:32, 28 May - Teegan: Sci fi fail
16:38, 28 May - ‚Ä™+44 7794 501335‚Ä¨: Hey guys. Having drinks and dinner on the southbank later if anyone's up for it! Cxx

17:28, 28 May - Owen James: You could get noise cancelling headphones and play that silent John Cage symphony teens.
17:28, 28 May - Owen James: Tees.

19:57, 28 May - Owen James: I'm at South bank where are peeps?
19:58, 28 May - Owen James: Also those album recommendations were rubbish. I ended up having to listen to the John Cage silent symphony.
20:14, 28 May - Bongo: Do you like mellow stuff?
20:16, 28 May - Bongo: Wax tailor or hundred waters
20:16, 28 May - Bongo: Any of their albums

12:20, 29 May - Angela: I might be. A couple of vague plans which may not happen. Where are you thinking?
12:27, 29 May - Alan Wright: Anything goes really. Perhaps one of the pubs on the river near lb?
12:30, 29 May - Angela: Sounds lovely. If my work drinks don't materialise (pretty likely) and jason hasn't bought us tickets to the cinema already (semi-likely as he's very excited about xmen) then I'm in!

09:09, 30 May - Teegan: Even 24 is a bit sparse
09:11, 30 May - Mike: There were about 8 when I joined it was just C town Hannah and cate I think
09:13, 30 May - Teegan: Rubbish horde
09:13, 30 May - Teegan: Lovely group of people
09:14, 30 May - Slam: That made a posse at most
09:14, 30 May - Shaggy Crazy Horse: That was my hoard. Now it's my horde
09:15, 30 May - Mike: Can one of the original peeps do me a favour? Go to main menu, click on three dots, settings, chat settings, email conversation and email the whole horde chat as a text file to me?
09:16, 30 May - Mike: Mine only goes back to when I broke my phone, wana do some stats on it!
09:17, 30 May - ‚Ä™+44 7807 744465‚Ä¨: Stats mike?
09:18, 30 May - Bunn: <Media omitted>
09:18, 30 May - Mike: Yeah it is kind of my job lol
09:18, 30 May - Mike: Lol I meant stats not alcoholism
09:19, 30 May - Bunn: Unrelated pic but funny
09:20, 30 May - Bunn: Got a spare ticket to see the glitch mob at the forum tonight
09:20, 30 May - Bunn: Anyone interested?
09:20, 30 May - Angela: I'm interested in that leaflet...
09:28, 30 May - Shaggy Crazy Horse: Lol
09:54, 30 May - Slam: I sent something Mike, don't know if it's what you're after!
10:37, 30 May - Teegan: http://www.wageningenur.nl/en/Expertise-Services/Research-Institutes/lei/show/Significantly-fewer-pigs-castrated-over-the-past-five-years.htm
10:37, 30 May - Teegan: Best headline I've seen in a whole
10:37, 30 May - Teegan: While
10:37, 30 May - Teegan: I like my job :)
10:39, 30 May - Owen James: Mike you should do stats on who comments most. And who gets mentioned most. Then do the ratio of the two. Then we could finally have what we all have been waiting for: an objective measure of who is the most popular.
10:39, 30 May - Henry Franks: haha thats amazing, I didnt realise pig castration came under the remit of your job tegs
10:40, 30 May - Teegan: It's an agile role :)
10:40, 30 May - Shaggy Crazy Horse: Oh snap check who's a twitter celebrity https://mobile.twitter.com/chloelast/media/grid?idx=0&tid=472101577353068544
10:40, 30 May - Henry Franks: surely a normalised number of mentions is better, if you incorporate comment counts then prolific commenters would feature better...and yoid have to take into account time spent in the group too
10:41, 30 May - Teegan: Doing some post workshop networking there shags
10:41, 30 May - Shaggy Crazy Horse: With my coworker lol
10:43, 30 May - Owen James: No Henry. I think the person who doesn't comment much but gets mentioned a lot has the highest comment efficacy. And therefore is the objectively best person.
10:44, 30 May - Teegan: Even if we keep calling them a cunt?
10:44, 30 May - Owen James: Shaggy that link doesn't work for me.  Who is it?
10:44, 30 May - Henry Franks: I think thats an assumption that needs testing before you can claim objectivity :)
10:44, 30 May - Shaggy Crazy Horse: Ce moi
10:45, 30 May - Henry Franks: plus tegs makes a good point how does it take into account sentiment?
10:45, 30 May - Owen James: Owen Owen Owen Owen Owen Owen owen
10:45, 30 May - Shaggy Crazy Horse: Does that count as a self mention? Am I boosting my popularity of self-centredness?
10:45, 30 May - Henry Franks: I wonder what the stats would be for proportion of whatsapping done on fridays
10:46, 30 May - Shaggy Crazy Horse: Or Mondays
10:48, 30 May - Henry Franks: would be quite interesting to do a sentiment analysis by day too, bet were all happier on fridays

18:40, 30 May - Bunn: Contiguous? Great word!

00:16, 3 Jun - Owen James: Doh'
00:16, 3 Jun - ‚Ä™+44 7545 989149‚Ä¨: Yes. Half an hour after you.
00:16, 3 Jun - ‚Ä™+44 7545 989149‚Ä¨: Your cries of Oberyn were... confusing.
00:20, 3 Jun - Slam: My good I miss that guy already
00:21, 3 Jun - Shaggy Crazy Horse: Óçä
00:21, 3 Jun - Shaggy Crazy Horse: OBERGYN
00:22, 3 Jun - Mike: This is the first episode that's made me reconsider whether I should keep watching
00:22, 3 Jun - Mike: I think I'm at a net loss having watched
00:23, 3 Jun - Dave Mendez: Agreed. I just sat out on the steps of the boat in the dark stunned. A duck saved me. Quack.
00:23, 3 Jun - Slam: Obergone
00:24, 3 Jun - Mike: I imagine this is what it feels like to support a shit football team
00:24, 3 Jun - Mike: Like Arsenal
00:27, 3 Jun - Owen James: Shaggy I wish I could upvote your Óçä
00:28, 3 Jun - Eliza Botts: That sounds rude.
06:58, 3 Jun - Mike: Still sulking this morning
06:58, 3 Jun - Mike: Stupid show
07:26, 3 Jun - Owen James: Are you sulking because the mountain was skull king!
08:05, 3 Jun - ‚Ä™+44 7807 744465‚Ä¨: Wake n sulk
08:59, 3 Jun - Bunn: I'm over it already
09:00, 3 Jun - Bunn: Hopefully more badasses from Dorne will show up
09:01, 3 Jun - Owen James: Lets talk about nice things: grey worm has a crush Óêò
09:01, 3 Jun - Owen James: Unfortunately so did obyron.
09:03, 3 Jun - ‚Ä™+44 7807 744465‚Ä¨: Awwww Bunn you were so forlorn last night
09:04, 3 Jun - Bunn: I was Óêì
09:05, 3 Jun - Bunn: Shouldv seen it coming
09:05, 3 Jun - Bunn: Tricked again!
09:07, 3 Jun - Mike: Feel like a beaten housewife who keeps going back
09:08, 3 Jun - Mike: That bug crushing scene was totally about GRRM
09:08, 3 Jun - Mike: WHAT DOES HE GET OUT OF IT?
09:09, 3 Jun - Bunn: Lol
09:09, 3 Jun - Bunn: Good one
11:31, 3 Jun - Bunn: Haha
11:31, 3 Jun - Bunn: Check this
11:31, 3 Jun - Bunn: <Media omitted>
11:33, 3 Jun - Marth: Ew!!! Bunn! I'm trying to forget!!
11:32, 3 Jun - p tschismarov: Where is this from?
11:33, 3 Jun - Bunn: Imgur comments on this pic
11:33, 3 Jun - Bunn: <Media omitted>
11:38, 3 Jun - Owen James: The mountain is fucking scary in real life as well. Obyron is fucking hansome in real life as well.
11:44, 3 Jun - Shaggy Crazy Horse: It's oberyn
11:46, 3 Jun - Owen James: No its oybooring!
11:51, 3 Jun - ‚Ä™+44 7545 989149‚Ä¨: OberWIN! ...Wait....
12:45, 3 Jun - Mike: <Media omitted>
13:46, 3 Jun - Bunn: http://mccomseycomix.files.wordpress.com
13:47, 3 Jun - Bunn: (Rest of comic)
13:52, 3 Jun - Slam: That comic made me sad all over again. Great style though
14:07, 3 Jun - Shaggy Crazy Horse: I like how he went nuts on the audience too
14:10, 3 Jun - Mike: Yeah I read that in the book he cuts a woman in half
14:11, 3 Jun - Mike: Duno why they left that out
14:12, 3 Jun - Slam: Different setup, the cartoon looks more like a street brawl, the show was in a proper stadium
14:14, 3 Jun - Shaggy Crazy Horse: So was the book
14:18, 3 Jun - Slam: Just rewatched that scene, so brutal! Even just the punch would end the fight
14:53, 3 Jun - Teegan: When Mike does the analysis I suspect we'll find that oberyn's head exploding is one of the most impudent events in the history of the horde
14:53, 3 Jun - Teegan: Or indeed in our lives
14:55, 3 Jun - Bunn: Next week is gonna be even better
15:34, 3 Jun - Dave Mendez: I'm expecting oberyn's head to reassemble like the T-1000 before he leads all the women of kings landing into the sea.
15:38, 3 Jun - Owen James: Why would he lead them to sea. Surely he would lead them to his bedroom because he is a massive slut.
15:40, 3 Jun - Vanessa "Beast" Matthews: I had my eyes shut half the episode. Did the big guy also die pretty much a sec after he killed Ob?
15:42, 3 Jun - Dave Mendez: It seems more poetic that way. Pied piper style. Plus he can take them all to the afterlife and slut them there.
15:42, 3 Jun - Dave Mendez: Slut
15:43, 3 Jun - Dave Mendez: What a horrible word
15:43, 3 Jun - ‚Ä™+44 7545 989149‚Ä¨: Try Hussy instead.
15:43, 3 Jun - Dave Mendez: Cheers Dan. He is more of a hussy.
15:47, 3 Jun - Kritzia: I had my eyes shut as well, but the Spanish guy was pretty handsome!! And now I'm kind of getting the story I think!! :(
15:48, 3 Jun - Kritzia: Hopefully he'll be back.from the after life... I'm now interested :p
15:56, 3 Jun - Alan Wright: Hey guys. If anyone is around, me and cat and some random others are going to be having a few beers at the George in London bridge tonight from 7. Come along if you are around! X
16:13, 3 Jun - Shaggy Crazy Horse: Working late, so I might pop around in the evening
17:36, 3 Jun - Slam: Climbing just now, might I over after
17:37, 3 Jun - Slam: *I might
19:06, 3 Jun - Teegan: <Media omitted>
19:06, 3 Jun - Teegan: Check out who is supporting the Richard Hamilton exhibition
19:08, 3 Jun - Marth: Ha.
19:08, 3 Jun - Marth: Nice spot
19:11, 3 Jun - Teegan: Tickled me
19:12, 3 Jun - Angela: Seems perfectly logical to me
19:13, 3 Jun - Owen James: No no no. "The Richard Hamilton" is a rich guy who is really into Richard Hamilton's art. Just like I would be if there was an Owen James that made art. Everyone knows I am THE Owen James

22:41, 3 Jun - ‚Ä™+44 7545 989149‚Ä¨: Just an advert on the tube, making me sad about Oberyn...

23:17, 3 Jun - p tschismarov: Dave your cordial is next level tasty. Nice one.
23:19, 3 Jun - Slam: Agreed! We're chugging and appreciating the delicious taste of childhood
23:51, 3 Jun - Dave Mendez: Glad you like it peeps. Xx
09:12, 4 Jun - Mike: X men this eve?
09:14, 4 Jun - ‚Ä™+44 7502 048124‚Ä¨: Prob not. Looks silly and not in a good way
09:15, 4 Jun - Mike: So's your face
09:17, 4 Jun - ‚Ä™+44 7502 048124‚Ä¨: Good one.
09:18, 4 Jun - Dave Mendez: I hear it's meant to be pretty good.
09:20, 4 Jun - ‚Ä™+44 7502 048124‚Ä¨: Thanks! I'm happy with it.
09:22, 4 Jun - Mike: I thought you liked the last one Lorna?
09:22, 4 Jun - Angela: It's good! I saw it last week
09:22, 4 Jun - Angela: Better than the last one I thought
09:23, 4 Jun - Angela: But you have to have watched first class otherwise it will make no sense at all
09:32, 4 Jun - ‚Ä™+44 7502 048124‚Ä¨: The last one was alright, but I'm a bit over superhero movies now. There's been way too many.
10:20, 4 Jun - Marth: Epic analysis Mike. For info, Shaggy's nicknames also include: mr shag shag, shagshag, and shagaroo.
10:22, 4 Jun - Marth: And now to boost my mentions, popularity and verbose ratings: Martha Martha Martha Martha Martha Martha Martha Martha Martha Martha
10:54, 4 Jun - Mike: Lol shhh. Not making it public til Friday, can't rush these things!
14:49, 4 Jun - Mike: Soooo... who's on for film? Oliza, you still down?
14:53, 4 Jun - Alan Wright: Ag
14:53, 4 Jun - Alan Wright: .Oo
14:53, 4 Jun - Alan Wright: Omza
14:59, 4 Jun - Slam: Tribal, like it
14:59, 4 Jun - Slam: Can't make film though, got some sushi to eat and computer games to play
15:06, 4 Jun - Mike: Fair dos. If anyone wants to go lemme know before 4.30
15:51, 4 Jun - Owen James: I'm out sorry mike. I have an interview for a promotion on Friday and there is quite a bit of preparation I need to do.
15:54, 4 Jun - Slam: You going for that data analysis thing?
16:00, 4 Jun - Owen James: Yep.
16:01, 4 Jun - Owen James: I have to prepare an analysis for it. But the way some of the data is stored is in cell formatting. So I'm going to have to write a format checking VB macro. And VB is shit.
16:03, 4 Jun - Owen James: However I doubt any of the other candidates will go into this much detail so it should give me a boost.
16:03, 4 Jun - Slam: Cool, I love that stuff. Sure you need to get into vb? There's probably a work around in excel
16:03, 4 Jun - Slam: Yeah for sure!
16:04, 4 Jun - Owen James: Nope. Excel doesn't have a getBGColour function. So I'm writing an excel macro, but excel macros are in stupid VB
16:07, 4 Jun - Slam: How many colours? You can filter by colour, it's a bit too manual, but quicker to use that if it's only a couple
16:38, 4 Jun - Shaggy Crazy Horse: Vb is only marginally better than brainfuck in terms of readability, and infinitely worse in functionality
16:49, 4 Jun - Bongo: VisiblyBullshit
16:55, 4 Jun - Owen James: It has so much redundant stuff.
16:56, 4 Jun - Bongo: Drinks at Yager later if anyone's interested
16:56, 4 Jun - Owen James: And no sensible syntax.
16:56, 4 Jun - Owen James: Its fucking doing my head in
17:54, 4 Jun - Owen James: Ha! In your face visual basic I fucking won!! 

Godamn its annoying.

09:32, 6 Jun - p tschismarov: If the weather stays this fine we should go for park wine in the eve.

12:17, 6 Jun - ‚Ä™+44 7807 744465‚Ä¨: Did you urm do this whilst at work?
12:41, 6 Jun - Mike: Did a bit, kind of replaced reddit this week
13:20, 6 Jun - Bunn: A bird shat right on my arm as i cycled to work this morning
13:20, 6 Jun - Bunn: Bastard
13:35, 6 Jun - Mike: Fixed your bike?
13:40, 6 Jun - Teegan: Hey Friday lunchtime rabble, any fun plans for tonight?

14:40, 6 Jun - Marth: Damn I really want to park and wine right now.
14:40, 6 Jun - Marth: Whine
14:42, 6 Jun - p tschismarov: So where's a park that works for errbody?
14:47, 6 Jun - Mike: But Henry, then you'll be able to see how much shit we used to talk about you before you joined
14:50, 6 Jun - Mike: A park near to old St works for me
14:52, 6 Jun - Henry Franks: im surprised there was time in between all of bunns pictures
14:53, 6 Jun - Angela: I want to park and wine too! Instead I'm going to Birmingham for work :( I bet it's grey there too, it's practically in the north
16:00, 6 Jun - Shaggy Crazy Horse: I'm going to park near borough with work peeps
16:07, 6 Jun - Mike: Works for me, which one?
16:11, 6 Jun - Slam: ...awkward
16:20, 6 Jun - Teegan: What's awkward?

16:31, 6 Jun - Teegan: Ah
16:31, 6 Jun - Teegan: Just read that she can't leave the house.  Doh.
16:31, 6 Jun - Henry Franks: will do! shes going a little insane being stuck in so well be out when its healed!
16:32, 6 Jun - Henry Franks: ha yea! according to the physio even just having the weigjt of her arm while standing up is enough to exacerbate it...
16:32, 6 Jun - Teegan: Sounds nasty
16:39, 6 Jun - Bongo: How did she manage to fuck it up so bad?
16:39, 6 Jun - Henry Franks: she tried to do a single pullup...
16:49, 6 Jun - Shaggy Crazy Horse: Lol
16:49, 6 Jun - Shaggy Crazy Horse: I'm probably going to mint street park

01:01, 14 Jun - Dave Mendez: Hey you sexy creatures. I think we'll be moving the boat tomorrow from kings cross to trendy trendy east London. Of anyone wants to joins us for the cruise you are very welcome. Xx
01:01, 14 Jun - ‚Ä™+44 7502 048124‚Ä¨: ÓÑÖ
01:02, 14 Jun - ‚Ä™+44 7502 048124‚Ä¨: Yes. Probably.
09:02, 14 Jun - Bunn: Yep
09:36, 14 Jun - Henry Franks: where in east you headed?
09:44, 14 Jun - Wills: Can we drive?? Just for a bit?
10:04, 14 Jun - Bunn: Canning Town visitors. We will be showing all world cup matches today so come round whenever.
10:04, 14 Jun - Bunn: Jubilee line is shut from london bridge so get dlr
11:11, 14 Jun - Dave Mendez: Urrgh, just got up. I'll let y'all know what's happening with boat once the world makes sense again. Xx
11:13, 14 Jun - Angela: Was just reading an article about zombies when that flashed at the top of my screen so your urrgh had extreme zombie properties when I read it
11:13, 14 Jun - Slam: Hehe, how's that early start coming on? X
11:42, 14 Jun - Wills: Dave - it doesn't sound like you're in any fit state to drive... Worse, if Angela's suspicions are correct, you may be a zombie, and we all know that zombies shouldn't drive (they never check their mirrors)... Will you need Sam and I to come and navigate stellar eastwards for the day? We can buy sailor hats! X
11:44, 14 Jun - Angela: I can confirm dave's undead status (in my mind) - adam you'll have to hurry to save tegan before it's too late!
11:49, 14 Jun - Wills: I assume it's too late for poor young teegz! (@T: sorry hun!) Plus, with two undead aboard the boat, it strengthens the argument that Sam and I should drive (which, under other circumstances may otherwise be a relatively weak argument)
11:49, 14 Jun - Henry Franks: "may"
11:56, 14 Jun - Slam: I dig that you're doing the pre-apocalypse research Angie, when the time comes your house well be the first stop
12:04, 14 Jun - Dave Mendez: Tegan has pacified me with strawberries so no flesh eating this morning. I accept your argument Adam, if you fancy some cruising come on over.
12:05, 14 Jun - Dave Mendez: Henry, I'm not sure how far east we'll go. Perhaps only to angel but possibly to Hoxton.
12:06, 14 Jun - Dave Mendez: How're you doing Sam? You were at least as drunk as me last night.
12:08, 14 Jun - Wills: Yessss... My work is done. Am on my way!
12:54, 14 Jun - Slam: I woke up in a strange place staring right into the cold depths of shaggy's eyes
12:54, 14 Jun - Slam: The days picking up though

20:35, 14 Jun - Bunn: So who can we expect to join us for the match tonight?

16:57, 16 Jun - Angela: Twitter always knows...
16:57, 16 Jun - Owen James: I'm in Wallington. The train keeps stopping for 10 minutes at each station. Apparently there is congestion.
16:58, 16 Jun - Angela: https://twitter.com/redhilltravel/status/478564810553315329
17:05, 16 Jun - Owen James: Cheers Angela!

19:55, 16 Jun - ‚Ä™+44 7545 989149‚Ä¨: It's mid transformation. I'm pushing for a Castle Black theme, but Lyd has vetoed that.
19:56, 16 Jun - Vanessa "Beast" Matthews: I'm going to have to bail on this one
22:50, 16 Jun - Shaggy Crazy Horse: Doesn't that mean no women allowed? I can see why
10:07, 17 Jun - Dave Mendez: Who is up for Stonehenge this Friday? Plan is to get a train after work, party with the druids til sunrise, snooze under a tree by Salisbury cathedral then shimmy back on Saturday early afternoon.
10:08, 17 Jun - Dave Mendez: If we go as a group the train is just under ¬£30 return. Coach to the stones is ¬£5-10. Hugging the stones... Priceless.
10:15, 17 Jun - Vanessa "Beast" Matthews: I'm interested but my work finishes at 7pm and I need to be back for 11am work on Sat. I was thinking training it
10:17, 17 Jun - ‚Ä™+44 7807 744465‚Ä¨: And I'm gonna chip in here and say - big up those who are coming to tandem festival. The camp site opens at 5pm so my gang are looking to leave London around 3.30pm if y'all's wanna join! Bus or train? We can't decide. Other info: all food on site will be veggie and vegan so bring ham if you are that way inclined. Bring alcohol in plastic bottles/cans. No glass. No naked flames - but there will be a massive bonfire in the evenings for chillin.
10:18, 17 Jun - Angela: I would love to Dave but it's Jason's birthday on Friday and we have plans for the evening. What time are you gonna head down?
10:18, 17 Jun - ‚Ä™+44 7807 744465‚Ä¨: Got a spare ticket going for tandem fest cheap if anyone's up for it. Going for the Friday and Saturday eve, back Sunday morn/early noon. Scarlett band is on at 9pm xx
10:19, 17 Jun - Slam: That 5pm Friday Han? Me n Bongo were hoping to head down that morning to set up, possible? X
10:26, 17 Jun - ‚Ä™+44 7807 744465‚Ä¨: That 5pm Friday for camp site opening. So that morning a lil early
10:27, 17 Jun - ‚Ä™+44 7807 744465‚Ä¨: But I could ask my friend who runs it anyway - let me get back to you
10:27, 17 Jun - Owen James: Sorry dave and hannah me and Eliza are in Brighton this weekend.
10:28, 17 Jun - Slam: No worries, thought there might be stuff going on that day, if not we'll had for 5 instead
10:38, 17 Jun - Dave Mendez: @V - those times could work, though getting back for 11 would mean leaving Salisbury at around 9 which is certainly possible. Is there any chance you can start a little later?
10:39, 17 Jun - Vanessa "Beast" Matthews: Unfortunately no :( I can head back on my own, but not sure what that would mean for the group tickets
10:42, 17 Jun - Dave Mendez: Good point. I don't mind heading back early, I've snoozed in Salisbury plenty.
10:43, 17 Jun - Dave Mendez: @ Angie: heading down sometime after 7 on Friday.
12:44, 17 Jun - Kritzia: hellooo!!! So today is Mex vs Brazil match! It's going to be amaziing and loud!!

12:55, 17 Jun - Bunn: Go Brazil!!!
12:57, 17 Jun - Kritzia: Baby there's a chance that you won't be able to get in!! If that happens just try the other door ;)

13:23, 17 Jun - Bongo: Haha sure ;), sounds good though, I'll probably head over after work to get there for 7ish
13:25, 17 Jun - ‚Ä™+44 7807 744465‚Ä¨: News just in for tandem festival - you can arrive earlier than 5 but you may well get roped into helping to set things up (putting up poles and the like).
13:29, 17 Jun - Kritzia: Coool!! the place is tiny there's a bar & a restaurant... Go to the bar I'll be around screaming my lungs out!! Just follow the noice ;)
13:34, 17 Jun - Mike: If Brazil came second in their group that would be a lot better for us...

19:41, 17 Jun - Bunn: Are you just outside the door?
19:43, 17 Jun - Slam: Yeah! Which part are you in?
19:44, 17 Jun - Bunn: In the upstairs part. They say they'll let more people in when the queue for tacos dies down
19:44, 17 Jun - Bunn: And disperses a bit more
19:44, 17 Jun - Vanessa "Beast" Matthews: Is there any point of me coming if it's already full?
19:45, 17 Jun - Bunn: Depends if being surrounded by mexicans is your thing
19:48, 17 Jun - Slam: Yeah! They're letting people in, just real slow
19:48, 17 Jun - Slam: If you can't get in, we'll go somewhere else x

10:16, 6 Jul - ‚Ä™+44 7502 048124‚Ä¨: Costa Rica have a player called Johnny a Costa. I think he made it up to sound Costa Rican
10:16, 6 Jul - Shaggy Crazy Horse: He was really a Dutch player sabotaging Costa Rica from the inside

15:55, 7 Jul - Mike: There were two that were so far out in front it was silly. Then an insane stampede about a minute later
15:56, 7 Jul - Mike: There were lots of jeeps going past blaring out French commentary
15:57, 7 Jul - Mike: The weirdest thing was how color coordinated it all looked, it was like the Warriors or something
15:59, 7 Jul - Shaggy Crazy Horse: Those two at the front were being chased by the rest
16:22, 7 Jul - Angela: I saw it last year - they all cycle crazy close together at insane speed.
16:31, 7 Jul - Mike: Yeah its nuts. I think 90% of the riders went past me in one 2 second interval
16:39, 7 Jul - Vanessa "Beast" Matthews: It's best to watch in Paris because at least you get to see the tops of their helmets a few times when they repeat the circuit
16:40, 7 Jul - Bunn: I have decided that the sensation of being a spectator at the TdF is not to watch the cycling
16:41, 7 Jul - Bunn: But to witness the speed they go at
16:41, 7 Jul - Angela: Definitely agree!
16:42, 7 Jul - Angela: And to imagine what would happen if two crashed - it'd be the worlds most spectacular dominoes

11:36, 8 Jul - Teegan: Yeah
12:53, 8 Jul - Slam: Game on! I've got to head home and pack first, if anyone could get there a bit early and exist in a space, I'll be there for 9
12:56, 8 Jul - Teegan: What a thing to ask! I hate existing in space.
13:01, 8 Jul - Slam: But you do it with such aplomb, a true blue natural exister
13:01, 8 Jul - Shaggy Crazy Horse: I can be there in time but not space
13:17, 8 Jul - Teegan: Which makes you conceptually very interesting, but terrible company
13:39, 8 Jul - ‚Ä™+44 7807 744465‚Ä¨: Hear hear
13:59, 8 Jul - p tschismarov: Dang, this was my time to shine. Existing is what I do best.
18:10, 8 Jul - Teegan: What time are people who exist in both space and time likely to show up, given that they're not in Brussels?
18:18, 8 Jul - Mike: I'm in Euston now, heading over to Old St
18:21, 8 Jul - Slam: Home, pack, over, 8.30 for me x
18:23, 8 Jul - Bunn: Its a bit hard to find. But its round the corner from kick bar. Under the railway bridges. The door in the wall is fat ronaldos
18:23, 8 Jul - Bunn: Not obvious cos its a popup
18:23, 8 Jul - Bunn: But they've put up posters with arrows on
18:25, 8 Jul - Shaggy Crazy Horse: It's pretty hard to miss

21:35, 8 Jul - Shaggy Crazy Horse: 6-5 to Brazil
21:35, 8 Jul - Slam: 6-5 Brazil, last one in added time
21:38, 8 Jul - Slam: Brazil play best on the back foot, they've got Germany right where they want them
21:42, 8 Jul - Mike: Germany just sliced off Brazil's back foot, then used it to score a goal against them

21:56, 8 Jul - Slam: Huzzah!
21:56, 8 Jul - Slam: Byob

22:51, 8 Jul - Mike: 7-1 called it! It was obvious... Science!
22:51, 8 Jul - Shaggy Crazy Horse: Lol nice
22:51, 8 Jul - Shaggy Crazy Horse: You play the lottery

21:55, 11 Jul - Angela: My work put on a lecture today with my dissertation tutor! Also nostalgic!
22:00, 11 Jul - Dave Mendez: Where did those years go. I feel a powerful urge to go off on an adventure.
22:00, 11 Jul - Dave Mendez: Perhaps I've had too much M&S 'French lager'.
22:01, 11 Jul - Dave Mendez: Which seems like a cultural oxymoron
22:01, 11 Jul - Angela: Haha
22:01, 11 Jul - Angela: I loves me an M&S gin-Tim

10:42, 13 Jul - Owen James: So whats everyone doing for the world cup tonight?
10:42, 13 Jul - ‚Ä™+44 7830 332317‚Ä¨: Crying?
10:45, 13 Jul - ‚Ä™+44 7830 332317‚Ä¨: <Media omitted>
10:48, 13 Jul - Owen James: Haha! I got Germany in the draw so was pretty pleased with that win.
10:57, 13 Jul - ‚Ä™+44 7502 048124‚Ä¨: I've got Argentina in a sweep stake!
11:01, 13 Jul - Owen James: You and me lorna outside now! Oxford rules! First blood wins!
12:53, 13 Jul - Teegan: What area people's plans for the game?
13:22, 13 Jul - Owen James: I was going to do what everyone else was doing!
13:22, 13 Jul - Owen James: It would be good to find a german or argentinian pub
13:23, 13 Jul - Owen James: I think German is more likely
14:07, 13 Jul - ‚Ä™+44 7502 048124‚Ä¨: How was that hackney venue with the mega screen?
14:08, 13 Jul - ‚Ä™+44 7502 048124‚Ä¨: Though its great weather for a BBQ...
14:25, 13 Jul - Teegan: Hackney venue was pretty chilled last time, might be more happening for the final
14:25, 13 Jul - Teegan: They also had a terrible beer selection
14:25, 13 Jul - Teegan: Massive screen though
14:37, 13 Jul - Bongo: I'm not too fussed tbh, I didn't want to see either of these teams play
14:37, 13 Jul - Bunn: Come to ours!
14:37, 13 Jul - Bunn: Cant be arsed to go out to watch the final
14:38, 13 Jul - Bunn: Have so little enthusiasm for germany or argentina
14:39, 13 Jul - Teegan: I think it's unlikely to be a stunning game, given the standard of football so far
14:57, 13 Jul - Owen James: I think Germany have the potential to make something exciting happen. Like 7-1
15:07, 13 Jul - ‚Ä™+44 7502 048124‚Ä¨: Yeah, like 7-1 to Argentina! Ha, smack talk.
15:16, 13 Jul - Owen James: I don't get why people dont think this will be a good game. It is by definition the two best teams in the world!
16:03, 13 Jul - Bunn: I guess you didnt watch the last 2 world cups finals
16:04, 13 Jul - Bunn: Best remembered for Zidane's headbutt, De Jong's flying kick on Alonso. And Van Basten hacking all the Spaniards to pieces
16:05, 13 Jul - Bunn: Could be a good match if they actually play
16:43, 13 Jul - Teegan: The Germans don't play dirty.  And Messi doesn't dive...
17:00, 13 Jul - Owen James: So whats going on tonight then. Are we watching in canning town.
17:03, 13 Jul - Teegan: Sounds right to me
17:03, 13 Jul - Teegan: Are y'all in now? I'm bored of cleaning
17:11, 13 Jul - Owen James: Me and lizard will be there 7ish.
17:21, 13 Jul - ‚Ä™+44 7502 048124‚Ä¨: I'm up for watching it in Canning Town.
18:06, 13 Jul - Mike: Not true, you can't compare Germany and Holland if Germany lose...
18:35, 13 Jul - ‚Ä™+44 7502 048124‚Ä¨: So are people going to c town then? I'll head there now if so.
18:41, 13 Jul - Teegan: O and E are on their way
18:41, 13 Jul - Teegan: I'm still deliberating whether to wait for Dave to get home
18:42, 13 Jul - Teegan: Anyone planning to fire up the barbie?

19:23, 17 Jul - p tschismarov: And if I was shadow minister I would criticise you for not making them backward roll as well.
19:57, 17 Jul - Bongo: And if I were lord speaker, I'd force you both to compete in a forward roll competition
19:58, 17 Jul - Dave Mendez: All of this must, of course, see royal assent and I do believe that the queen is partial to seeing all of parliament forward roll.

10:30, 20 Jul - Angela: Lovely jubbly. Do you have plans for the afternoon/early eve? Currently got the post-holiday lazies so heading out seems much more appealing than unpacking

12:37, 4 Aug - p tschismarov: Eat it before it turns the neighbouring plants red. Domino effect is a Bitch.
20:20, 4 Aug - Bunn: <Media omitted>
20:46, 5 Aug - Slam: Anyone watching the debate? I need to educate myself!
20:51, 5 Aug - Teegan: Can you record it? Does that still happen?
20:51, 5 Aug - Angela: What debate is this?
20:52, 5 Aug - Teegan: Or could iplayer it later in the week?  Would be happy to join you to yaahboo at Alex Salmond
20:52, 5 Aug - Dave Mendez: The summary is that salmond will say lots of optimistic things and darling will say lots of pessimistic things (despite his name).
20:52, 5 Aug - Dave Mendez: It will be unclear who is right
20:53, 5 Aug - Dave Mendez: End result will depend on whether you are optimistic or not
12:35, 6 Aug - Slam: Good debate, felt a lot more like opinions backed by facts, and less like rabble rousing rhetoric than I was expecting
12:35, 6 Aug - Slam: Just saw this a week, guess who made their own outfit from a bin bag
12:35, 6 Aug - Slam: <Media omitted>

10:22, 8 Aug - Shaggy Crazy Horse: Óêí that's so awesome
10:24, 8 Aug - Bunn: Lol
10:42, 8 Aug - Teegan: Yaaaay!
10:43, 8 Aug - Angela: He's dead now.
10:48, 8 Aug - Shaggy Crazy Horse: Because you ate him?
11:00, 8 Aug - Angela: Yeah, poor little guy didn't stand a chance
11:01, 8 Aug - Angela: Far too tasty looking
11:19, 8 Aug - Bunn: Thats what gets for being sad/happy on a friday
11:33, 8 Aug - Kritzia: Hahahaha happyyy üéäüéäÓåíÓåí Friday!!!
11:33, 8 Aug - Kritzia: I don't want to get eaten ;)
14:45, 8 Aug - Shaggy Crazy Horse: Someone died from e cigarette exploding, they are bound to make them illegal now
14:46, 8 Aug - Henry Franks: laaame I love my ecig
14:46, 8 Aug - Teegan: A few people have set on fire already
14:47, 8 Aug - Teegan: I imagine it will be hard to stop people ordering them from China,  which is where they all seem to come from anyway
14:47, 8 Aug - Henry Franks: tbh mine gets really sodding hot im not surprised theyre combusting
14:48, 8 Aug - Angela: Technically he was killed by his oxygen tank exploding
14:48, 8 Aug - Angela: Set off by the eecigarette
14:48, 8 Aug - Teegan: Was he under water?
14:48, 8 Aug - Angela: So you're probably ok unless you're carting one of those around, in which case you're not that ok to begin with
14:48, 8 Aug - Shaggy Crazy Horse: That's circumstantial, e cigarettes are the real #terrorists here
14:49, 8 Aug - Angela: I'm guessing he had some kind of smoking related illness - how ironic
14:50, 8 Aug - Shaggy Crazy Horse: To have lung cancer and die from explosion?
14:50, 8 Aug - Shaggy Crazy Horse: At least he can laugh in the face of cancer
14:51, 8 Aug - Henry Franks: id rather die explosively than cancerously tbh
14:51, 8 Aug - Shaggy Crazy Horse: That's ambiguous. Explosive diarrhoea is not a nice way to go
14:53, 8 Aug - Henry Franks: depends just how explosive surely. I mean, if your digestive system straight up vaporises you it wouldnt be too bad
14:53, 8 Aug - Angela: It'd be bad for whoever finds you
14:54, 8 Aug - Angela: Vaporised by poo
15:16, 8 Aug - Teegan: Ye gods
15:16, 8 Aug - Teegan: Is it possible?
15:46, 8 Aug - Shaggy Crazy Horse: Yup, lookup pooverization
15:47, 8 Aug - Shaggy Crazy Horse: In fact this is where the word poverty is desired from, literally meaning bathing in own shit
15:49, 8 Aug - Henry Franks: haha pooverisation love it
15:49, 8 Aug - Henry Franks: not to be confused with hooverisation, wherein the victim is slowly pulled inside a dyson
15:55, 8 Aug - Shaggy Crazy Horse: If anyone is interested in etymology, the term was invented by dyson on Hoover dam, and has nothing to do with hoovers, which are not powerful enough for that particular form of homicide
15:55, 8 Aug - Teegan: Or shoeverisation, where the victim is beaten to death with his own shoes...
15:55, 8 Aug - Teegan: Good Fridaying, everyone x
16:03, 8 Aug - Bunn: I just misprinted 80 sheets of paper
16:03, 8 Aug - Mike: Lol
16:03, 8 Aug - Mike: Poo
16:03, 8 Aug - Bunn: Time for te pub methinks

16:36, 19 Aug - Teegan: Tee hee hee
16:46, 19 Aug - Shaggy Crazy Horse: BillY Wang

19:32, 19 Aug - Owen James: I teach a kid called dong hung. I bet he doesn't get picked on because he can always use the "dong hung by name dong hung by nature" comeback.

18:49, 1 Sep - Shaggy Crazy Horse: If you like turkish cuisine I strongly recommend tas, it's pretty cheap and mighty tasty. If you want tapas then brindisa is really good, it's moderately priced. If you want a more pub-like atmosphere the George has excellent chefs too
19:41, 1 Sep - Lora Staffenschloten: Brindisa is expensive and always too crowded, long wait. I always love me a good vapiano!
22:58, 1 Sep - Bongo: I thought you said it was Friday henners, or is that something else

20:40, 5 Sep - Owen James: I believe bongo was relaying the information that a fine gangsta named shorty is able to fire a shot gun proficiently but only if he is in less affluent neighbourhoods.
20:41, 5 Sep - ‚Ä™+44 7545 989149‚Ä¨: (After the 'incident')

I live in a forest
Eating bugs makes my day
Detroit what'd ya say?
21:26, 5 Sep - Owen James: I pull out my gat
And with a ratatat tat
Five slugs in your belly
Makes tupac jelly.
21:30, 5 Sep - Owen James: When I left compton town
The crime rate went down
Like sam's mom on peter kay
Thats g life; O-K?
21:30, 5 Sep - Shaggy Crazy Horse: Not bad
21:31, 5 Sep - Shaggy Crazy Horse: For a five year old dive dwelling chive favouring slum child

21:32, 5 Sep - Teegan: Nice rhymes, o
21:33, 5 Sep - Teegan: Where did V go?
21:37, 5 Sep - Owen James: Let's have a word for Mike swarbrick.
He wears the badge of a law dick.
Takes names: 'your nicked'
His mom takes the dicks of four tricks!
21:39, 5 Sep - Teegan: Niiiiiice intro
21:48, 5 Sep - Owen James: Whatup tegan palmer
Voice like a farmer.
Herder of llama.
Wearer of armour.

Yeah I know, that's not so good.
But it ain't bad for a guy from the hood.
I'll stop and continue you should.
While I pause and eat my pud.
21:52, 5 Sep - ‚Ä™+44 7545 989149‚Ä¨: O, your rhymes are so reckless,
We'll show you up as a ludicrous,
feckless, slow loris.
Less ability than Boris...
Johnson at rapping,
caught you napping, prattling
about other's mothers,
but yours ain't getting no thinner,
Time to shut up and eat your dinner.
21:53, 5 Sep - Shaggy Crazy Horse: I like your rhymes but they're not quite mature, think for a bit and then when you're sure hit back, with rhyme that ain't whack, rhyme that will make me take smack, rhyme that will me take crack, crack my back, whack the smack and all that, sure
21:53, 5 Sep - Owen James: Reckless and ludicrous rhyme in no way at all.

Other than that.  It was pretty good.
21:55, 5 Sep - Shaggy Crazy Horse: Dan your rhymes rule, you've studied the school of cool, they literally make drool. You ain't no fool! Like poor O
22:04, 5 Sep - ‚Ä™+44 7545 989149‚Ä¨: I don't need no rhyming dictionary using critic,
The links and perfect timing, work when I just hit it.
If you read the flow like my man Shaggage
You'll find no space for baggage:
Ludicrous, said like the rapper, entrepreneur and actor
rhymes with reckless and is a determining factor,
In your freestyling downfall,
Your mind is so small,
I await your next reply, so
Alex Trofymenko,
Can just show
How its done yo.
22:04, 5 Sep - ‚Ä™+44 7545 989149‚Ä¨: Or alternatively teegz

12:44, 6 Sep - Mike: Ah downer

12:57, 12 Sep - Mike: TIL: George Foreman has 5 sons called George, George, George, George and George
12:57, 12 Sep - Mike: And a daughter called Georgetta
13:00, 12 Sep - Slam: That's nuts
13:00, 12 Sep - Slam: And a great Wikipedia read
13:01, 12 Sep - Joe Jarman: Must get confusing at Christmas
13:01, 12 Sep - Joe Jarman: Do they have nicknames
13:02, 12 Sep - Joe Jarman: I bet he just gets them all an updated version of his grill anyway

13:12, 12 Sep - Mike: I like that he turned down Georgia, Georgie, Georgina for Georgetta!
13:12, 12 Sep - Mike: Probly cause they don't keep the George intact
13:13, 12 Sep - Teegan: Roman numerals are always a stately option
13:13, 12 Sep - Slam: Think it's a cultural thing?, or he just really really loves himself?
13:14, 12 Sep - Slam: <Media omitted>

13:16, 12 Sep - Mike: What with the marbles he lost boxing
13:34, 12 Sep - Angela: Maybe he's just passing on his greatest legacy. The name of an amazing piece of kitchenware. Being called george Forman must open a lot of doors in life
13:35, 12 Sep - Mike: His sons should change the name to George Fiveman
13:43, 12 Sep - Slam: Would you rather fight one George Fiveman sized George Foreman, or four George Foreman sized George Fivemans?
13:44, 12 Sep - Mike: That's a question philosophers will be asking for many years to come I imagine Sam

14:18, 12 Sep - p tschismarov: Why is this happening?
14:31, 12 Sep - ‚Ä™+44 7807 744465‚Ä¨: When you start to write names in fb, it tries to auto-tag
14:32, 12 Sep - Joe Jarman: Does grandmaster flash have to be a page they've liked?
14:33, 12 Sep - ‚Ä™+44 7807 744465‚Ä¨: Nah it's just started making any old suggestions closest to what you're writing
14:33, 12 Sep - ‚Ä™+44 7807 744465‚Ä¨: Or perhaps old nana's just love the flashster

19:24, 13 Sep - Teegan: Wellcome is sweet, the exhibition is small, but the permanent exhibition is also worth a look
19:25, 13 Sep - Teegan: In the vacinity of the cider tap aswell, which is a home away from home for a West Country man

20:15, 13 Sep - Teegan: Eric Cantona. 1987
21:46, 13 Sep - Angela: Rocking a Burberry hat too, years ahead of the curve

10:01, 14 Sep - Vanessa "Beast" Matthews: Sorry guys brunch is postponed today
10:33, 14 Sep - Bongo: Lol that looks tasty
10:47, 14 Sep - Adamina Carden: At 6:30 it was amazeballs
10:57, 14 Sep - Teegan: Mmmmm
10:58, 14 Sep - Teegan: Shall we do something else instead of brunch?
11:01, 14 Sep - Joe Jarman: Fry up
14:09, 14 Sep - Teegan: The time for fry ups may have passed
14:09, 14 Sep - Teegan: But if anyone fancies coming round for a beer and a board game you'd be more than welcome
14:32, 14 Sep - Teegan: Or out for a roast later?
14:32, 14 Sep - Teegan: Options
14:34, 14 Sep - Joe Jarman: Flint knapping in stoke Newington is an option
14:52, 14 Sep - ‚Ä™+44 7502 048124‚Ä¨: I was going to head to the old blue last later on, for some jazzy live music. Its free, and round the corner (from me at least)
14:57, 14 Sep - Teegan: Both sound intriguing
14:57, 14 Sep - Teegan: Will you be stripping out the copper as well, Joe?
16:54, 14 Sep - Teegan: (Have since looked up what flint knapping is- looks like fun)
18:24, 14 Sep - Joe Jarman: I know I'm gutted I didn't attend
15:49, 15 Sep - Bunn: <Media omitted>
15:49, 15 Sep - Bunn: <Media omitted>
16:32, 15 Sep - Teegan: Where's the second one from?
16:35, 15 Sep - Bunn: Google extrafabulouscomics

16:55, 15 Sep - Bunn: Yeah back around 6.30ish
16:55, 15 Sep - Bunn: Bring wine
16:55, 15 Sep - Adamina Carden: It's meat-free Monday so if it's a veggie pie then yes
16:56, 15 Sep - Adamina Carden: I got y'all a postcard. Here's a sneak peek
16:56, 15 Sep - Bunn: Afraid it has several types of meat
16:57, 15 Sep - Adamina Carden: <Media omitted>

20:18, 16 Sep - Slam: Even better! He's in the green division, guaranteed promotion
20:28, 16 Sep - Dave Mendez: Don't forget his hats...he hates that they're not all green
20:32, 16 Sep - Adamina Carden: Oh, and his undies
20:33, 16 Sep - Dave Mendez: You always have to turn a serious conversation into something silly don't you...
20:36, 16 Sep - Adamina Carden: I am dead serious. If Bunn doesn't have all green undies then he's not a real man
20:37, 16 Sep - Dave Mendez: Well as long as you're serious! Shame you don't have yellow dye, could get a teenage mutant teenage turtle theme going
20:38, 16 Sep - Mike: Wait, do you mean this?
20:38, 16 Sep - Mike: <Media omitted>

13:52, 17 Sep - Slam: Good comparative religion Bunn
13:53, 17 Sep - Bunn: I remember holi was just after we left india in feb

14:16, 17 Sep - Kritzia: and then she could meet all you beautiful people from the other side of the world ÓÑÜ
15:31, 17 Sep - Slam: Veto, sounds too loud
15:46, 17 Sep - Bongo: Lol
15:47, 17 Sep - Bongo: I'm up for loud Mexican times
15:47, 17 Sep - Bongo: Also up for the colour run
15:48, 17 Sep - Kritzia: She is gorgeous!!! to not say one of the most beautiful people I know! !
15:49, 17 Sep - Kritzia: She is a musical actress so super fun to be around
15:50, 17 Sep - Owen James: Well I don't know  about anyone else but that was a  good sell. I'm in. Let  us all gaze upon this beauty.
15:58, 17 Sep - Kritzia: Hehe he well I'm just saying we should do something fun :)
16:08, 17 Sep - Adamina Carden: ÓÄé

18:58, 17 Sep - Bongo: I might have to take a bus
19:01, 17 Sep - Bunn: Hmm
19:01, 17 Sep - Bunn: Might bail then
19:01, 17 Sep - Bunn: Only wanted a quick one
19:02, 17 Sep - Teegan: Won't be long
19:02, 17 Sep - Teegan: I've had enough of this
19:05, 17 Sep - Bongo: Eta tegs?
19:05, 17 Sep - Bongo: Google says I'll be 15 mins
19:09, 17 Sep - Bunn: Bleh üò©üò§
19:10, 17 Sep - Bongo: Go home then part timer =P
19:11, 17 Sep - Bunn: This guy was bored and finished at 6
19:13, 17 Sep - Bongo: Lol I won't blame you if you leave, I'd rather be water boarded than bored
19:15, 17 Sep - Teegan: 13 minute walk from here
19:26, 17 Sep - Bongo: Just got here if anyone's around
19:27, 17 Sep - Bongo: The pints are on me
19:27, 17 Sep - Bongo: Just like an alcoholic milkybar kid
19:32, 17 Sep - Teegan: I'm outside Bong- let's enjoy this mild evening
19:48, 17 Sep - Bunn: Yeah i went home
19:56, 17 Sep - Slam: Just tubing from Euston, the anchor still aye?
20:21, 17 Sep - Bongo: Aye
22:27, 17 Sep - Teegan: Owen owen owen, what was the pretty building game for phones you talked about, with the building interaction and such?
22:39, 17 Sep - Owen James: ?
22:39, 17 Sep - Teegan: I need a game
22:39, 17 Sep - Teegan: You mentioned you were playing one
22:40, 17 Sep - Teegan: A building game
22:40, 17 Sep - Teegan: Where rabbits interact work blueberries and the like
22:40, 17 Sep - Owen James: Terrestial?
22:40, 17 Sep - Owen James: Ohhhh
22:40, 17 Sep - Owen James: That's not a phone game
22:40, 17 Sep - Owen James: Reus.
22:40, 17 Sep - Teegan: Bum
22:40, 17 Sep - Owen James: It's really good.
22:40, 17 Sep - Teegan: I only need a phone game
22:41, 17 Sep - Owen James: I am learning android to make a phone game with similar ideas.
22:41, 17 Sep - Owen James: What kind of phone game?
22:43, 17 Sep - Teegan: A building game
22:43, 17 Sep - Teegan: With pretty
22:43, 17 Sep - Teegan: All crowd sourced suggestions welcome
22:48, 17 Sep - Slam: Terraria. Best game ever
23:09, 17 Sep - Owen James: There aren't  many good phone  building  games.
23:10, 17 Sep - Slam: Ooh xconstructor
23:10, 17 Sep - Owen James: Tiny tower was pretty addictive but it was one of those stupid wait  4 hours for something to  finish.
23:10, 17 Sep - Slam: Not sure if it's on iPhone, but it's awesome
23:10, 17 Sep - Owen James: X constructor?
23:10, 17 Sep - Owen James: That sounds good. What is it?
23:10, 17 Sep - Slam: I think that's it, where you build railway bridges and trains go over them
23:11, 17 Sep - Slam: But if you build them badly, everyone dies
23:18, 17 Sep - Owen James: Nice
23:34, 17 Sep - Joe Jarman: Hey Owen how good with android are you
23:34, 17 Sep - Joe Jarman: I'm starting a coursesa course in a few days
23:35, 17 Sep - Joe Jarman: Looking for others interested
23:35, 17 Sep - Joe Jarman: Also I've been messing about with unity as well
00:24, 18 Sep - Owen James: I'm about 1/4 of the way through my book. I have got the basics and am now using fragments. It's a pretty neat setup. Very scalable, but that means that you have to do quite a lot for even the simplest app. Fortunately android released a development  kit pre bundled with eclipse which takes away loads of the legwork  that existed when android was first  released. I haven't  looked into unity, mainly because I don't have an apple. What's  it like?
09:01, 18 Sep - Mike: What's the predictions for Scotland vote then?
09:02, 18 Sep - Angela: I think it'll be a no, what do you think?
09:02, 18 Sep - Mike: I reckon no too, morbidly curious to see a yes vote though...
09:02, 18 Sep - Angela: I didn't think I was bothered but actually I would be a bit sad if they voted yes
09:03, 18 Sep - Angela: Like being dumped by someone I completely took for granted all these years
09:03, 18 Sep - Mike: Lol
09:03, 18 Sep - Mike: And all those cyclists. Damn
09:05, 18 Sep - Mike: 55% no, that's my bet
09:06, 18 Sep - Slam: Cyclists?
09:06, 18 Sep - Marth: Reckon 52% no - a bit too close for comfort
09:06, 18 Sep - Slam: I'm not sure I care about the really. The important thing is it sets the stage for Cornish independence, which is way overdue
09:07, 18 Sep - Slam: *result
09:07, 18 Sep - Slam: They actually have their own currency, take that Scotland
09:08, 18 Sep - Mike: Yeah think about all those gold medals we got in the cycling!
09:09, 18 Sep - Mike: I reckon no's are underreporting. I'd be surprised by a yes vote
09:13, 18 Sep - Angela: I agree, I think 55% at least for no
09:18, 18 Sep - Dave Mendez: I think I would be happy either way: excited for an independent Scotland, content to see an island united.
09:20, 18 Sep - Dave Mendez: The underreporting point is true though the polls may not be very reliable. There was a chap from yougov on the radio the other day saying that polls are usually weighted to control for the way they are sampled however this process requires historical data
09:20, 18 Sep - Mike: There's no exit polls! Bullshit, where's the fun in that?
09:20, 18 Sep - Dave Mendez: There isn't any such data for this referendum but the weighting process has been done anyway which can skew the results
09:24, 18 Sep - Joe Jarman: Ungrateful Scots costing us a fortune yes or no, best just to cull the lot of em. Off to collect my dole money ÓêÖ
09:25, 18 Sep - Mike: You know betfair have already paid out on no? Thats pretty cocky...
09:26, 18 Sep - Angela: While they weight the results for sampling, they can't weight them for people lying. All the polls in 1992 predicted a labour win but it turned out that voting conservative was so uncool that people just didn't want to admit to it
09:26, 18 Sep - Dave Mendez: What happens if it's yes? Do they have to return the money?
09:27, 18 Sep - Angela: Probably voting no is seen as boring but actually people do want the safer option?
09:28, 18 Sep - Bunn: I'm for a yes vote
09:28, 18 Sep - Dave Mendez: Maybe, bit I wonder how many people, when in the ballot box, will let the excitement take over and change to yes
09:28, 18 Sep - Bunn: I bet they could have a more progressive country if they cut London loose
09:31, 18 Sep - Bunn: Great Britain is renamed, not-so-great-anymore Britain
09:32, 18 Sep - Kritzia: I think the contrary actually happens in the ballot box a lot of people take the safe option or they change right there!
09:32, 18 Sep - Bunn: Not-as-united as before Kindom
09:33, 18 Sep - Kritzia: I can't wait for this to be over! !! its boring at work all is Scott here there! ! Common
09:43, 18 Sep - Slam: They'll all be deported tomorrow, it'll be a lonely Friday for you!
09:49, 18 Sep - Kritzia: Hehe well if I had a vote I would say yes!!! Let's start a revolution just for the sake of it!!
09:54, 18 Sep - Bunn: Thats the spirit!
09:56, 18 Sep - Dave Mendez: Yay!
09:57, 18 Sep - Adamina Carden: If the Scots leave then soon enough we'll have Wales and the rest of Ireland jumping ship too
09:57, 18 Sep - Adamina Carden: Then well just be "Britain"
09:57, 18 Sep - Bunn: Wales and Ireland dont have any oil
09:59, 18 Sep - Bunn: But i would quite like to see Wales go it alone
09:59, 18 Sep - Bunn: They could export loveliness
10:05, 18 Sep - Mike: Let's have a London referendum! Fuck everyone else!
10:05, 18 Sep - Mike: Except Hatfield
10:07, 18 Sep - Owen James: I hope it is a yes. That would be an awesome experiment.
10:08, 18 Sep - Owen James: One that we can observe but that really doesn't  affect us much.
10:08, 18 Sep - Slam: Whisky prices will go up
10:08, 18 Sep - Slam: It's the only effect on my life I can think of
10:11, 18 Sep - Mike: Gold medals in cycling will plummet
10:11, 18 Sep - Vanessa "Beast" Matthews: England is starting to produce some good whiskey
10:11, 18 Sep - Mike: People keep ignoring the big issues
10:12, 18 Sep - Mike: Do we still get to claim someone from the uk won Wimbledon?
10:12, 18 Sep - Owen James: Will they? That depends on  a lot of factors: Import  and export tax between England and Scotland, whether the new scoring government  decides to subsidise whiskey, EU trade rules.
10:14, 18 Sep - Slam: It won't go down
10:14, 18 Sep - Mike: It also depends on whether we decide to put Hadrian's wall back up
10:14, 18 Sep - Slam: We're only losing Hoy, and without the superior british bikes and training, he'll dwindle to a hollowed has been
10:21, 18 Sep - Bunn: He'll dwindle to a hollowed has been anyway
10:21, 18 Sep - Bunn: Ha!
10:21, 18 Sep - Bunn: Ageing
10:22, 18 Sep - Bunn: I think claiming Andy Murray as our own has been a gigantic push for Scottish independence
10:24, 18 Sep - Owen James: It could go down sam. It is a big industry. Wouldn't be suprised if a Scotland in charge of thier own economy decide to subsidise it loads. That coupled with EU trade laws would mean no export tax to Britain.
10:25, 18 Sep - Owen James: France subsidise thier wine industry considerably.

10:18, 25 Sep - Adamina Carden: Hey c-towners. Where is this cheap racist hairdresser I can go to for a short back and sides
10:19, 25 Sep - Shaggy Crazy Horse: I think you should grow a mullet
10:23, 25 Sep - Adamina Carden: That is an option...
10:49, 25 Sep - Mike: Peter's. He may also be sexist in which case you'll have to pretend to be a guy
10:50, 25 Sep - Mike: He's really crap btw, I just go there out of habit now
10:54, 25 Sep - Adamina Carden: Haha... I do look a bit like a boy
10:54, 25 Sep - Adamina Carden: How can you mess up short back and sides though?
10:56, 25 Sep - Owen James: By doing long back and sides instead.
10:56, 25 Sep - Owen James: Like a monk.
11:01, 25 Sep - Mike: One time he forgot to cut one of the sides, and I had to remind him
11:03, 25 Sep - Adamina Carden: Hahaha

11:39, 25 Sep - Vanessa "Beast" Matthews: Now you can call for an ambulance
11:40, 25 Sep - Owen James: Instructions unclear. Now he has an ambulance stuck under his kneecap.
11:45, 25 Sep - Shaggy Crazy Horse: Get off your phone and help the damn kid
11:45, 25 Sep - Owen James: Instructions unclear. Now my phone is duct taped to his forehead!
12:43, 25 Sep - Bongo: Skirt size linked to breast cancer?!
12:44, 25 Sep - Bongo: I've seriously had enough of bbc news
12:48, 25 Sep - Owen James: Wait shorter or longer?
12:49, 25 Sep - Owen James: Shorter skirt size linked to breast cancer - Christian union says.
Long skirt size linked to breast cancer playboy magazine says.
12:49, 25 Sep - Owen James: One might begin to question thier motivations.
12:50, 25 Sep - Teegan: Ha
12:50, 25 Sep - Owen James: Also if it's long skirts that cause breast cancer does that mean we can stop victim blaming when a woman in a short skirt gets raped because she was just trying to protect herself from cancer.
12:51, 25 Sep - Teegan: I think they mean skirt size causes cancer.
12:55, 25 Sep - Owen James: It's like the people who do these studies have never heard of comorbidity.
12:55, 25 Sep - Angela: So if I wear jeans? No cancer?
12:55, 25 Sep - Teegan: Solved!
12:55, 25 Sep - Angela: Wait... Jean skirts though
12:56, 25 Sep - Angela: No jean skirts
12:56, 25 Sep - Dave Mendez: Which way round is the correlation? Should I wear skirts?
12:57, 25 Sep - Teegan: Perhaps you should do a pamphlet
12:57, 25 Sep - Teegan: But not wearing skirts doesn't stop you have a skirt size
12:57, 25 Sep - Teegan: So yes dave
12:57, 25 Sep - Teegan: You should
12:57, 25 Sep - Joe Jarman: Why isn't it bum size linked to breast cancer
12:58, 25 Sep - Owen James: The skirt doesn't even cover the breasts!  How the hell would it cause them to get cancer!
12:58, 25 Sep - Joe Jarman: Although I imagine there is some seriously positive correlation with bum size and boob size
13:00, 25 Sep - Bongo: I reckon we should all just go naked from the waist down to avoid looking stupid
13:02, 25 Sep - Joe Jarman: Naaaah waist up, nobody wants to see that bongo, put it away!
13:04, 25 Sep - Owen James: Wait. So a size 8 is less likely to get cancer than a size 14. Why don't they just say people who are larger are generally less healthy. The skirt thing is irrelevant!!!
13:09, 25 Sep - Vanessa "Beast" Matthews: I'm not sure where they got the correlation of waist size for breast cancer. But there is a definite relation between waist size and heart disease, which is not a cancer
13:09, 25 Sep - Vanessa "Beast" Matthews: I just read the article and it's pretty poorly written
13:48, 25 Sep - Bunn: Pints in the george tonight?
13:56, 25 Sep - Dave Mendez: Doig! Not sure. What's the occasion?
14:13, 25 Sep - Shaggy Crazy Horse: Going to that gig in angel tonight

18:37, 25 Sep - Vanessa "Beast" Matthews: They have kraken so all is good
18:37, 25 Sep - Slam: Try and get an outdoors seat, I want to smoke and drink beer

09:01, 26 Sep - Marth: Montage scene. GO CATE!
09:32, 26 Sep - Owen James: How much is the bonus? If it is more then 300 the rational choice would be to just buy yourself a monkey (or whatever percentage of a monkey is equal to 300).
10:04, 26 Sep - ‚Ä™+44 7754 268447‚Ä¨: Haha. The bonus is 10%. Or five monkies (?) Not sure where this cost of monkey estimate has come from Owen!
10:07, 26 Sep - Adamina Carden: üôäÓàÅüôâÓÑïüôàÓîüüòÜ
11:03, 26 Sep - Owen James: 10% of everything over the bonus limit? Or 10% of all your sales for the month?
12:11, 26 Sep - Adamina Carden: So I just discovered that since 2011 LOL has been formally recognized in the Oxford dictionary

16:50, 28 Sep - Bongo: What's the BBQ situation like?
16:54, 28 Sep - Slam: We're through round 1, having meat naps currently
16:54, 28 Sep - Slam: Addy's left us some homemade burgers if you fancy one
16:57, 28 Sep - Teegan: Sorry to miss this momentous occasion
16:57, 28 Sep - Teegan: Needs to be a Sunday of penitence though
16:57, 28 Sep - Slam: You were in our hearts
16:58, 28 Sep - Slam: What happened?
16:58, 28 Sep - Teegan: My parents were staying
16:59, 28 Sep - Teegan: Feel like if we can't get through a weekend of moderation with them then I'm pretty much genetically screwed
16:59, 28 Sep - Teegan: And I will always have to have sunday hangovers
08:34, 29 Sep - Slam: Sorry to do a Hannah guys but...
08:34, 29 Sep - Slam: <Media omitted>

09:54, 29 Sep - Bunn: To youtube!
10:28, 29 Sep - Owen James: Your like Ron Swanson sam.
10:28, 29 Sep - Owen James: You're*
10:49, 29 Sep - Adamina Carden: So it's almost October. Anyone keen to arrange a trip to Thorpe Park Fright Nights
10:51, 29 Sep - Kritzia: Sam!!!! He loves the rollercoasters ;)
10:51, 29 Sep - Kritzia: And me!! I haven't been in a park for ages!  I always faint though
11:04, 29 Sep - Slam: I've never been on a roller coaster, feels a little strange to make it to 28 and then pop my cherry
11:06, 29 Sep - Dave Mendez: It'll be even stranger of you make it to 29
11:06, 29 Sep - Dave Mendez: if
11:08, 29 Sep - Adamina Carden: Haha true. Even numbers are best
12:28, 29 Sep - Bunn: Ive never been on one of those massive ones either
12:29, 29 Sep - Shaggy Crazy Horse: That's what she said
12:32, 29 Sep - Bunn: <Media omitted>
12:36, 29 Sep - Owen James: Sam. My pension counts as an untaxed allowance correct?
12:37, 29 Sep - Owen James: So my taxable income is my income minus my pension.
12:37, 29 Sep - Owen James: And minus NI?
12:40, 29 Sep - Owen James: Wait. The ¬£10,000 limit before you start having to pay tax counts as an allowance.
12:41, 29 Sep - Owen James: ?
12:41, 29 Sep - Owen James: Be on lunch break already. I want answers!!
12:44, 29 Sep - Owen James: Never mind. I figured it out.
12:45, 29 Sep - Owen James: By the way. If you earn less than 41k then tax on dividends is only 10% compared to the 20% on regular savings. If you earn more than that then dividend tax is 32.5%
12:46, 29 Sep - Mike: Banter
12:47, 29 Sep - Owen James: Lel
12:47, 29 Sep - Owen James: What I just said was wrong anyway.
12:47, 29 Sep - Owen James: There is a 10% tax credit.
12:48, 29 Sep - Owen James: So if you earn below 41k you pay no tax on dividends.
12:48, 29 Sep - Owen James: And 22.5% if you earn more than 41k.
12:48, 29 Sep - Shaggy Crazy Horse: Yawn
12:49, 29 Sep - Owen James: Fine. Go invest your money somewhere stupid like up your arse!
12:50, 29 Sep - Shaggy Crazy Horse: I invest my money into beer, and my fund, read stomach, has swollen enough to show that it's a good choice
12:51, 29 Sep - Teegan: Plus investment in liver cirrhosis at this stage negates the need to think about retirement plans
12:52, 29 Sep - Teegan: Morbid, yet simple
12:53, 29 Sep - Owen James: Ok well I'm going to choose companies with a high price to earnings ratio and..... who am I kidding I'll invest in booze as well.
12:54, 29 Sep - Adamina Carden: Woo boozevestment
12:57, 29 Sep - Slam: Great bant-ccountancy Owen, thanks
12:58, 29 Sep - Slam: And the 10% credit means you actually get money back for getting dividend income, it's to encourage poor people to invest in the market, which I find weird on a few levels
12:59, 29 Sep - Adamina Carden: In other news. I just watched three episodes of parks and rec back to back
12:59, 29 Sep - Bunn: Get a job
13:00, 29 Sep - Adamina Carden: I have a job. It's called couch tuner
13:01, 29 Sep - Bunn: Haha. Aw man i wish i was watching parks and rec!
13:03, 29 Sep - Adamina Carden: You could be. If you quit. He he he
13:04, 29 Sep - Adamina Carden: True fact: addiction to parks and rec us the heading cause of unemployment
13:05, 29 Sep - Teegan: Neither true, nor a fact. But 'true fact' is a truism.
13:05, 29 Sep - Teegan: So there's that
13:06, 29 Sep - Teegan: Man, I'm in a monday mood. Sigh.
13:07, 29 Sep - Bunn: I just ate a lovely Gulash from EAT
13:07, 29 Sep - Bunn: That helped
13:07, 29 Sep - Teegan: I decided to try itsu again. Bad decision.
13:07, 29 Sep - Teegan: That shit is nasty.
13:10, 29 Sep - Kritzia: Hahahaha !   I'm in I won't work again mood, so I'll participate in any sort of conversa!!! it's been a very very slow day :$
13:16, 29 Sep - ‚Ä™+44 7502 048124‚Ä¨: I leave my job tomorrow. So anything I do badly today is someone else's problem. Comforting. And in no way motivating.
13:17, 29 Sep - Kritzia: ÓåíÓåíÓåí congrats! !!
13:37, 29 Sep - Teegan: Party cones!
14:45, 29 Sep - Slam: I love itsu! The rare salmon steak is one of my all time favorite work lunches
15:14, 29 Sep - Teegan: They leave a lot to be desired in the world of noodle soups
15:15, 29 Sep - Teegan: Tomato soup isn't Japanese!
15:15, 29 Sep - Teegan: They have taken 'fusion' to a terrible place
15:23, 29 Sep - ‚Ä™+44 7807 744465‚Ä¨: Soup is poor but their sushi is the top
15:27, 29 Sep - Teegan: They also don't do any veg sushi really
15:27, 29 Sep - Teegan: Which makes wasabi my lunchtime fave
15:33, 29 Sep - Angela: Itsu used to have some really nice veggie potsu but they have got rid of them and replaced them with chicken and duck. I was mighty disappointed and now all their veggie food sucks
15:34, 29 Sep - Angela: Apart from "selected stores", lucky bastards.
15:35, 29 Sep - Angela: Best veggie sushi is crushh. Crussh?
15:35, 29 Sep - Angela: It all looks wrong!

16:03, 30 Sep - Angela: I don't even know how to express how that comment made me feel
16:03, 30 Sep - Angela: A cross between amusement and horror
16:04, 30 Sep - Angela: üôÄüòøüòπ

13:06, 20 Oct - Adamina Carden: Hahaha. Agreed with Bunn. It's an awful link... It may lead to sweet delicious Marilyn, but the link itself Óêá
13:06, 20 Oct - ‚Ä™+44 7502 048124‚Ä¨: Doesn't really help your argument
13:46, 20 Oct - Adamina Carden: Hey kids, so erryone who wants to come Saturday the place is booked at 1:45 so I suggest meeting at Uxbridge station at 12:30 in full kigu if possible. We cab either get a public transport bus which takes Ca. 20-30 min, or I book a taxi for fifteen purple or so (Phil kinda knows wagwan just not specifics)... Also if you've no idea what I'm on about message me directly.
14:42, 20 Oct - Marth: You can probably take a bike on the train since its a weekend, so I'll probably do that, any other takers?
14:51, 20 Oct - Shaggy Crazy Horse: Sounds like a good idea
14:53, 20 Oct - Adamina Carden: Hmmm yea bike actually would be cool
16:36, 20 Oct - Mike: You can't cycle from Canning town to Uxbridge
16:36, 20 Oct - Mike: Well I mean, you can, but it will take like 2 hours
16:37, 20 Oct - Bunn: Bike on train
16:38, 20 Oct - Bunn: Then cycle the rest once train reaches station
16:42, 20 Oct - Mike: What train?
16:43, 20 Oct - Adamina Carden: Metropolitan
16:43, 20 Oct - Joe Jarman: That's not a train
16:43, 20 Oct - Joe Jarman: Ie no bike
16:44, 20 Oct - Slam: You can do it from anywhere it goes overground, so cycle to baker street or something
16:44, 20 Oct - Slam: Not the dlr though, I got stung like that once
16:45, 20 Oct - Bunn: Yeah i was thinking cycle to west london first
16:45, 20 Oct - Bunn: All sounds like quite a lot of effort tbh!
16:45, 20 Oct - Mike: You guys are keen!
16:46, 20 Oct - Mike: I am not gonna risk getting drunk afterwards
16:46, 20 Oct - Joe Jarman: 3.5 mile cycle from slough train station

17:25, 20 Oct - Marth: Good shout, thanks doc!
17:27, 20 Oct - Joe Jarman: Sounds expensive, what's the difference between that and uxbridge oyster business?
17:42, 20 Oct - Adamina Carden: I reation cheaper to oyster to Uxbridge
17:44, 20 Oct - Dave Mendez: Its 3 quid off peak to Uxbridge from zone 1, unless its changes since march

30 Oct 2014 12:13 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: What the fuck did you just fucking say about me, you little bitch? I‚Äôll have you know I graduated top of my class in the Navy Seals, and I‚Äôve been involved in numerous secret raids on Al-Quaeda, and I have over 300 confirmed kills. I am trained in gorilla warfare and I‚Äôm the top sniper in the entire US armed forces. You are nothing to me but just another target. I will wipe you the fuck out with precision the likes of which has never been seen before on this Earth, mark my fucking words. You think you can get away with saying that shit to me over the Internet? Think again, fucker. As we speak I am contacting my secret network of spies across the¬†USAand your IP is being traced right now so you better prepare for the storm, maggot. The storm that wipes out the pathetic little thing you call your life. You‚Äôre fucking dead, kid. I can be anywhere, anytime, and I can kill you in over seven hundred ways, and that‚Äôs just with my bare hands. Not only am I extensively trained in unarmed combat, but I have access to the entire arsenal of the United States Marine Corps and I will use it to its full extent to wipe your miserable ass off the face of the continent, you little shit. If only you could have known what unholy retribution your little ‚Äúclever‚Äù comment was about to bring down upon you, maybe you would have held your fucking tongue. But you couldn‚Äôt, you didn‚Äôt, and now you‚Äôre paying the price, you goddamn idiot. I will shit fury all over you and you will drown in it. You‚Äôre fucking dead, kiddo.

4 Nov 2014 12:09 - Joe Jarman: Failing that, ben thanh market
4 Nov 2014 12:09 - Adimina: Haha
4 Nov 2014 12:56 - Owen: For a while i was trying to understand that as some racist joke. "Are black people often homeless or something?!"

Then i 2014 realised you meant the camping shop.
4 Nov 2014 12:59 - Owen: Maybe they are avid campers. Thats not a sterotype I have heard though.
4 Nov 2014 13:05 - Adimina: Racist Owen
4 Nov 2014 13:08 - Joe Jarman: Black people hate camping, thus more.likely to give up sleeping bags?! Óêâ

4 Nov 2014 17:08 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: 4 MORE YEARS! 4 MORE YEARS!
4 Nov 2014 19:01 - Lorna: Maybe you could afford a deposit and buy the house if you all club together...
4 Nov 2014 19:04 - Owen: You clearly haven't seen how much money that house spends on beer lorna üòÉ
4 Nov 2014 19:05 - Owen: They could probably get the deposit by saving up a week's worth of empties and selling the aluminum.
4 Nov 2014 19:11 - Bongo: Yea but then the cleaner wouldn't have anything to pick up
4 Nov 2014 19:26 - Sam Roberts: Can't believe she's lasted so long
4 Nov 2014 19:26 - Sam Roberts: Even through bin-gate, and this Saturday's binge fest
4 Nov 2014 19:28 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: Didn't the landlord get it for like 50k?
4 Nov 2014 21:26 - Sam Roberts: ¬£50 and a bag full of nails
4 Nov 2014 21:55 - Bongo: Lol bin-gate
4 Nov 2014 21:57 - Bongo: Some witch was like "have this house on yonder but beware! mould grows everywhere, ye shall be plagued by rats and forever there will be the foulest stench enflicted upon man"
4 Nov 2014 21:57 - Bongo: But lucky for him he found you guys
4 Nov 2014 22:13 - Owen: I think the foul stench will clear itself right up when phil goes abroad for a bit.
4 Nov 2014 22:21 - Sam Roberts: That's the only thing keeping the mould at bay

5 Nov 2014 12:57 - Owen: A conversation i just overheard between two kids: "do you think scorpion from mortal kombat could overcome the combined might of the chaos gods on battle?"... I teach such nerds!
5 Nov 2014 12:57 - Owen: They are literally like comic book guy from the simpsons.
5 Nov 2014 12:59 - Sam Roberts: .... well could he?
5 Nov 2014 13:01 - Adimina: <Media omitted>
5 Nov 2014 13:01 - Adimina: Look who's come to say hello
5 Nov 2014 13:03 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: Scorpion ain't all that
5 Nov 2014 13:33 - Phil: Shut your dirty mouth mike you sub human sub zero fanboy. Obviously scorpion can't battle all the chaos gods but he'd do better than pretty much anyone else.
5 Nov 2014 14:07 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: People just like scorpion cause of the stupid sob story. He's like those contestants on X factor who are on there cause their dad died even though everyone knows they won't win
5 Nov 2014 14:14 - Alex Bunn: üëèüëè
5 Nov 2014 14:29 - Phil: The sob story came later when the drooling masses couldn't handle that a bad ass ninja had no back story beyond being a bad ass ninja.
5 Nov 2014 14:48 - Shaggy: Yellow is a pretty awesome colour
5 Nov 2014 14:50 - Owen: Scorpion is a pretty awesome animal.
5 Nov 2014 15:26 - Dave: Skulls are cool
5 Nov 2014 15:43 - Shaggy: And so is fire
5 Nov 2014 16:00 - Phil: Also, harpoons.
5 Nov 2014 16:13 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: These are dumb arguments
5 Nov 2014 16:16 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: He's a cheap-ass teleporting bitch
5 Nov 2014 16:19 - Phil: Someone got his ass beat by scorpion to many times. He was just the vessel man.

9 Nov 2014 20:14 - Martha: Yes. Have to buy them in advance since it usually sells out. There may not be many left next to each other though. Would people prefer to be loners sitting on their own or should we go for Tuesday?
9 Nov 2014 20:15 - Sam Roberts: I'm totally climbing Tuesday, well in for tomorrow though
9 Nov 2014 20:15 - Sam Roberts: Can we see how next to each other we are? Pairs would be ok

9 Nov 2014 21:07 - Sam Roberts: The horde, always
9 Nov 2014 21:08 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: I prefer Tues at the Barbican

11 Nov 2014 09:42 - Dave: Can you imagine?
11 Nov 2014 10:48 - Sam Roberts: Thought it was a super racist headline in first glance, I'm much happier at the thought of ninja terrorist Mike
11 Nov 2014 12:46 - Phil: I think that is the closest anyone can reasonably come to being called a teenage mutant ninja turtle by a newspaper. Congrats mike.

11 Nov 2014 19:49 - Shaggy: Yus
11 Nov 2014 19:51 - Lorna: I'm super close
11 Nov 2014 20:12 - Shaggy: We're in the barbican centre, need to go to level -2
12 Nov 2014 10:33 - Alex Bunn: I think interstellar is worth a second watch
12 Nov 2014 10:33 - Alex Bunn: With lowered expectations
12 Nov 2014 10:33 - Alex Bunn: There was a lot to be appreciated in that film
12 Nov 2014 10:33 - Alex Bunn: But there was also a lot that was lame
12 Nov 2014 10:34 - Owen: Phil needs to see it again definitely. Because he spent half the film in the loo
12 Nov 2014 10:34 - Alex Bunn: Shit. Probably not worth a convo here cos theres peeps that havnt seen it
12 Nov 2014 10:34 - Henry Dranks: I absolutely loved it. beautiful homage to some of my fav scifi
12 Nov 2014 10:34 - Sam Roberts: It's weird, I really enjoyed maybe 9/10 of it, but felt cheated by the end
12 Nov 2014 10:34 - Owen: The last 15 minutes just shouldn't have been in the film
12 Nov 2014 10:35 - Tegan: Lots of Sci Fi films s have that quality though
12 Nov 2014 10:36 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: Yeah like Source Code
12 Nov 2014 10:37 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: Interstellar was pretty daft, can't say I wasn't entertained though
12 Nov 2014 10:37 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: Low marks for the Barbican cinema though
12 Nov 2014 10:37 - Shaggy: I think Matthew mcconaghey had a speech impediment, did he have a stroke?
12 Nov 2014 10:37 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: I think its more that the sound was shit
12 Nov 2014 10:38 - Owen: Yeah barbican cinema was rubbish
12 Nov 2014 10:38 - Owen: Barbican't  more like! Amiright?!
12 Nov 2014 10:38 - Alex Bunn: Yeah i think we might have had a better experience somewhere else
12 Nov 2014 10:38 - Alex Bunn: My fave was the sarcastic robot
12 Nov 2014 10:38 - Shaggy: IMAX
12 Nov 2014 10:49 - Martha: Meh, I agree the screen was pretty weeny, but it was nice to go somewhere close to me for once. Thank you folks for coming to my neck of the woods! That wins you 3 times I don't complain about going east :)
12 Nov 2014 10:49 - Martha: Sarcastic robot wins it.
12 Nov 2014 10:50 - Owen: Marthican't more like! Amiright folks!?
12 Nov 2014 10:50 - Owen: üêõ
12 Nov 2014 10:51 - Sam Roberts: Could've done with subtitles
12 Nov 2014 10:52 - Martha: I just realised: you know that film 'contact' I said it was quite like? Matthew mcconnorghdkdkd was in that too.
12 Nov 2014 10:52 - Sam Roberts: I liked the barbican centre though, felt like we were running through a Kafka novel to get there
12 Nov 2014 10:52 - Martha: Yes to subtitles, then we might have been able to understand over bun's rustling.
12 Nov 2014 10:54 - Sam Roberts: Hahaha I'd forgotten that! Full points for rustling bunny!
12 Nov 2014 11:30 - Alex Bunn: Shouldve munched during re-entry
12 Nov 2014 11:31 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: Or during one of those organ solos
12 Nov 2014 11:33 - Joe Jarman: Anyone left who hasn't seen it?
12 Nov 2014 11:33 - Joe Jarman: I want to go today üòÑ
12 Nov 2014 12:05 - Phil: I went for one perfectly timed piss. I missed a few minutes of crying and "daddy please don't go".

12 Nov 2014 18:40 - Owen: Which flat are you?

13 Nov 2014 08:09 - Owen: Wow. Isn't it ironic than palindnilap is also a palindnilap.
13 Nov 2014 08:21 - Hannah Murphy: There are 2 types of people in the world. Those who can extrapolate from incomplete data.
13 Nov 2014 08:33 - Owen: And mutant lizard men?

14 Nov 2014 11:14 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: <Media omitted>
14 Nov 2014 11:14 - Tegan: I think Mike also counts each consecutive Newgate from one person as one message
14 Nov 2014 11:15 - Tegan: So you need to be more strategic
14 Nov 2014 11:15 - Tegan: Nice
14 Nov 2014 11:18 - Hannah Murphy: Impish!

14 Nov 2014 11:24 - Owen: OP will deliver....?
14 Nov 2014 11:33 - Sam Roberts: *did. I wonder if text typos are improving humanity's lateral thinking. It's like every fifth message is a little logic puzzle
14 Nov 2014 11:35 - Owen: I was thinking 'disappeared'
14 Nov 2014 11:42 - Dan Sluckin: ...membered 12 people in that incident.
14 Nov 2014 11:45 - Owen: He didn't quit, he was committed to a mental asylum after all that dismembering.

14 Nov 2014 12:18 - Tegan: Exemplary. Did you see mike's last horde analysis?
14 Nov 2014 12:18 - Owen: Sam better be careful because someone likes italians too much.
14 Nov 2014 12:19 - Tegan: (The idea that that is shaggy's problem is more than gently misogynistic)
14 Nov 2014 12:20 - Owen: Dave! Get your woman back in line. She is talking out of turn!
14 Nov 2014 12:22 - Tegan: Looking for an emoji to express my feminist vitriol...

5 Dec 2014 14:12 - Sam Roberts: Haha that took me way too long
5 Dec 2014 14:12 - Sam Roberts: Looks like nothing changed!
5 Dec 2014 14:14 - Martha: Not much to be honest! It looks a bit richer here and there (fancy tv screens, scary automatic video capture in all of the lecture rooms) but it's still a nostalgia bonanza.
5 Dec 2014 14:22 - Tegan: Nice
5 Dec 2014 15:55 - Dave: How did your talk go?
5 Dec 2014 16:00 - Martha: Went well, thanks!!

7 Dec 2014 02:47 - Alex Bunn: It was way coool
7 Dec 2014 02:48 - Alex Bunn: I caught my front wheel in a drain while i did a super cool undertaking manouvre
7 Dec 2014 02:48 - Alex Bunn: And then i had to get the super cool nightbus home

8 Dec 2014 18:22 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: <Media omitted>
8 Dec 2014 19:27 - Vinay: Lol
8 Dec 2014 19:28 - Vinay: I'm up for skating on Wednesday... Hopefully it won't be raining
9 Dec 2014 13:36 - Dave: Would anyone like to take my place kayaking from Limehouse to the Victoria park winter wonderland thing? It clashes with my work Xmas meal. Happy to offer the ticket at a good discount. X
9 Dec 2014 13:46 - Shaggy: Lol you have to pay money to do it?!
9 Dec 2014 14:18 - Joe Jarman: Yeah it sounds pretty brutal kayaking in this weather
9 Dec 2014 14:19 - Tegan: We didn't remember what cold was like when we signed up
9 Dec 2014 14:19 - Tegan: I'm probably going to end up in tears
9 Dec 2014 14:20 - Tegan: Good group though- Petia etc
9 Dec 2014 14:21 - Phil: Is petia a group or a person?
9 Dec 2014 14:22 - Joe Jarman: I like those guys
9 Dec 2014 14:22 - Joe Jarman: Petias not a big joe jarman fan
9 Dec 2014 14:22 - Joe Jarman: I think I consumed something naughty off her macbook

9 Dec 2014 14:23 - Joe Jarman: But I have my work party tomorrow
9 Dec 2014 14:23 - Tegan: Il have stopped crying by then
9 Dec 2014 14:23 - Tegan: Ah well
9 Dec 2014 14:45 - Sam Roberts: Who's organising? Well there be wet suits?
9 Dec 2014 14:47 - Tegan: BYO :(
9 Dec 2014 14:47 - Sam Roberts: Winter wonderland would be an excellent meet up and skate place
9 Dec 2014 14:47 - +44 7944 609055 left
9 Dec 2014 14:52 - Shaggy: I would cut your losses right now and bail, like em just now
9 Dec 2014 14:57 - Sam Roberts: That'd be awesome with a proper suit+ gloves
9 Dec 2014 15:08 - Tegan: Nah,  I'm gon' do it.  Join us after for mulled wine? Is there an ice rink at the Victoria Park winterthingaling?
9 Dec 2014 15:08 - Sam Roberts: I'll give you 40% survival without
9 Dec 2014 15:21 - Alex Bunn: In victoria park yes there is obe
9 Dec 2014 19:30 - Dave: Sam, sounds like you'd like my ticket...
9 Dec 2014 19:33 - Sam Roberts: Gimme a wetsuit and I'm there!
9 Dec 2014 19:34 - Sam Roberts: How much are the tickets?
9 Dec 2014 19:34 - Phil: Surely you can't kayak in this weather without a wetsuit. This is a country where they barely trust people near ankle deep water without a 2m railing and some barbed wire
9 Dec 2014 19:36 - Dave: I'm loathed to say how much the tickets were but for you, ¬£15.
9 Dec 2014 19:41 - Tegan: Brown wooded butttocks

9 Dec 2014 19:49 - Sam Roberts: That all worked out nicely! Need anything from the shop Phil?
9 Dec 2014 19:50 - Phil: Depends if you want stir fry. If yes, read house bants.
9 Dec 2014 20:21 - Tegan: Hope I didn't put you out of your way with my Wolf boy beer cry
9 Dec 2014 20:24 - Sam Roberts: Made me leave the office as it happens, I'm cook with that woolfie

10 Dec 2014 12:12 - Sam Roberts: Victoria park for winter wonderland + seeing if Teeg survives
10 Dec 2014 12:13 - Sam Roberts: The guys can skate and the ladies can drink mulled wine and watch
10 Dec 2014 13:29 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: Apparently we're going to WW after the office Xmas party on Friday
10 Dec 2014 13:30 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: What could go wrong
10 Dec 2014 13:31 - Shaggy: What's that?

10 Dec 2014 13:54 - Dave: Looks like I'm gonna be kayaking too. The more warm hugs the better at vikkie park
10 Dec 2014 16:38 - Sam Roberts: Sooo I've got a heap still to do, looks like I might be stuck here for the night :(
10 Dec 2014 16:39 - Sam Roberts: You got to love having a nice relaxing morning , then finding a shitstorm when you get back
10 Dec 2014 16:52 - Owen: What time and where are people going to be?

10 Dec 2014 18:10 - Alex Bunn: Pub in London Bridge?
10 Dec 2014 18:12 - Sam Roberts: No word from teeg and Dave, I think they've succumbed to hypothermia already
10 Dec 2014 18:12 - Sam Roberts: I'm going to be stuck here couple of hours at least, might come join if you're out though
10 Dec 2014 18:13 - Alex Bunn: Thats what i was hoping for. Need to organise something due to my lack of phone network and dependency on wifi
10 Dec 2014 18:14 - Alex Bunn: Phil if we decide will you come?
10 Dec 2014 18:24 - Alex Bunn: Ok i'm going home
10 Dec 2014 18:24 - Alex Bunn: Bye

10 Dec 2014 18:30 - Phil: üêí

10 Dec 2014 22:30 - Tegan: Yup, kayaking is also pretty toasty it turns out :)

11 Dec 2014 16:12 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: Rice + laxative?
11 Dec 2014 16:13 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: Favourite business terms at qubit seem to be 'deep-dive (into)' and 'verticals'
11 Dec 2014 16:16 - Phil: Urban dictionary word of the day: a crapella
11 Dec 2014 16:30 - Tegan: We're always deep diving into verticals
11 Dec 2014 16:30 - Tegan: Do you do much silo-ing?
11 Dec 2014 17:43 - Bongo: My favourite business term is haircut
11 Dec 2014 17:43 - Bongo: Although it's only a financial one

14 Dec 2014 11:20 - Owen: Why was she removed instead of leaving? Bit rude, no?
14 Dec 2014 11:20 - Alex Bunn: Pipe down

28 Dec 2014 22:06 - Phil left
28 Dec 2014 22:07 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: <Media omitted>
28 Dec 2014 22:07 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: NOOOO
28 Dec 2014 23:10 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: Well, I for one am shocked, saddened, and quite drunk by the lack of uproar at this loss.  People leave this group all the time. Usually if I have any reaction at all, it's a positive one. Good riddance says I, for a herd of buffulo can only move as fast as its slowest, and least comical member.  But tonight, we have lost a true The Horde titan. He never contributed a lot, but everything he did was hilariously accurate, terse, and withering in execution. He will be sorely missed.
28 Dec 2014 23:10 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: <Media omitted>

29 Dec 2014 16:26 - Joe Jarman: Alternatively the guest looks pretty sweet
29 Dec 2014 16:34 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: Viable options are Hobbit, Big Eyes, or if you want to come to West End we can try and catch a preview of Birdman

29 Dec 2014 18:14 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: Deal.
29 Dec 2014 18:33 - Owen: That explains why the beer would be better.
29 Dec 2014 18:37 - Sam Roberts: The other Brown's
29 Dec 2014 18:45 - Owen: I like how bongo knows all the strip clubs.

6 Jan 16:39 - Alex Bunn: Wtf is that movie?
6 Jan 16:40 - Owen: Maybe. However i can imagine the film being about motor neuron disease instead of black hole mathematics like it should be!
6 Jan 16:42 - Joe Jarman: Can't ya just come round and make pie already
6 Jan 16:46 - Tegan: I think it's mainly about stevesy. With some black hole mathematics.
6 Jan 16:46 - Tegan: It is named erroneously
6 Jan 16:46 - Tegan: S' meant to be aiight though
6 Jan 16:47 - Tegan: No pie

7 Jan 08:44 - Sam Roberts: We're going tonight... Friday drinks to break it down?
7 Jan 09:19 - Joe Jarman: Aww my god, that was the most racist haircut ever

7 Jan 09:26 - Joe Jarman: Peter's hairdresser at the end of our road
7 Jan 09:36 - Tegan: I don't know if you guys should be financially spring racists
7 Jan 09:36 - Tegan: Supporting
7 Jan 09:36 - Tegan: Do you have to ask him race related questions to hear it,  or does the hate just come pouring out?
7 Jan 09:37 - Owen: "So what kind of negro haircut do you want today. Also i think the pakis shouldn't be allowed the vote."
7 Jan 09:37 - Owen: That kind of racist?
7 Jan 09:58 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: In my experience, most of his hate is at eastern Europeans
7 Jan 09:58 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: And immigrants in general
7 Jan 09:58 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: Which is weird because he's Italian
7 Jan 10:01 - Owen: Well all those poles come over here and eat our pasta.
7 Jan 10:15 - Joe Jarman: He is italian
7 Jan 10:16 - Joe Jarman: But he was here before we were even born apparently
7 Jan 10:16 - Joe Jarman: Which is amazing coz his english is really poor

7 Jan 12:00 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: We went there last time, how about the spoons?
7 Jan 12:03 - Owen: Wherever we go I will sit in a corner crying about the lack of booze.
7 Jan 12:03 - Owen: Can i smell your beer please mike?
7 Jan 12:06 - Tegan: Mike's on the white wine
7 Jan 12:06 - Tegan: Spritzeritzeritzers

7 Jan 12:13 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: My Dad, I got one

7 Jan 12:50 - Owen: Eliza is with ee. I think they do it as well.
7 Jan 12:53 - Lorna: Same thing, ee is a merge of orange and t mobile. Maybe t mobile wear the trousers which is why orange Wednesdays is finishing

7 Jan 14:12 - Alex Bunn: <Media omitted>

7 Jan 14:17 - Shaggy: I don't get it. Is that a deliberate misspelling?
7 Jan 14:18 - Alex Bunn: Itchy and scrathy land episode. Do your homework
7 Jan 14:18 - Alex Bunn: I'm disappointed
7 Jan 14:20 - Tegan: The gag is weakened by the fact that you can get a bart mug right next to it
7 Jan 14:20 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: omg Shaggy, like seriously

7 Jan 15:03 - Tegan: I'm sitting next to some people in a cafe who are talking about embezzling money in the Seychelles
7 Jan 15:03 - Tegan: Who do I call? ?
7 Jan 15:09 - Alex Bunn: Infiltrate their circle of trust
7 Jan 15:14 - Tegan: Probable false alarm.  I think they're just idiots.
7 Jan 15:14 - Tegan: Probably rich idiots.
7 Jan 15:22 - Shaggy: She sells Seychelles
7 Jan 15:27 - Tegan: But where?
7 Jan 15:31 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: On the East African real estate market
7 Jan 15:46 - Owen: Tell them you can help them. Then steal all thier money. Stealings not wrong if you do it to rich idiots... like Kevin Bacon

7 Jan 16:04 - Tegan: Wisdom
7 Jan 16:38 - Sam Roberts: Never knew that! Most awesome!
7 Jan 16:38 - Sam Roberts: Just when you thought spoons couldn't get cheaper or more cheerful
7 Jan 16:39 - Sam Roberts: Everyone aiming for 7 then? I might be a touch early
7 Jan 16:41 - Tegan: Early sounds good
7 Jan 16:42 - Tegan: I still can't quite engender what my job is or why it's important
7 Jan 16:42 - Tegan: Remember,  dammit
7 Jan 16:42 - Tegan: This swipe business is getting worse and worse
7 Jan 16:47 - Lorna: I'll be a bit early. Is it 20% off drinks too?
7 Jan 16:55 - Tegan: I dunnoo
7 Jan 16:56 - Dave: Nah, but this is spoons so drinks are reasonable, even on the wharf.
7 Jan 17:03 - Alex Bunn: Cheapskates

19 Jan 21:01 - Owen: Yeah what the hell?! Did you hire your years supply of cleaners all at once?
19 Jan 21:01 - Owen: Or maybe it was shaggy causing all the mess all along.
19 Jan 21:03 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: Man you should see the projector room

22 Jan 14:14 - Sam Roberts: Pretty sure it isn't dude...
22 Jan 14:14 - Sam Roberts: You having that thing where you hear a word for the first time, then it's everywhere all of a sudden?
22 Jan 14:14 - Sam Roberts: I'm sure there'a a conspiracy around that
22 Jan 14:22 - Angela: There's a theory that says when you learn another language, you hear a word regularly without taking it in it for ages, and then one day when your ability gets good enough you suddenly 'notice' it and either understand it through context or you look it up or whatever. Then after that, you notice it every time it's said because you know it's there. Which is spooky if it's also true in English, cos it means you're just deaf to this word for years but it's actually been there all along.......
22 Jan 14:23 - Alex Bunn: Good fact!
22 Jan 14:23 - Sam Roberts: Oh god, have you all being talking about jingoistic braggadocio all this time!? I've been dead to it until now!

24 Jan 10:48 - Shaggy: Life without beer is like beer without alcohol
24 Jan 12:35 - Martha: I have some work but would enjoy a microbrew later

24 Jan 16:03 - Alex Bunn: Gonna cook dinner instead üòã
24 Jan 16:37 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: There's this demented airport up a mountain in courchevel
24 Jan 16:37 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: <Media omitted>
24 Jan 16:37 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: Youtube it, its crazy
24 Jan 17:01 - Lorna: <Media omitted>
24 Jan 17:03 - Alex Bunn: My uncle has flown his plane into that airport
24 Jan 17:05 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: Your uncle is mental
24 Jan 17:22 - Vanessa: How come I've never heard about this uncle
24 Jan 17:23 - Alex Bunn: Well unfortunately he's not with us anymore üòì
24 Jan 17:25 - Shaggy: Heaven is halfpipe
24 Jan 17:30 - Joe Jarman: Hey shagz gonna restart your thing
24 Jan 17:30 - Joe Jarman: Thin it's almost done
24 Jan 17:45 - Shaggy: I thought it was done
24 Jan 18:28 - Sam Roberts: Home brew!
24 Jan 18:29 - Sam Roberts: Hey, don't put it on yet
24 Jan 18:29 - Sam Roberts: We'll be done with this keg in a week, then we can have a brew off
24 Jan 18:29 - Alex Bunn: Hows the micro breweries?
24 Jan 18:29 - Alex Bunn: (Shags and V)
24 Jan 18:37 - Shaggy: Exquisite flavour of hops makes you really question the totalitarian rule of major corporate beer companies enthral lung their rule of blandness on out temporary existence
24 Jan 18:43 - Alex Bunn: And who says beer kills brain cells
24 Jan 20:01 - Tegan: Bastards
24 Jan 20:02 - Vinay: Jon snow
24 Jan 20:12 - Lorna: Too late Sam- beer's a brewin'. But we're gonna bottle it so it'll keep for a brew off.
24 Jan 23:34 - Sam Roberts: It's ON!
24 Jan 23:34 - Sam Roberts: I'm going to find out how to brew for high percentage, make some home brew special brew
25 Jan 01:01 - Lorna: If you brew with 1/10th of the water, then it'll make beer 10 times as strong right?...
25 Jan 01:09 - Sam Roberts: Sounds legit
25 Jan 01:10 - Sam Roberts: Or with 10x the sugar
25 Jan 01:11 - Sam Roberts: I hear the alcohol is just a calculation on the sugar
25 Jan 05:47 - Shaggy: Really? Sweet
25 Jan 09:15 - Owen: Alcohol content is sugar and yeast strain. Beer yeast will die at a lower abv than wine yeast.
25 Jan 10:09 - Lorna: So... Add wine yeast instead! This syrupy, sweet wine special brew will definitely give you the shits. üí©
25 Jan 12:21 - Dave: Mix in a load of vodka too.
25 Jan 12:21 - Dave: (Pro tip)
25 Jan 15:45 - Sam Roberts: Enjoying all of these, keep them coming
25 Jan 15:45 - Sam Roberts: Combined, I should be able to get beer over 30%
25 Jan 15:45 - Sam Roberts: I shall call it Tombstone
25 Jan 15:46 - Shaggy: You can freeze it and separate alcohol, there's one you can get in brewdog that's 52%
25 Jan 15:48 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: I think at some point you can't call it beer anymore haha
25 Jan 15:48 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: Sorites pissed paradox
27 Jan 07:31 - Tegan: Whiplash tonight at the wharf?
27 Jan 07:42 - Lorna: Yes to whiplash. Can I suggest a more central cinema?
27 Jan 07:47 - Tegan: We'll probably wharf as Dave has to work late
27 Jan 07:47 - Tegan: If he finishes wallet we could maybe get elsewhere
27 Jan 07:47 - Tegan: Had to be a cineworld for half price Tuesday
27 Jan 08:01 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: Down for whiplash,
27 Jan 08:02 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: Wherever, as long as you decide by like 6
27 Jan 12:11 - Lorna: Tuesday deal is good. Were you thinking 6:10 or 8:50 for the film?
27 Jan 13:16 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: Will have to be 8.50 for me
27 Jan 14:11 - Tegan: 8.50 sounds aiight
27 Jan 18:06 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: What time to meet?
27 Jan 18:16 - Hannah Murphy: <Media omitted>
27 Jan 18:16 - Hannah Murphy: <Media omitted>
27 Jan 18:20 - Hannah Murphy: I'm guessing number 16 bus shelter may be referring to a place of conception?
27 Jan 18:20 - Lorna: I'm bailing on the cinema guys
27 Jan 18:23 - Alex Bunn: Lol that bus stop kid is a born winner!
27 Jan 18:41 - Vanessa: I was told that in Germany you have to ask permission on the name you want to give your child
27 Jan 18:42 - Tegan: Mike, are you still up for the wharf?
27 Jan 18:47 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: Sure

27 Jan 21:05 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: <Media omitted>

27 Jan 23:26 - Owen: Good then.
27 Jan 23:26 - Owen: ?
27 Jan 23:37 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: Well I don't want to overhype it
27 Jan 23:37 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: But I have already, so yeah its amazing, see it at the cinema
27 Jan 23:41 - Tegan: Hype hype hype!
27 Jan 23:41 - Tegan: Made me angry
27 Jan 23:41 - Tegan: But was good
27 Jan 23:43 - Dave: Was pretty great. Visceral, exhausting cinema. In a good way.
28 Jan 06:42 - Angela: Why did it make you angry teegs?
28 Jan 07:41 - Tegan: Either because it celebrated a sad cycle of dependency, or because I'll never be that good at anything
28 Jan 07:41 - Tegan: Probably the latter
28 Jan 07:49 - Angela: Getting old to the point where that becomes apparent is rubbish! No longer do I have potential üò¢
28 Jan 07:49 - Angela: I had so much potential!
28 Jan 07:51 - Sam Roberts: I've switched from aiming at rock climbing legend to sexy pensioner
28 Jan 07:56 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: I don't agree that it celebrated it Teegs, it was pretty neutral
28 Jan 08:05 - Alex Bunn: Lol Sam
28 Jan 08:06 - Owen: I'll just aim for pensioner
28 Jan 08:18 - Tegan: That's why I did probably the later
28 Jan 08:18 - Tegan: Latter
28 Jan 08:19 - Tegan: I expect
28 Jan 08:19 - Tegan: Also lol, sam
28 Jan 08:41 - Sam Roberts: Talking of becoming a pensioner, it's m' birthday next Friday (6th), save the date for some drinking fun
28 Jan 08:49 - Adam Wills: Saved! What are we gonna do?
28 Jan 09:11 - Sam Roberts: Working on it just at the mo, suggestions welcome
28 Jan 09:11 - Sam Roberts: The only certainty is that there will be beers

28 Jan 09:33 - Shaggy: Oh right
28 Jan 09:33 - Alex Bunn: Too early
28 Jan 09:35 - Tegan: Sorry y'all
28 Jan 09:36 - Tegan: The sound you can probably hear is me cursing the day
28 Jan 12:48 - Sam Roberts: <Media omitted>

29 Jan 15:59 - Joe Jarman: What time you there sam
29 Jan 15:59 - Joe Jarman: I'm celebrating dodging a bankruptcy bullet
29 Jan 16:00 - Alex Bunn: Did you get redundancy?
29 Jan 16:02 - Joe Jarman: Not yet haha
29 Jan 16:02 - Joe Jarman: I'm just thankful for my student overdraft

29 Jan 17:31 - Bongo: Sweet I'm in
29 Jan 17:31 - Bongo: Like beef shin
29 Jan 17:31 - Bongo: <Media omitted>
29 Jan 17:31 - Bongo: Rubbed in garlic, parsley salt and balsal, left to cook for 8 hours
29 Jan 17:32 - Owen: Stab holes in it and push the garlic into the holes. It caramalises and infuses the meat when it cooks.
29 Jan 17:33 - Joe Jarman: See you at dlr?
29 Jan 17:33 - Owen: Trust me. Its a may zing!
29 Jan 17:33 - Dave: I'll be there in a min
29 Jan 17:34 - Shaggy: Garlic caramelises?
29 Jan 17:35 - Joe Jarman: When
29 Jan 17:35 - Joe Jarman: I'm there
29 Jan 17:35 - Joe Jarman: Smoking
29 Jan 17:36 - Dave: Now
29 Jan 17:37 - Joe Jarman: Canne c u jimmee
29 Jan 17:48 - Owen: Yeah garlic caramalises. If you deprive it of oxygen.
29 Jan 17:48 - Owen: Try wrapping a bulb of garlic in foil and sticking it in the oven at 180 for an hour. It comes out sticky and sweet but still as garlicy.
29 Jan 17:49 - Shaggy: Sweet
29 Jan 17:51 - Tegan: Mmmmmm
29 Jan 17:51 - Tegan: I'm going for a leaving drink, will join y'all afters

29 Jan 19:50 - Sam Roberts: Opposite the fellow, but they don't have a pin so I used the fellow one
29 Jan 19:50 - Sam Roberts: To be fair, happy hours over, and they don't have any Nintendo do we should probs move on
29 Jan 19:51 - Sam Roberts: Here for now though
29 Jan 20:44 - Tegan: Whattupp y'all?
29 Jan 20:46 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: We're in the same place
29 Jan 20:49 - Tegan: Surely the appeal wears off at 7?

29 Jan 20:50 - Tegan: On my wat5
29 Jan 20:50 - Joe Jarman: It's still cheap!
29 Jan 20:50 - Tegan: Sright

29 Jan 20:58 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: Where there's a will there's a wat5
29 Jan 21:13 - Tegan: WAT5 MOTHERLICKERS
29 Jan 21:14 - Tegan: It's snowing
29 Jan 21:16 - Vinay: Where? Its dry as a baboons backside here
29 Jan 21:16 - Tegan: Kx
29 Jan 21:16 - Vinay: I got all excited
29 Jan 21:16 - Owen: Damn you teegs you made me look out the window.
29 Jan 21:17 - Owen: I was disappointed
29 Jan 21:17 - Vinay: Same
29 Jan 21:17 - Tegan: It won't settle
29 Jan 21:17 - Tegan: It's mainly damp
29 Jan 21:17 - Owen: Watch "Hercules - DISAPPOINTED" on YouTube - Hercules - DISAPPOINTED: http://youtu.be/_O1hM-k3aUY
29 Jan 21:17 - Tegan: Definite snowfall here though
30 Jan 09:32 - Martha: What plans for tonight? I'm in need of a chilled one - I'm thinking good food and films/episodes and a comfy couch. Shabong? Canning t? What say you?
30 Jan 09:35 - Shaggy: Team bonding exercise with work, meaning team bonds with alcohol, somewhere near work
30 Jan 09:35 - Owen: Whatever you do don't be hungover tomorrow Marth
30 Jan 09:36 - Alex Bunn: I'm going to a medieval banquet in st katherines docks
30 Jan 09:36 - Alex Bunn: Its gonna be ossum
30 Jan 09:41 - Tegan: I'm up for an episode of something Marth
30 Jan 09:41 - Tegan: I'm in c town
30 Jan 09:54 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: Someone told me a good comedy film called Chef came out last year, anyone up for that?
30 Jan 11:00 - Martha: Sure, awesome! Teegs - are you heading to Sutton on Saturday morning too? It will make the epic trek from canning t infinitely more enjoyable.
30 Jan 11:07 - Dave: I'd like to see chef - it's downloaded already
30 Jan 11:15 - Owen: 1 hour an epic trek does not make.
30 Jan 11:33 - Martha: Indeed, but 1h27 is getting there.
30 Jan 11:33 - Martha: <Media omitted>
30 Jan 11:34 - Sam Roberts: Uber
30 Jan 11:41 - Tegan: I think I'll have to wend my way home tonight as my laundry situation is pretty dire
30 Jan 11:41 - Tegan: But we can meet at lb or wherever the train goes from
30 Jan 11:52 - Owen: Thats a stupid way to go.
30 Jan 11:52 - Owen: Jubilee to Canada water. Overground to west croydon. Mainline to sutton.
30 Jan 11:53 - Owen: That is the best way. Takes about 1hour if you get the right train.
30 Jan 12:53 - Martha: Aw rats, I thought you and Dave were coming. Owen is there a critical number of people below which we might be forced to drink, eat cake and play Catan?
30 Jan 12:54 - Owen: Teegs is coming. Dave is not
30 Jan 12:55 - Owen: At the moment the list is: marth, teegs, steve, alice, lara, jim, eliza.
30 Jan 12:55 - Owen: So quite a few
30 Jan 13:41 - Lorna: By the way guys, chef is awesome! Comedy that gives you a warm gooey heartwarming feel. With shit loads of food porn. Eat before or line up and epic meat/cheese snack for afters.
30 Jan 14:07 - Alex Bunn: <Media omitted>
30 Jan 18:35 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: OK, so what do you think is the biggest animal by mass that you could have in a fight?
30 Jan 18:36 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: It is trying to kill you
30 Jan 18:36 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: No weapons, MMA octagon stylee
30 Jan 18:36 - Tegan: Could definitely take a cat
30 Jan 18:36 - Tegan: Or cat sized dog
30 Jan 18:36 - Owen: Blue whale.
30 Jan 18:37 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: Land animal
30 Jan 18:37 - Tegan: Probably not a Badger
30 Jan 18:37 - Owen: It's own weight would kill it in an mma octagon
30 Jan 18:39 - Lorna: Could definitely take a giant tortoise. Though its unlikely to ever try and kill me.
30 Jan 18:39 - Martha: Sloth
30 Jan 18:39 - Tegan: Good thinking lorna
30 Jan 18:39 - Tegan: Heavy but slow animals
30 Jan 18:40 - Owen: Maybe a crocodile. They can't open thier jaws if you apply a little force to them. I am not sure how I would kill it though. Maybe finger through the eye to the brain.
30 Jan 18:40 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: You could not even hope to hurt a tortoise though
30 Jan 18:41 - Owen: Kick it in the balls!
30 Jan 18:41 - Owen: No animal can cope with that.
30 Jan 18:41 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: Unless you flip it over and they're well heavy
30 Jan 18:42 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: I feel I could take a giraffe somehow
30 Jan 18:42 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: Would need a good strategy
30 Jan 18:42 - Owen: No way!
30 Jan 18:42 - Martha: I feel that you would find you cant
30 Jan 18:42 - Owen: Have you seen those fuckers fight?
30 Jan 18:43 - Owen: They neck whip each other.
30 Jan 18:43 - Owen: Giraffes are BAD ASS!
30 Jan 18:43 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: You got to trip it over somehow
30 Jan 18:43 - Shaggy: <Media omitted>
30 Jan 18:44 - Lorna: I'd flip that tortoise and elbow drop it. WWF style
30 Jan 18:46 - Tegan: Dang
30 Jan 18:47 - Lorna: Or a panda. Anyone could take a panda
30 Jan 18:49 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: Again, I think it would be tough to harm a panda
30 Jan 18:50 - Tegan: Are you allowed a rope?
30 Jan 18:50 - Alex Bunn: Yeah pandas suck
30 Jan 18:50 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: You'd have to hurt its feelings somehow
30 Jan 18:50 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: No ropes
30 Jan 18:50 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: I reckon a cow is doable
30 Jan 18:51 - Owen: A cow is basically a bull without horns though
30 Jan 18:51 - Tegan: Cows ares pretty solid
30 Jan 18:52 - Tegan: I reckon you could kick a sheep to death
30 Jan 18:52 - Owen: I don't really know how to kill any animal
30 Jan 18:52 - Owen: Except a chicken.
30 Jan 18:52 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: Giraffe you can strangle I reckon
30 Jan 18:52 - Martha: Guys this is pretty dark.
30 Jan 18:52 - Martha: Who started this?
30 Jan 18:52 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: Dave
30 Jan 18:53 - Martha: Mmm really?
30 Jan 18:53 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: Actually I'm continuing a convo from lunch
30 Jan 18:53 - Martha: My bets are on you for some reason
30 Jan 18:53 - Owen: I think you underestimate how big a giraffe's neck is.
30 Jan 18:53 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: It was much darker than this...
30 Jan 18:57 - Tegan: Mike, are you heading back to watch chef tonight?
30 Jan 18:57 - Bongo: A massive capybara
30 Jan 18:58 - Bongo: <Media omitted>
30 Jan 18:59 - Bongo: They're pretty much punching bags
30 Jan 18:59 - Bongo: They weigh a tonne and I bet they're so chilled they'd just let you punch them until they die
30 Jan 19:04 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: Yeah I'm at pub, leaving in 10
30 Jan 19:05 - Tegan: Aiight
30 Jan 19:37 - Dave: I could take an ostrich
30 Jan 19:38 - Martha: There in 30 xxx
30 Jan 19:38 - Dave: Whoop
30 Jan 19:39 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: Roman numeral bants
30 Jan 19:40 - Tegan: Niiice
30 Jan 19:47 - Bongo: I'm bored and ill, anyone want to come entertain me?
30 Jan 19:47 - Bongo: Probably one of the least tempting offers I've ever made but that just shows how extremely ill I am
30 Jan 20:15 - Tegan: Sorry dude - I'm being bored and ill over here
30 Jan 20:16 - Tegan: I would recommend the David Attenborough on the beeb about birds of paradise
30 Jan 20:16 - Tegan: The voice is medicine, and the birds are silly
30 Jan 20:29 - Tegan: Mike
30 Jan 20:29 - Tegan: Bring more wine
30 Jan 20:30 - Tegan: And Yorkshire puddings
30 Jan 20:30 - Tegan: Loads of Yorkshire puddings
30 Jan 20:30 - Dave: Plz
30 Jan 20:39 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: Yorkshire puddings?
30 Jan 20:39 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: Also Dave, are you nuts, an ostrich would kick your face off
30 Jan 20:40 - Dave: Yup x many
30 Jan 20:40 - Dave: Nah mate, I'd dodge it's kick and punch it in the beak
30 Jan 20:40 - Dave: BAM!
30 Jan 20:40 - Joe Jarman: Bongo
30 Jan 20:40 - Joe Jarman: Come here
30 Jan 20:40 - Joe Jarman: And we will look after you
30 Jan 20:40 - Joe Jarman: Ill send an uber
30 Jan 20:41 - Joe Jarman: Got some free credits
30 Jan 20:41 - Dave: Or maybe wrestle it
30 Jan 20:41 - Owen: Dave you can't dodge a balcony how are you gonna dodge an ostrich!?

6 Feb 18:21 - Bongo: On the bus, be there in 5 hours
6 Feb 18:21 - Bongo: Because that's how bloody long it takes to get anywhere on a bus in London
6 Feb 18:22 - Sam Roberts: Bus? You mean the peasant wagon
6 Feb 18:22 - Bongo: Amen
6 Feb 18:23 - Bongo: I bet none of these herberts have even ever tried gold-flecked champagne with their cereal before

7 Feb 08:23 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: Ow my brain üòñ
7 Feb 09:06 - Bongo: Lol I literally saw you passed out on the couch, did you wake up to text that?
7 Feb 09:14 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: Passed out from the overexertion of texting that
7 Feb 09:54 - Bongo: Children of the third world have to walk for 2 hours each day to get fresh water
7 Feb 09:54 - Bongo: But that's nothing compared to the harsh climates that some people live in the uk
7 Feb 09:55 - Bongo: Donate ¬£2 a month to provide mike with a monkey butler so that he doesn't have to waste energy texting
7 Feb 09:56 - Tegan: Can I have a monkey butler for ¬£2 a month?
7 Feb 09:56 - Tegan: I'm not after charity, I'll fund my own
7 Feb 10:02 - Bongo: Hmm yea I want one too
7 Feb 10:03 - Bongo: Screw mike, I'm getting a fleet of monkey butlers
7 Feb 10:03 - Bongo: Fleet is the collective noun for monkey butlers right?

7 Feb 18:17 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: Big hero 6 was class!

7 Feb 21:40 - Sam Roberts: Looks like a dnd wet dream
7 Feb 21:49 - Pete Morey: Basically
10 Feb 14:13 - Bongo: That Strauss Khan sex party story is hilarious
10 Feb 14:13 - Bongo: "Okay I pimped girls at sex parties, but that was only like 12 times"
10 Feb 14:14 - Bongo: And someone else who regularly attended is all like "I was there for professional reasons" lol
10 Feb 15:57 - Owen: Give the guy a break he only had 12 sex parties over the course of 3 years. Thats a 3 month wait between sex parties. I have to wait less time between holidays!
10 Feb 15:58 - Owen: Also he, and I quote: "did it for fun." We can all sympathise with that nobel aim.
10 Feb 16:00 - Tegan: Classy
10 Feb 16:00 - Tegan: He was going to be the head of the IMF a few years ago
10 Feb 16:00 - Tegan: The IMF could use more sex patios
10 Feb 16:00 - Tegan: Parties dammit
10 Feb 16:03 - Owen: They face charges of "aggravated pimping." I know aggravated probably has a legal definition but i cannot stop picturing him as some kind of super pimp with mega chains and a massive furry hat.
10 Feb 16:04 - Owen: Sex patios also sound good teegs
10 Feb 16:11 - Hannah Murphy: Bongo give him some slack - it was 12 parties across three years, so only four a year
10 Feb 16:12 - Owen: Repost!!!
10 Feb 16:40 - Tegan: Who doesn't throw quarterly sex parties?
10 Feb 16:41 - Owen: They sink up with tax day
10 Feb 16:46 - Vanessa: Here's my rant, I can't believe after so many years with the 100ml rule at airport security you STILL get people completely dumbfounded when their shampoo gets taken away
10 Feb 16:47 - Owen: But I am special so surely the rules don't apply to me.
10 Feb 16:48 - Vanessa: Yes, I forgot, it's in the small print
10 Feb 17:08 - Shaggy: Oh I thought it's 100ml only for explosive liquids
10 Feb 17:27 - Tegan: Yup. Only solid explosives in larger quantities.
10 Feb 17:27 - Tegan: Or in they have to be in your checked luggage
10 Feb 18:33 - Bongo: And definitely no alan keys right Sam?
10 Feb 18:33 - Bongo: You terrorist
10 Feb 18:39 - Bongo: 1) who brings an alan key with them on holiday
10 Feb 18:40 - Bongo: 2) why does it get banned from taken on the flight
10 Feb 18:57 - Shaggy: I had bike tools taken away from me as well
10 Feb 20:29 - Sam Roberts: Fascists with their ridiculous rules on bike gear
10 Feb 20:30 - Sam Roberts: Must be to limit bike thefts in India
12 Feb 13:09 - Tegan: <Media omitted>

12 Feb 13:25 - Tegan: All Sri Lanka lacks is a big group of lads

12 Feb 13:43 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: Hitting the big Jesus this eve I think
12 Feb 13:44 - Tegan: Don't hit him
12 Feb 13:44 - Tegan: He had enough stick when he was alive
12 Feb 13:45 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: Yeah and you wouldn't like big Jesus when he's angry
12 Feb 13:46 - Tegan: Damn right
12 Feb 13:46 - Tegan: He is of second coming prop proportions
12 Feb 15:35 - Owen: I live!
12 Feb 15:53 - Owen: I thought I had killed my phone by rooting it. But i hadn't
12 Feb 15:59 - Tegan: Owen!
12 Feb 16:15 - Sam Roberts: Can it do awesome stuff now it's rooted?
12 Feb 16:17 - Owen: I can delete apps that were locked by the OS

12 Feb 16:18 - Sam Roberts: Ah fuck, how easy was it?

12 Feb 18:05 - Henry Dranks: congratulations joeee!
12 Feb 18:05 - Henry Dranks: Did it work owen?
12 Feb 18:33 - Owen: Nah it was too much effort keeping track of everything. It also became a bit distracting because kids would argue for xp.
12 Feb 18:33 - Owen: This looks like it will remove those problems.
12 Feb 19:23 - Bongo: Cool pic, I can forgive it even though it's in paradise
12 Feb 19:23 - Bongo: I might have to lead this group when everyone whips out the carnival pics
12 Feb 19:24 - Owen: Congratulations Joe!!!

12 Feb 20:27 - Joe Jarman: Obviously I didnt
12 Feb 20:32 - Vanessa: I know a couple who actually made up their last name
12 Feb 20:33 - Vanessa: I thought that was pretty original
12 Feb 20:34 - Shaggy: Did they randomly put their names together with a hyphen in between?
12 Feb 20:34 - Vanessa: Nope they actually made a new name using their old names as guidance
12 Feb 20:34 - Vanessa: Gordan and Leech to make Leedon
12 Feb 20:35 - Vanessa: Her husband's mother was not too pleased
12 Feb 20:35 - Shaggy: Anagram contest!

12 Feb 20:39 - Shaggy: Dong is good too
12 Feb 20:39 - Shaggy: Omg, it can be Horde
12 Feb 20:39 - Shaggy: They missed out
12 Feb 20:40 - Shaggy: If I was her husband's mother I would be unhappy too
12 Feb 20:45 - Vanessa: Why? Because they should have gone with Horde?
12 Feb 21:45 - Owen: Bomes or Jott would be ours
13 Feb 01:51 - Tegan: Obvs you should both have taken Liza's name

17 Feb 13:12 - Tegan: Let us know what you neeeed

17 Feb 14:33 - Adam Wills: Can you do this again next week? I'm waiting for my baggage in an airport, and this chat is making me well hungry!

17 Feb 15:04 - Tegan: Roger on the ricotta etc
17 Feb 15:17 - Adam Wills: Just came back to Bangalore from Kashmir... FYI for all snowboarders - Go to gulmarg in Kashmir for a once in a lifetime snowboarding experience... I would be so up for doing that again (sewing a little seed for next season - Feb is the time to do it)
17 Feb 15:17 - Adam Wills: But seriously can you do pancakes again next week??
17 Feb 15:18 - Shaggy: We can definitely have more pancakes, what kind of question is that?

17 Feb 18:45 - Tegan: How many are coming?

17 Feb 18:46 - Martha: Me + teegs + Lorna + shaggy + bongo = 5+...
17 Feb 18:48 - Shaggy: Vinay. Angie made a noise earlier
17 Feb 18:48 - Angela: I did! Just looking at trains from mine now
17 Feb 18:49 - Angela: Is there free parking near yours? Feeling lazy
17 Feb 18:49 - Angela: And what can I bring?
17 Feb 18:53 - Tegan: My only request is lemons
17 Feb 18:53 - Angela: All my trains to elephant are cancelled! What treachery is this!
17 Feb 18:54 - Shaggy: There is but I suspect not free, I will be home shortly and check
17 Feb 18:56 - Angela: Cool thanks, trains are all cancelled til 7.40 and then it says bulletin on the service, whatever that means
17 Feb 19:03 - Shaggy: Yup you can park downstairs
17 Feb 19:04 - Angela: Woohoo! I'll be there in about 30 then, with lemons!
17 Feb 19:11 - Tegan: If anyone is with Dave, could you tell him I plan to leave his key in the gas lockers? Or find out if he had the spares?

17 Feb 19:22 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: Dave has the spares

17 Feb 19:29 - Lorna: Passed him. I'm outside
17 Feb 23:04 - Tegan: Sooooo pancaked

18 Feb 10:37 - Shaggy: Matt Berry: Wildlove
18 Feb 11:45 - Tegan: Research confirms there is no such thing as a carpet pigeon. .. so what was that funky bird?
18 Feb 11:59 - Hannah Murphy: WHAT THE FUCK WAS THAT
18 Feb 18:42 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: Man its really weird to feel cold again
18 Feb 18:42 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: Kind of comforting
18 Feb 18:54 - Sam Roberts: It's nice being back in England in all its drizzly glory
18 Feb 18:56 - Sam Roberts: Well jealous of the pancake chat
18 Feb 19:35 - Bongo: We'll probs have another one next week
18 Feb 19:36 - Bongo: It's a little known fact that there was a second, more popular Saint of pancakes who's favourite topping was beer
18 Feb 19:36 - Bongo: His day is next week
18 Feb 19:39 - Sam Roberts: Ah, the festival of St Beercakes, how could I forget?
18 Feb 19:42 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: He drove all the teetotallers out of Ireland
18 Feb 22:26 - Tegan: Yo, Dave's heading over in the AM to collect his bizniz from C town- he should be there for 8.30
18 Feb 22:27 - Tegan: Can someone let him in?
18 Feb 22:39 - Sam Roberts: Lemme check with Ferenc, else might have to be a smidge earlier

18 Feb 22:45 - Sam Roberts: His number's just coming, if he doesn't answer just give him a call
18 Feb 22:46 - Sam Roberts: One of us will probably be around anyway, swearing about having to leave the house
18 Feb 22:46 - Sam Roberts: Ferenc Fernando.vcf (file attached)
19 Feb 07:31 - Tegan: Dave's phone is bezonked, so he won't be able to phone anyone
19 Feb 07:33 - Tegan: But he is on his way eta 8.25

20 Feb 00:01 - Bongo: "Sometimes people write novels and they just be so wordy and self-absorbed. I am not a fan of books. I would never want a book's autograph. I am a proud non-reader of books" - actual quote of Kanye west
20 Feb 07:56 - Tegan: Books can be wordy

20 Feb 18:42 - Lorna: Not sensing much enthusiasm for drinking tonight...
20 Feb 18:43 - Tegan: Everyone else is lame
20 Feb 18:43 - Tegan: Come boogying!
20 Feb 18:46 - Lorna: Where're you going to be? And when?
20 Feb 18:47 - Tegan: Do you fancy dinner at ours?  I'm around kx now having a beer but we probably don't want to go out til later

20 Feb 23:08 - Dave: What time?

20 Feb 23:11 - Owen: So we will be in London from 10/11ish
20 Feb 23:13 - Dave: In the morning I assume
20 Feb 23:13 - Owen: Yeah
20 Feb 23:13 - Owen: 6:30am
20 Feb 23:13 - Owen: But if we stay home we will just sleep and that will fuck me up for work
20 Feb 23:14 - Krizia: Ahhhhh mexxiiico!  ‚ù§üòçüòçüòç
20 Feb 23:14 - Dave: K - my parents may be down but if not then maybe
20 Feb 23:14 - Krizia: It's it amazing or wwhhhaaaaattttt? ??
20 Feb 23:15 - Krizia: Say Hi to Phil!
20 Feb 23:15 - Krizia: Pretty though to stay awake!!
20 Feb 23:18 - Owen: Phil says hi too
20 Feb 23:19 - Owen: Chinese new year in London is one of the simultaneously best and worst things ever
20 Feb 23:19 - Owen: Its like watching a movie that's so bad it's good.
20 Feb 23:45 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: Hey that new breaking bad show has started!
20 Feb 23:45 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: Better call Saul... Has anyone watched it?
21 Feb 00:00 - Bongo: Yep
21 Feb 00:00 - Bongo: Pretty good
21 Feb 00:01 - Bongo: Not nearly as good as breaking bad
21 Feb 10:12 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: Yeah it's not bad so far
21 Feb 10:13 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: Less funny madcaps than I was expecting
21 Feb 11:21 - Pete Morey: I like it,  s'good...  Basically pre-bb Saul is pre cancer Walt
21 Feb 11:21 - Pete Morey: Same premise + arc,  but it's a good one so worth repeating
21 Feb 11:23 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: I dunno, slip and fall Saul?
21 Feb 11:24 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: He's pretty devious from the start
21 Feb 12:02 - Pete Morey: Yeah true
21 Feb 12:03 - Pete Morey: Slippin Jimmy
21 Feb 12:04 - Pete Morey: I'm shutting up about it now, in case spoilers etc
21 Feb 12:06 - Pete Morey: Random pc question for anyone who might be able to help:
21 Feb 12:09 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: Turn it off and on again
21 Feb 12:11 - Pete Morey: I just bought pc and ssd - I wanna put the os on the ssd but it has come pre loaded on the hdd. No installation disk and any legit online source for installation is an 'update' rather than original install.  Anywhere I can get a windows 8 installation?  Any other suggestions about how to proceed??
21 Feb 12:11 - Pete Morey: Sorry:I tried bashing with a rock already
21 Feb 12:17 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: Are you sure you want windows 8?
21 Feb 12:17 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: I've heard it's weird
21 Feb 12:18 - Pete Morey: Yeah it's weird... Too late now I got it
21 Feb 12:19 - Pete Morey: It tries to turn windows into an app system or smt
21 Feb 12:20 - Pete Morey: It's my cheapest option cos I got a product key with the pc
21 Feb 12:22 - Sam Roberts: We've got a Windows 7 bit usb with a crack somewhere, can use that
21 Feb 12:23 - Sam Roberts: If you're on 8, get the 8.1 update and you can run a proper desktop. All the panel stuff is weak unless you're using it as a touch screen
21 Feb 12:23 - Pete Morey: Yeah?
21 Feb 12:23 - Pete Morey: Or maybe I could transfer 7 from my old laptop
21 Feb 12:23 - Pete Morey: I'm checking that out now
21 Feb 12:24 - Pete Morey: How do I get the 7 windows of ye Sam?
21 Feb 12:28 - Pete Morey: Oh yeah I have 8.1 sorry yeah
21 Feb 12:32 - Sam Roberts: I've got to do mine sometime, Windows party Monday night?
21 Feb 12:34 - Pete Morey: Haha sounds fun.  I might have a solution from my housemate by then,  but YES in principle.  How does a windows party work then?
21 Feb 12:38 - Sam Roberts: You come round about 8, we celebrate everything Windows
21 Feb 12:38 - Sam Roberts: Looking out of them, opening, closing, the LOT
21 Feb 12:39 - Pete Morey: .. Maybe we could put our pc s together in a room/pit and encourage them to kiss
21 Feb 12:39 - Pete Morey: ... And/or fight...
21 Feb 12:40 - Pete Morey: We could take bets
21 Feb 12:40 - Pete Morey: On outcomes etc
21 Feb 12:41 - Pete Morey: Godammit this isn't helping with my OS/Ssd problem at all...
21 Feb 12:43 - Pete Morey: (it takes me two hours to get to canning town btw.  We'd best have the windows party at a decent mid point.  Or mine.)
21 Feb 12:47 - Sam Roberts: <Media omitted>
21 Feb 12:48 - Pete Morey: <Media omitted>
21 Feb 12:49 - Bongo: For some reason I read that as visual communication helps thinking
21 Feb 12:49 - Pete Morey: It does!
21 Feb 12:51 - Pete Morey: .. But maybe not when trying to plan a windows party w sam
21 Feb 12:51 - Pete Morey: Especially in negotiating a venue that isn't Sam's place...
21 Feb 12:57 - Bongo: Yea that sucks just go with 7
21 Feb 13:29 - Shaggy: Sam I think mentioned about some utility that moves windows over? Did you try it last time you messed with your PC? Clean install would be best anyways, your PC probably comes with a bunch of preinstalled bullshit anyway. How big is the ssd?
21 Feb 13:42 - Pete Morey: Oh hey.  Yeah ideally I want clean install but my pc didn't come with install disk
21 Feb 13:43 - Pete Morey: So I got the product key from the pc and am looking for a standard install iso online
21 Feb 13:43 - Pete Morey: Actually,  I would prefer a USB install
21 Feb 13:44 - Pete Morey: Cos I don't have did drive
21 Feb 13:44 - Shaggy: You need to pirate that shit, you won't find one to download
21 Feb 13:44 - Pete Morey: The ssd is 120gigs
21 Feb 13:44 - Shaggy: Ok that's enough for windows
21 Feb 13:44 - Pete Morey: *DVD
21 Feb 13:45 - Pete Morey: Yeah I thought so.  Windows plus Adobe and office programs I hope
21 Feb 13:46 - Pete Morey: Can I not just use a standard install cd as long as I have the product key?
21 Feb 13:46 - Pete Morey: (which is downloadable)
21 Feb 13:47 - Pete Morey: (or I thought it would be)
21 Feb 13:47 - Shaggy: It's not
21 Feb 13:47 - Pete Morey: Wow that's shit
21 Feb 13:47 - Shaggy: Yup
21 Feb 13:48 - Pete Morey: Can I not just use someone else's install cd then?  No crack needed cos I have legit cd key
21 Feb 13:52 - Shaggy: Don't have windows 8, 'm afraid
21 Feb 13:54 - Pete Morey: 8.1?
21 Feb 13:54 - Shaggy: Same thing
21 Feb 13:55 - Pete Morey: Bum bum
21 Feb 13:55 - Pete Morey: What about transfer from hdd to ssd?
21 Feb 13:56 - Pete Morey: I'll go away do some research now...
21 Feb 13:57 - Dave: Take it to nerdgasm people
21 Feb 14:04 - Pete Morey: Nerdgasm?
21 Feb 14:14 - Dave: It's a dark world where discussions on computers take place
21 Feb 14:28 - Pete Morey: Oh OK.  I could join that if I wasn't immediately 'noobed'  or smt
21 Feb 14:28 - Pete Morey: 'hazed'
21 Feb 14:28 - Pete Morey: 'bummed'
21 Feb 14:41 - Pete Morey: Cool,  conversation moved

21 Feb 19:54 - Alex Bunn: Did you get football pie all over your face?

25 Feb 11:45 - Shaggy: Visio is for making diagrams not presentations

26 Feb 17:09 - Owen: Five guys. I thought they were exclusively American.
26 Feb 17:10 - Angela: Loads of people in my office were eating those for lunch, even though it took them 20 mins on the bus to get there
26 Feb 17:25 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: I kind of wanted to die when I finished it

27 Feb 12:15 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: <Media omitted>
27 Feb 12:15 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: White and gold, or blue and black?
27 Feb 12:15 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: http://gizmodo.com/what-the-fuck-is-wrong-with-your-eyes-a-dress-explaine-1688364883
27 Feb 12:16 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: Fucking weird, loads of people at work see it as white and gold üò¶
27 Feb 12:23 - Alex Bunn: Depends on the photo
27 Feb 12:23 - Alex Bunn: And the camera exposure
27 Feb 12:28 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: Unless you think it has a blue filter on it, I don't know how you can see that as white
27 Feb 12:30 - Alex Bunn: Its not
27 Feb 12:30 - Alex Bunn: But iv seen other photos where its def white
27 Feb 12:32 - Krizia: White
27 Feb 12:32 - Vanessa: Yea it depends which phone you're looking at
27 Feb 12:33 - Vanessa: I've seen it both
27 Feb 12:34 - Krizia: <Media omitted>
27 Feb 12:34 - Krizia: That's from my mexi friends
27 Feb 12:34 - Krizia: It says I saw it blue and black and then white and gold hahahah
27 Feb 12:41 - Sam Roberts: I can see why Phil likes it over there now ;)
27 Feb 12:42 - Sam Roberts: Everyone seeing it as blue now? I got it from someone at work earlier, on the pc I could make it change by concentrating
27 Feb 12:43 - Sam Roberts: It really messed me up for ten minutes
27 Feb 12:44 - Shaggy: What? It totally white and gold
27 Feb 12:45 - Pete Morey: I'm gettin b+b
27 Feb 12:51 - Dave: Blue and black (the dress, right?)
27 Feb 12:57 - Eliza: So I saw this online, and I know the dress is blue and black and I know this isn't a weird conspiracy or practical joke. But goddamn I can't for the life of me see it as anything other than a white and gold dress in shadow.
27 Feb 12:57 - Owen: Wow!
27 Feb 12:58 - Pete Morey: Freaky...  So it's a screen thing?
27 Feb 12:58 - Owen: Does the white in shadow look at all blue to you?
27 Feb 12:58 - Sam Roberts: Not a screen thing
27 Feb 12:59 - Sam Roberts: It's a mind thing
27 Feb 12:59 - Owen: It's a colour perception thing
27 Feb 12:59 - Sam Roberts: What even are eyes?
27 Feb 12:59 - Eliza: Yes, it looks like blueish shadow. But it looks like the dress should be white (and gold) in proper lighting.
27 Feb 13:00 - Owen: What colour do the highlights on the blue look like?
27 Feb 13:00 - Owen: Also come open the door!
27 Feb 13:01 - Pete Morey: Wow
27 Feb 13:02 - Pete Morey: But the screen doesn't contribute at all??
27 Feb 13:12 - Sam Roberts: This one looks a lot more blue than on the computer. Unless I put them next to each other...
27 Feb 13:15 - Vanessa: On the left side there is a two tone clothing behind the dress, what colours do people see and is it the same as the main dress?
27 Feb 13:20 - Shaggy: <Media omitted>
27 Feb 13:24 - Pete Morey: So is it to do with colour blindness or is a more nuanced aspect of,  for eg,  complementary colour perception? (within an ordinary range)
27 Feb 13:26 - Hannah Murphy: Eyes: what are?
27 Feb 13:31 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: The one I posted is the original and there are a lot of people who see white and gold even if you mess about with the brightness etc.
27 Feb 13:32 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: It's probly something to do with rods and cones in the eye
27 Feb 13:32 - Owen: Possibly people with fewer blue cones see white and gold.
27 Feb 13:34 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: <Media omitted>
27 Feb 13:38 - Owen: The dress is the same blue in both examples.
27 Feb 13:45 - Alex Bunn: Just went back to the photo. Its changed colour
27 Feb 13:46 - Sam Roberts: I read a thing saying it's not in the eye ie rods and cones, apparently there's a massive range of proportions naturally that has almost no impact on colour perception
27 Feb 13:46 - Sam Roberts: I call Kant
27 Feb 13:48 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: This is like the biggest thing on the internet in a long time üò¶
27 Feb 13:49 - Vanessa: I think this is basically an experiment to prove the point that nobody sees things the same way
27 Feb 13:54 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: I don't think it was an experiment, someone just posted the picture on Facebook and it's completely exploded
27 Feb 14:12 - Sam Roberts: Everyone going to this comedy tonight? Where is it?
27 Feb 14:22 - Pete Morey: <Media omitted>
27 Feb 14:23 - Pete Morey: Hey its near where I'm working on this animation project :)

2 Mar 07:32 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: I watched Godzilla vs Mothra recently
2 Mar 07:33 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: It's like watching power rangers when they get all big
2 Mar 07:44 - Sam Roberts: That was always the best bit of power rangers
2 Mar 07:45 - Sam Roberts: The only point of that show was to teach kids good things happen if you wait
2 Mar 07:46 - Eliza: I'm thinking Power Rangers marathon, anyone else?
2 Mar 07:54 - Shaggy: Hella no. I made a mistake of watching it again when I was 16, I was bitterly disappointed
2 Mar 07:54 - Sam Roberts: You probably didn't have costumes and themed food though
2 Mar 08:09 - Owen: That show was hella racist!
2 Mar 08:09 - Owen: The yellow ranger was chinese and the black ranger was black.
2 Mar 08:13 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: I think you'll find they were blue and white owen
2 Mar 08:30 - Eliza: Wait, wasn't there also a white power ranger?! A WHITE POWER ranger?
2 Mar 08:39 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: Yo guys, I made this last night, I think it's quite fun, The Horde over time in one image : http://uppix.com/f-big_file54f421020018708d.png

2 Mar 10:09 - Owen: I love that godzilla was the biggest word last may!
2 Mar 10:09 - Owen: I must have really be looking forward to that film
2 Mar 10:09 - Hannah Murphy: Hahahaj we were certainly rowdy in November:
2 Mar 10:09 - Owen: Been*
2 Mar 10:10 - Hannah Murphy: Lads lads shots girls
2 Mar 10:10 - Owen: I also like the progression from beers to shots as winter progresses
2 Mar 10:10 - Hannah Murphy: Oh yeah jan 2k14 when I posed the important "would you rather have teeth for pubes or pubes for teeth" question
2 Mar 10:11 - Hannah Murphy: Ah sweet memories
2 Mar 10:11 - Alex Bunn: Lol good times!
2 Mar 10:11 - Alex Bunn: I forgot about that one!
2 Mar 11:18 - Bongo: Lol that's awesome mike, is it really a frequency thing? Cus some of those don't sound like stuff we'd say a lot
2 Mar 11:18 - Bongo: Like "didn realise" unless that typo has been made a lot
2 Mar 11:38 - Vanessa: That's pretty cool
2 Mar 11:46 - Shaggy: Vanessa is not impressed

2 Mar 12:33 - Alex Bunn: You're on their a lot dude!
2 Mar 12:33 - Alex Bunn: There*
2 Mar 12:33 - Alex Bunn: eurgh

2 Mar 12:53 - Hannah Murphy: Bad news for the ladies:
2 Mar 12:54 - Hannah Murphy: <Media omitted>
2 Mar 12:54 - Pete Morey: Wow!
2 Mar 12:55 - Pete Morey: The Christian far right has been reading the profanisaurus
2 Mar 12:55 - Pete Morey: Or at least Viz
2 Mar 13:02 - Owen: @mike. Phil thanks you and Phil asks if you going to do individual word clouds over time as well.
2 Mar 13:02 - Alex Bunn: Lol. Save your soul, dont touch your hole!
2 Mar 13:06 - Hannah Murphy: The clitoris is the devil's doorbell!! If ya ring it he will answer
2 Mar 13:06 - Angela: Wow god is really micromanaging these days
2 Mar 13:07 - Hannah Murphy: But men - apparently you shouldn't touch you 'sin stick' either
2 Mar 13:18 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: Lol
2 Mar 13:20 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: My methodology was pretty careless, so there'll be lots of weird stuff there
2 Mar 13:21 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: Its based on relative frequency of words in each month, I'm trying to do it for all reddit comments, I'll redo it if I can be bothered to iron out the weirdness
2 Mar 13:23 - Alex Bunn: Reddit comments??
2 Mar 13:25 - Owen: ALL reddit comments?
2 Mar 13:25 - Owen: Thats some seriously big data!
2 Mar 14:05 - Pete Morey: http://viz.co.uk/rogers-profanisaurus-deansgate-tornado/
2 Mar 14:06 - Pete Morey: I couldn't find devil's doorbell on the online one,  but I know it's there somewhere....
2 Mar 14:07 - Pete Morey: ...  Cue extended jokes about finding the devil's doorbell:
2 Mar 14:10 - Sam Roberts: Redtube
2 Mar 17:29 - Alex Bunn: This isnt google Sam
2 Mar 18:28 - Bongo: I like to think of it as a salvation pillar rather than a sin stick
2 Mar 18:29 - Shaggy: I like to think of  it as a sin log
2 Mar 19:29 - Pete Morey: http://viz.co.uk/rogers-profanisaurus-the-elephant/
2 Mar 22:48 - Shaggy: Right gang table booked for tomorrow for 7:30pm http://www.sushicafe.co.uk/
2 Mar 22:48 - Bongo: Whoever can fit 30 sushi rolls in their mouth at once doesn't have to pick up the bill
2 Mar 22:51 - Krizia: Bring it on!!! :p
3 Mar 07:54 - Sam Roberts: Something something practice  *dirty grin*
3 Mar 07:55 - Shaggy: Something something something...you wish
3 Mar 11:17 - Owen: <Media omitted>
3 Mar 11:28 - Alex Bunn: Lol
3 Mar 11:28 - Alex Bunn: I wish hivernation was socially acceptable
3 Mar 11:31 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: Lol, I saw a bear comic today
3 Mar 11:32 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: <Media omitted>
3 Mar 11:33 - Shaggy: Haha
3 Mar 12:43 - Owen: <Media omitted>
3 Mar 12:51 - Tegan: Sweet thing O
3 Mar 12:52 - Tegan: Looks like the 9 sided dive in a futuristic rpg to me
3 Mar 12:52 - Tegan: Die
3 Mar 12:52 - Tegan: Dice
3 Mar 12:55 - Owen: Its actually a d6
3 Mar 12:58 - Tegan: There you go then
3 Mar 12:58 - Tegan: Could go to 9 though couldn't it
3 Mar 12:58 - Tegan: If you applied yourself
3 Mar 13:09 - Owen: Yeah. There are three variables that set max, min, and spins.
3 Mar 14:30 - Sam Roberts: So you can have a 3 sided die
3 Mar 14:30 - Sam Roberts: ?
3 Mar 14:40 - Shaggy: Which basically a 6 sided die with any two numbers for the three options
3 Mar 15:36 - Owen: I can
3 Mar 15:38 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: Or get a 3 sided dreidel!
3 Mar 15:39 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: #notjewish
3 Mar 16:40 - Owen: Are there any regular 3 sided 3D shapes?
3 Mar 16:40 - Owen: With flat plane surfaces?
3 Mar 16:40 - Owen: What about irregular?
3 Mar 16:43 - Shaggy: Cylinder is 3 sided
3 Mar 16:44 - Dave: üëè
3 Mar 16:44 - Owen: Nice
3 Mar 16:46 - Shaggy: I'm guessing it should be possible to design it so that it's equally likely to land any side up?
3 Mar 17:23 - Owen: Well a massive curved face will be landed on way more often than 1/3. A really thin curved face (like a coin) will almost never be landed on. So somewhere in between must be a size of face which is landed on 1/3rd of the time.

12 Mar 09:23 - Lorna: People of the horde: does anyone want to watch inherent vice at prince Charles cinema tonight? Or play some pool? I want to do one of those things tonight.
12 Mar 10:13 - Joe Jarman: Bongo can I have your mouse outfit ticket?
12 Mar 10:20 - Joe Jarman: New album is up on spotify üëç

12 Mar 10:26 - Joe Jarman: Gash
12 Mar 10:28 - Joe Jarman: How much is it
12 Mar 10:28 - Shaggy: 20 I think
12 Mar 10:29 - Joe Jarman: Ok I'll just buy one then, easy
12 Mar 10:31 - Dave: When's the gig? (And why was it not announced on gigs and giggles - you know the rules)
12 Mar 10:38 - Joe Jarman: Yeah I know I've just been searching for mouse on whatsapp everywhere and no hits!!

12 Mar 10:46 - Dave: I'm in leeds
12 Mar 11:13 - Pete Morey: <Media omitted>
12 Mar 11:21 - Owen: I am ashamed but I had to google non sequitur
12 Mar 11:22 - Owen: It's one of those words I understand when it is used but didn't know the definition of.
12 Mar 11:26 - Pete Morey: But is it 'non seck-wit-terrrr'  or 'non seckwitter'?
12 Mar 12:20 - Jimena: Why be ashamed? In some circles i know 'knowlege' of that sort is just another accessory people flaunt to raise themselves above others
12 Mar 12:22 - Jimena: Fuck the pretentiousness. The important things in life can be understood and discussed in simple words.
12 Mar 12:27 - Jimena: Of course i love words. And choosing the best one. But they are just the clothes that dress our ideas.
12 Mar 12:27 - Jimena: But thats just me ranting. So what DOES non sequitur mean üòÅ
12 Mar 12:43 - Pete Morey: It means 'random non related thing in sequence',  unconnected thing etc etc
12 Mar 12:43 - Pete Morey: It's a roof made of owls...
12 Mar 12:56 - Jimena: Ah like the 2 penguins are in the shower and one drops the soap joke
12 Mar 12:57 - Jimena: And then other penguin looks at him and says... "What do you think i am?! A shoe?!"
12 Mar 13:08 - Pete Morey: Yeah zackly
12 Mar 13:09 - Pete Morey: ...  Wait I don't geddit :p
12 Mar 13:10 - Pete Morey: ...  You know there's a no fly zone in Antarctica where loads of penguins live
12 Mar 13:10 - Pete Morey: ...  They kept looking up to see the planes,  following them with their heads and then falling on their backs
12 Mar 13:11 - Pete Morey: ...  Apparently penguins can't get up
12 Mar 13:11 - Pete Morey: So if your one picked up the soap he'd probably die
12 Mar 13:11 - Pete Morey: After being buggered
12 Mar 13:13 - Pete Morey: ....  So what's black and white and clean and red all over?
12 Mar 13:19 - Shaggy: That's the dumbest thing I've heard
12 Mar 13:20 - Shaggy: Penguins fall over all the time, they are clumsier than pandas
12 Mar 13:25 - Pete Morey: Wha?!  No way!!  -  pandas fall out of TREES.
12 Mar 13:25 - Shaggy: That's because trees are tricker than just standing on flat ground, believe it or not
12 Mar 13:26 - Pete Morey: And they're nearly extinct,  cos the male panda can't coordinate his winky into the fu-fu
12 Mar 13:26 - Shaggy: No man can do that
12 Mar 13:26 - Pete Morey: I bet penguins could
12 Mar 13:28 - Pete Morey: ..  Ask the one who picked up the soap
12 Mar 14:33 - Jimena: Fu-fu? Really? That's a new one for me
12 Mar 14:35 - Jimena: And i've heard it called a bunch of things: chichino, punani, mushy and the ever so crude 'beefcurtains' among others
12 Mar 14:38 - Jimena: Also how does picking up the soap equal falling over? Can they not pick things up either? Cause i cant fathom how a being that cant get up or pick up soap like things survives
12 Mar 14:41 - Tegan: I bet they could pick up the soap underwater
12 Mar 14:41 - Tegan: Maybe a creature more suited to baths...
12 Mar 15:25 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: Aw, Terry Pratchett
12 Mar 15:25 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: That sucks
12 Mar 15:52 - Tegan: That is sad
12 Mar 15:52 - Tegan: Only 66... But he's looked about 150 forever...
12 Mar 16:09 - Sam Roberts: Great books, Great man
12 Mar 16:13 - Jimena: Noooooo

12 Mar 20:22 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: In good news, Bill Watterson released his first book in like 15 years today!
12 Mar 20:22 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: <Media omitted>
12 Mar 20:38 - Bongo: No way!
12 Mar 20:39 - Bongo: That front cover looks suspiciously like one of his other ones though
12 Mar 21:01 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: It's not exactly a new anthology, more a retrospective
12 Mar 21:02 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: Only like ¬£10 on Amazon
12 Mar 21:03 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: Also the new mouse outfit album was awesome, bring on Saturday!
13 Mar 08:18 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: Don't forget Mother's day
13 Mar 08:51 - Shaggy: Your mother asked me to remind you, but looks like you're a good boy
13 Mar 09:11 - Mike Joyce: I actually forgot. ..i am terrible! !
13 Mar 09:14 - Dave: I made a scary card for my mum. She'll be so proud
13 Mar 09:30 - Joe Jarman: You can still make it if you post today!!!
13 Mar 10:22 - Pete Morey: Shit!
13 Mar 11:04 - Owen: A horse walks into a bar. The bartender asks the horse if it's an alcoholic considering all the bars he frequents, to which the horse replies "I don't think I am." POOF! The horse disappears. 

This is the point in time when all the philosophy students in the audience begin to giggle, as they are familiar with the philosophical proposition of Cogito ergo sum, or I think, therefore, I am.

But to explain the concept aforehand would be putting Descartes before the horse.
13 Mar 11:14 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: There was a really old askreddit thread about a guy who was genuinely in the same philosophy class as a porn star. Someone made a comment about not putting Descartes before the whores
13 Mar 11:15 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: It was the best reddit comment of all time
13 Mar 11:38 - Tegan: Right place right time, I guess
13 Mar 11:38 - Tegan: You can't plan for that shiz
13 Mar 19:08 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: Wooooo

13 Mar 19:50 - Tegan: By woodpecker
13 Mar 19:50 - Tegan: <Media omitted>
13 Mar 19:52 - Vinay: That is an amazing picture
13 Mar 19:53 - Tegan: It is one of the best things that had ever happened
13 Mar 19:54 - Tegan: Although apparently the baby critter is not trying to whimsically travel aboard the woodpecker, but to maim and kill it
13 Mar 19:54 - Vinay: I don't know the rodent / mammal that's on the bird
13 Mar 20:04 - Tegan: Internet says it's a weasel
13 Mar 20:04 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: Lol I was gona post that one
13 Mar 20:04 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: Woodpecker lived apparently
13 Mar 20:06 - Shaggy: It did live, I watched the interview with the guy that filmed it
13 Mar 20:06 - Shaggy: Or took a picture anyway
13 Mar 20:08 - Tegan: I watched an interview with the woodpecker
13 Mar 20:08 - Tegan: He was like, woooooaaaaah
13 Mar 20:09 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: The woodpecker?
13 Mar 20:09 - Shaggy: The weasel
13 Mar 20:11 - Vinay: Haha I thought you were going to say the same thing too, interview with the woodpecker
13 Mar 20:12 - Bongo: I wonder how many jokes have been made about riding a woodpecker after that picture was taken
13 Mar 20:13 - Vinay: http://cdn-test.healthunlocked.com/misc/sadie-breakfast-2015-03-13.gif

16 Mar 21:37 - Pete Morey: ... Or Republicans
16 Mar 21:38 - Pete Morey: 'another smelly poo has been voted in to the White house.'

20 Mar 09:37 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: Massive disappointment
20 Mar 09:37 - Krizia: Hahahahah nahhh a friend send that to me, nobody could see anything apparently. I missed it!
20 Mar 09:42 - Tegan: It's right now, I think
20 Mar 09:43 - Tegan: Main result is that it seems like a really shitty day
20 Mar 09:46 - Shaggy: It's on for another hour
20 Mar 09:46 - Shaggy: Looks no different to most other mornings
20 Mar 09:47 - Tegan: At least we won't go blind :)

20 Mar 09:49 - Tegan: Sell it to me!
20 Mar 09:50 - Henry Dranks: What this eclipse has taught me is that cloudy days are much darker than I thought

20 Mar 10:19 - Tegan: Beer
20 Mar 10:20 - Mike Joyce: I always drink bet on the pave....costs allot because i lose
20 Mar 10:22 - Tegan: Well exactly
20 Mar 10:22 - Tegan: But why pave extra for the pave to drink the costly bet?
20 Mar 10:22 - Tegan: That's what I'm asking
20 Mar 10:24 - Mike Joyce: I see your point but its all about the thrill of coins on concrete
20 Mar 10:24 - Shaggy: Beerfest to a pub is like a pub to a home.
20 Mar 10:25 - Tegan: Good start...
20 Mar 10:25 - Mike Joyce: Essential?

20 Mar 17:40 - Mike Joyce: I also fancy doing something!
20 Mar 17:41 - Tegan: Hooray for beer outside!
20 Mar 17:41 - Lorna: üåûüç∫üòÉ
20 Mar 17:41 - Tegan: Sun's going down imminently though
20 Mar 17:41 - Tegan: So might be wise to choose a beer garden perhaps

20 Mar 17:51 - Tegan: By which time bankers week likely to more of an issue than sunlight
20 Mar 17:51 - Tegan: Or at least, a more addressable issue
20 Mar 17:54 - Mike Joyce: How do you adress banker. ...sir or madam?    Crown and shuttle looks good but could that getting busy. Could head there. 40 mins is fine for me
20 Mar 17:55 - Mike Joyce: Everything descent will be busy anyway so no point worrying.

21 Mar 10:47 - Tegan: On a slightly more high brow note
21 Mar 10:48 - Tegan: Does anyone want to read Development as Freedom with us? We're planning a wee reading group
21 Mar 10:57 - Angela: I will!
21 Mar 11:01 - Angela: Not sure I can keep up with you though teegs, when are you reading it by?
21 Mar 11:03 - Tegan: Hoorah!

24 Mar 15:21 - Mike Joyce: I haven't even seen game of throwns but the "explain" cartoon made me laugh. It reminds me of something shaggy would say in real life
24 Mar 16:30 - Jimena: Its the stories of the lives and (mostly) deaths of the members of different clans in a medieval type fantasy world as they prepare for winter to come where winter lasts for years and years and brings with it deadly monsters and their ever growing army of undead.
24 Mar 16:32 - Jimena: And there's 3 dragons but they are kids and everyone is also waiting for them to grow and multiply.
24 Mar 16:32 - Mike Joyce: Sounds just like where i grew up

24 Mar 16:47 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: Apparently he lives in London as well, you should meet up!
24 Mar 16:48 - Krizia: Nooooo he is not that handsome as Sam!!!
24 Mar 16:48 - Krizia: üòçüòçüòçüòç
24 Mar 16:48 - Pete Morey: He certainly takes your breath away...
24 Mar 16:50 - Owen: He looks less like sam in that second photo and more like a young Robert deniro
24 Mar 16:53 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: <Media omitted>
24 Mar 17:08 - Sam Roberts: Too old
24 Mar 17:08 - Alex Bunn: Are you stalking him now Mike?
24 Mar 17:12 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: Any distraction will do today
24 Mar 17:13 - Mike Joyce: Definite love child
24 Mar 17:16 - Tegan: That was also my conclusion
24 Mar 17:16 - Tegan: Who is this lovechild and why do you have so many candid snaps of him?
24 Mar 17:17 - Sam Roberts: Cheers for clearing it up though, I spent ages trying to remember when I took that first one!
24 Mar 17:32 - Jimena: As someone who hasn't seen Sam in 7 years, the selfies made me think he wasn't aging so well üòÅ
24 Mar 17:43 - Mike Joyce: Ha ha
24 Mar 17:45 - Mike Joyce: Samad (Sam and Ahmad's love child) would be sadened by your comments

25 Mar 12:18 - Vanessa: Are they trying to do a world record on how many movies they can make on the same story?
25 Mar 12:19 - Alex Bunn: Fast and furious 6 was actually really good
25 Mar 12:19 - Alex Bunn: TIL there's a sharknado 3 and possibly a sharknado 4
25 Mar 12:24 - Vanessa: I don't even know what sharknado is
25 Mar 12:25 - Alex Bunn: Can you make a guess?
25 Mar 12:30 - Vanessa: I've just googled
25 Mar 12:30 - Vanessa: Seriously?! And it's 82% on rotten tomato
25 Mar 12:32 - Joe Jarman: I can't believe you had to google that to work out what it was about
25 Mar 12:32 - Joe Jarman: The title sharknado... Nuff said!!!!
25 Mar 12:36 - Joe Jarman: Whatsapp call feature is now working
25 Mar 12:45 - Tegan: It's just a cam through your carrier though
25 Mar 12:45 - Tegan: Call
25 Mar 12:45 - Tegan: Not over the Internet
25 Mar 12:49 - Joe Jarman: It's over the internet
25 Mar 12:49 - Joe Jarman: Not through your carrier
25 Mar 12:49 - Tegan: Must be an upgrade
25 Mar 12:50 - Joe Jarman: Yes
25 Mar 12:50 - Joe Jarman: There you go
25 Mar 12:50 - Joe Jarman: I called you from it
25 Mar 12:50 - Tegan: Got it :)
25 Mar 12:51 - Tegan: Poor old mobile network operators
25 Mar 12:52 - Joe Jarman: Next thing to get banned left right and centre...
25 Mar 12:52 - Joe Jarman: I can't see a reason to have minutes now on my ‚òé
25 Mar 12:53 - Tegan: But skype does this
25 Mar 12:53 - Tegan: And I still use minutes
25 Mar 12:55 - Joe Jarman: Skype doesn't have your entire phonebook loaded in with everyone constantly online
25 Mar 12:56 - Joe Jarman: You have to arrange a skype generally...
25 Mar 13:59 - Alex Bunn: Furure
25 Mar 13:59 - Alex Bunn: Future*
25 Mar 13:59 - Alex Bunn: Lol
25 Mar 15:02 - Alex Bunn: Mmm just got given a free donut from a random dude in the office
25 Mar 15:02 - Alex Bunn: He was walking round with a box of krispie kremes and was just handing them out
25 Mar 15:02 - Alex Bunn: Nom
25 Mar 15:02 - Henry Dranks: I just watched fast and furious 6 on your recommendation bunn, good call

25 Mar 15:04 - Henry Dranks: And that jump off the tank made me piss myself laughing
25 Mar 15:04 - Alex Bunn: Now watch sharknado 3
25 Mar 15:04 - Henry Dranks: Good plan
25 Mar 15:05 - Alex Bunn: And backdoor sluts 9
25 Mar 15:06 - Henry Dranks: Ill have to watch 1-8 first
25 Mar 15:08 - Alex Bunn: You dont have to
25 Mar 15:08 - Alex Bunn: But you can if you want
25 Mar 15:09 - Henry Dranks: What about sharknado 1-2
25 Mar 15:09 - Henry Dranks: Do I need them for plot points
25 Mar 15:09 - Henry Dranks: These are all important considerations
25 Mar 15:09 - Alex Bunn: Well you survived fast and furious 6 without fast and furious tokyo drift didnt you?
25 Mar 15:10 - Henry Dranks: Nah ive seen that!
25 Mar 15:10 - Alex Bunn: Lol of course!
25 Mar 15:10 - Henry Dranks: Was terrible tho
25 Mar 15:10 - Alex Bunn: Cos it didnt have the rock
25 Mar 15:11 - Henry Dranks: Yea pretty much
25 Mar 15:11 - Henry Dranks: His eyebrow acting is amazing
25 Mar 15:13 - Alex Bunn: <Media omitted>
25 Mar 15:13 - Alex Bunn: Damn straight
25 Mar 15:39 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: Jump off the tank was one of the greatest moments in cinema history
25 Mar 15:47 - Alex Bunn: I want to rewatch that film now
25 Mar 16:04 - Sam Roberts: I'm in, haven't seen any of them since the first one
25 Mar 16:04 - Sam Roberts: I hate to miss out on high culture!
25 Mar 16:36 - Alex Bunn: Sweeet
25 Mar 19:08 - Vanessa: I wish there was an emoticon that does eye roll
25 Mar 19:10 - Alex Bunn: üò±
25 Mar 19:58 - Mike Joyce: üé•=üöΩ?
25 Mar 19:59 - Mike Joyce: Actually I did not understand these films untill I was massively hung over...then they made pefect sence
25 Mar 20:01 - Shaggy: Woo my phone decided it can charge now
25 Mar 20:01 - Shaggy: Love the fat pics, bongo looks uncanny
26 Mar 08:51 - Shaggy: "Welcome back, Shaggy!"
26 Mar 08:51 - Shaggy: "Yay! he's back!"
26 Mar 08:51 - Shaggy: Aww so nice of you guys
26 Mar 08:57 - Tegan: I missed you Shaggy
26 Mar 09:29 - Joe Jarman: üéäüòâ
26 Mar 09:43 - Alex Bunn: Back to kill the convo flow
26 Mar 09:43 - Alex Bunn: üòâ
26 Mar 09:45 - Owen: I can't believe anyone is standing up for Clarkson. You don't get to punch a coworker over a cold steak just because you are famous for being a knob.
26 Mar 09:47 - Alex Bunn: I havnt heard anyone stand up for him
26 Mar 09:48 - Dave: I might stand up to piss on his car
26 Mar 09:48 - Dave: But i could do it sitting down
26 Mar 09:51 - Joe Jarman: Over one million people have signed his petition
26 Mar 09:52 - Joe Jarman: And his dinner was cold
26 Mar 09:52 - Joe Jarman: And the nobody producer was being an ass!!
26 Mar 10:10 - Shaggy: I like how James May put it - "much as I think he's a knob I quite like working with Jeremy"
26 Mar 10:12 - Sam Roberts: I can't believe you can be employed for being an entertaining prick for so long, then get suspended for being a prick
26 Mar 10:24 - Joe Jarman: It will ruin the show and itv will pick it up and it wil be really bad news for the bbc. One of the only shows left that anyone gives a fuck about overseas
26 Mar 10:34 - Owen: Doesn't mean you should be immune.
26 Mar 10:35 - Joe Jarman: But that's the reality
26 Mar 10:35 - Owen: The bbc still own the name. They will just find some new presenters.
26 Mar 10:35 - Joe Jarman: Top gear is nothing without Clarkson
26 Mar 10:36 - Owen: Jeremy Clarkson doesn't shit gold. He is just a balding middle aged white posh man with outdated opinions. It's not like Britain doesn't have loads of them lying about.
26 Mar 10:36 - Owen: You could get Nigel Farage to host the show and I wouldn't be able to tell the difference.
26 Mar 10:40 - Alex Bunn: Get rid
26 Mar 10:40 - Alex Bunn: He's a cunt
26 Mar 10:42 - Owen: Watch "Stewart Lee and Top Gear" on YouTube - Stewart Lee and Top Gear: https://youtu.be/K7CnMQ4L9Pc
26 Mar 10:42 - Joe Jarman: Well he has gone
26 Mar 10:42 - Shaggy: Top gear is dead
26 Mar 10:42 - Alex Bunn: They should replace top gear with a nice show about electric cars
26 Mar 10:42 - Joe Jarman: And top gear is dead
26 Mar 10:42 - Owen: I think stuart lee should take over
26 Mar 10:43 - Shaggy: Stuart lee is not funny
26 Mar 10:43 - Alex Bunn: Thats the point
26 Mar 10:44 - Joe Jarman: A show about electric cars mixed with a nice dose of political correctness
26 Mar 10:45 - Alex Bunn: Yep.
26 Mar 10:47 - Owen: Stuart lee is hilarious shaggy.
26 Mar 10:47 - Owen: Watch that video i just posted.
26 Mar 10:50 - Shaggy: Watched it yesterday. Not funny
26 Mar 10:50 - Alex Bunn: I dont see shaggy liking stewart lee
26 Mar 10:50 - Henry Dranks: I hate that video
26 Mar 10:50 - Alex Bunn: You have to be a miserable englishman to get him i think
26 Mar 10:50 - Owen: Do you think Jeremy Clarkson is funny then shags?
26 Mar 10:50 - Henry Dranks: And I agree that clarksons a cunt
26 Mar 10:51 - Henry Dranks: But that lee video is unfunny and ridiculously far off the mark about top gear
26 Mar 10:51 - Henry Dranks: And every one posts it everywhere like its some heavenly takedown of top gear
26 Mar 10:51 - Henry Dranks: Its fucking not!
26 Mar 10:51 - Alex Bunn: Is it the one about the playground bully?
26 Mar 10:52 - Owen: No its the one about wishing Hammond had died in that crash. But its only a joke, you know, like on top gear.
26 Mar 10:53 - Alex Bunn: Oh i get it
26 Mar 10:53 - Alex Bunn: I get jokes
26 Mar 10:53 - Shaggy: I think clarkson is funny, on the show. I don't think he is a nice person irl and his being fired is the correct thing to do, but it still ruins the show
26 Mar 10:53 - Alex Bunn: The show was a parody of itself by now
26 Mar 10:54 - Alex Bunn: I honestly couldnt tell if it was a new one or a rerun now
26 Mar 10:54 - Alex Bunn: The same shit again and again
26 Mar 10:56 - Angela: Alan partridge should be the new presenter
26 Mar 10:56 - Shaggy: It would be a different show entirely, but I c
26 Mar 10:56 - Shaggy: Condone this
26 Mar 10:58 - Owen: I just don't get why anyone finds an ignorant old man who should know better funny. His "jokes" literally consist of asian peoples eyes are slanted and post colonial Britain has a derogatory term for that; the term "slope." You know what else has slopes? Bridges do. Oh look a bridge with an Asian person on it. Wow! Slope on a slope! Hahahahahahahaha! Slope! Slopey slope slope slop! Hahahahaha, nudge nudge wink wink, were all thinking it aren't we middle Britain. Slope. Ha! 


Well no Jeremy, I'm not thinking that. All you have done is said "there is a person on a bridge" but somehow you have managed to do so in the most casually racist way possible.
26 Mar 10:58 - Alex Bunn: Yeah Alan Partridge!
26 Mar 10:59 - Alex Bunn: Its almost the same as clarkson but we can laugh at it
26 Mar 10:59 - Owen: Yeah because its a character. Not just a racist guy.
26 Mar 11:00 - Alex Bunn: Clarkson should have made an alter ego for the show and then he wouldnt be in half as much shit
26 Mar 11:00 - Owen: Totally.
26 Mar 11:00 - Shaggy: I think old racist people a funny because they are so clueless. In juxtaposition to him you had calm and collected may, and adorable hamster.
26 Mar 11:00 - Alex Bunn: That'd be using the ol noodle
26 Mar 11:01 - Owen: Problem is that Clarkson isn't clueless.
26 Mar 11:01 - Owen: A 90 yr old granma from rotherham is funny because she is clueless.
26 Mar 11:02 - Henry Dranks: Not clueless but he is a fossil
26 Mar 11:02 - Henry Dranks: My mums bf is like him
26 Mar 11:02 - Henry Dranks: Its not cluelessness they just dint understand modern views
26 Mar 11:02 - Henry Dranks: Or why its a problem
26 Mar 11:02 - Alex Bunn: They should get a 'toad of toad hall' charcter from wind in the willows to present
26 Mar 11:02 - Owen: Clarkson is 50 something, went to private school and probably has family money from colonialism knocking about.  His views don't come from cluelessness, his view
26 Mar 11:03 - Owen: Views come from a much more insidious place.
26 Mar 11:03 - Alex Bunn: Tim nice but dim. But with cars
26 Mar 11:03 - Alex Bunn: I'd watch that
26 Mar 11:03 - Alex Bunn: For a bit
26 Mar 11:04 - Alex Bunn: Boris! Haha
26 Mar 11:04 - Alex Bunn: Keeps him away from politics
26 Mar 11:04 - Owen: Steve coogan and rob brydon would be a good combo.
26 Mar 11:04 - Alex Bunn: Oooh yeah
26 Mar 11:04 - Owen: Also i think coogan is actually really into cars
26 Mar 11:05 - Alex Bunn: And brydon clearly isnt. It'd be hilarious
26 Mar 11:05 - Owen: Yeah. And they already have great chemistry. Have you seen the trip?
26 Mar 11:06 - Alex Bunn: Yeah of course. Thats why i'm so behind this idea
26 Mar 11:06 - Owen: Does there need to be a third?
26 Mar 11:06 - Eliza: And they'd spend half the time trying to do the best clarkson impression anyway!
26 Mar 11:06 - Owen: Hahahahha
26 Mar 11:07 - Angela: Hammond isn't a hamster he's a sheep. With his head far up clarksons arse
26 Mar 11:07 - Owen: Which would allow them to keep the casual racism that has made top gear so popular
26 Mar 11:11 - Alex Bunn: I thought it was about cars? Haha
26 Mar 11:11 - Alex Bunn: Ohohohohoho
26 Mar 11:13 - Owen: Nope. Otherwise fith gear would be popular
26 Mar 11:13 - Alex Bunn: Yeah or any other car show!
26 Mar 11:13 - Alex Bunn: How about cars and....
26 Mar 11:13 - Alex Bunn: Wait for it
26 Mar 11:14 - Alex Bunn: .... Guns
26 Mar 11:14 - Alex Bunn: I'm talking fast and furious 6
26 Mar 11:14 - Alex Bunn: With the rock
26 Mar 11:14 - Alex Bunn: Yes i watched it again last night
26 Mar 11:15 - Owen: Ok its settled. The new top gear cast is: steve coogan, rob brydon and dwayne "the rock" johnson
26 Mar 11:15 - Alex Bunn: We have a winner
26 Mar 11:17 - Henry Dranks: Haha good work bunn
26 Mar 11:17 - Henry Dranks: That film was instant classic
26 Mar 11:18 - Alex Bunn: Thanks üëç
26 Mar 11:18 - Alex Bunn: How was the sharknado trilogy?
26 Mar 11:19 - Henry Dranks: I didnt get onto it my internet died :(
26 Mar 11:20 - Alex Bunn: How terrible!
26 Mar 11:20 - Henry Dranks: Truly it was the darkest of times
26 Mar 11:22 - Alex Bunn: Are you still ill?
26 Mar 11:22 - Alex Bunn: Or have you managed to go to work?
26 Mar 11:22 - Alex Bunn: Where, conveniently, the internet works
26 Mar 11:27 - Henry Dranks: Haha

26 Mar 11:28 - Alex Bunn: Oh god. I can tell you the rio stories
26 Mar 11:28 - Alex Bunn: And tom can tell us how he ended up in thai prison for a week
26 Mar 11:28 - Henry Dranks: Yes!
26 Mar 11:29 - Henry Dranks: All things I want to hear
26 Mar 11:33 - Owen: <Media omitted>
26 Mar 11:33 - Owen: Worst mark scheme ever!
26 Mar 11:33 - Owen: They might as well write "pupil has put the correct answer down"
26 Mar 11:35 - Henry Dranks: #teacherproblems
26 Mar 11:36 - Owen: This is a proper exam. It affects these pupil's GCSE results. And they give me this vague bullshit markscheme. #fuckAQA
26 Mar 11:36 - Henry Dranks: What was the question?
26 Mar 11:36 - Alex Bunn: Be a nice teacher and give them all their GCES
26 Mar 11:37 - Owen: It gets moderated. Otherwise i would, the mark scheme is vague enough that it wouldn't even feel unprofessional to do so.
26 Mar 11:38 - Owen: @henry: the question was "why might someone else not get the same results as you"
26 Mar 11:39 - Henry Dranks: Doesnt sound like a particularly well set question
26 Mar 11:45 - Owen: It's a crock of shit, the whole paper is!
26 Mar 11:46 - Alex Bunn: OWEN RAMPAGE
26 Mar 11:49 - Owen: The paper doesn't test the kids. It tests the teacher's understanding of game theory . So much is left up to my discretion, but thats the same accross the country. So I have to mark bearing in mind that other teachers across the country will probably be lenient because they can be and because they are probably basing their marking on the idea that other teachers will be lenient. But I have to balance that with the fact that the papers get moderated. It's a fucking nightmare, just give me a mark scheme that says: "this is right, this is wrong"
26 Mar 11:51 - Dave: Mark it zero dude
26 Mar 11:52 - Alex Bunn: Lol
26 Mar 12:16 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: '156 messages from 2 conversations'

26 Mar 12:19 - Henry Dranks: Is it a parody?
26 Mar 12:59 - Shaggy: Teachers aren't what they used to be, they want answers given on a plate to them these days
26 Mar 13:01 - Owen: On marks schemes. Yes
26 Mar 18:40 - Owen: Henry:

"The Bible clearly states that the sky is a solid dome, a "firmament," which was firm enough to separate waters above it from those below on the Earth. By Noah's time it was still solid enough to have windows in it that had to be opened to let the rain through. I think that false-Christians that spite on God's face by calling it "poetic metaphor" have given in to the godless materialists! The Bible really is literal, in the true sense of the word. The sky was a hard firmament with windows in it-and anybody who says different is a mealy-mouthed evolution-sympathizer. "

Almost certainly a  parody.
26 Mar 18:40 - Owen: Also:

"Evolutionists want to call those piddlin' changes "evolution"--which just shows that they don't even know what the term means. So we creationists have to tell them that "evolution" means apes popping out human babies. You'd think them evil-utionists'd have that straight by now."
26 Mar 18:40 - Henry Dranks: But...read the replies
26 Mar 18:40 - Owen: A parody. But a hilarious one.
26 Mar 18:41 - Henry Dranks: Its a very well done parody
26 Mar 18:41 - Owen: Oooo. There's replies. I haven't get there yet
26 Mar 18:41 - Henry Dranks: I thought it was a parody
26 Mar 18:41 - Henry Dranks: Then I read the replies
26 Mar 18:41 - Henry Dranks: And now I think it might be real
26 Mar 18:41 - Henry Dranks: I just dont know what to believe anymore :(
26 Mar 18:42 - Shaggy: Can you believe it's not butter?
26 Mar 18:42 - Henry Dranks: I...I just dont know
26 Mar 18:43 - Mike Joyce: Can you belive its not god butter?
26 Mar 18:43 - Henry Dranks: What would god butter even entail?
26 Mar 18:43 - Shaggy: Gutter
26 Mar 18:44 - Mike Joyce: Just apppy liberally to life form
26 Mar 18:44 - Shaggy: Intellectual gutter anyhow
26 Mar 18:44 - Mike Joyce: Evolution occurs

26 Mar 18:45 - Mike Joyce: We all contain gods butter
26 Mar 18:46 - Mike Joyce: I always fins it most amusing that thses bloggers are using a computer
26 Mar 18:47 - Mike Joyce: The same disaplin of logical deduction goes into the design of a computer is simply applied to fossel records
26 Mar 18:47 - Shaggy: Yes. At least Amish keep it real
26 Mar 18:47 - Mike Joyce: Respect the aimish
26 Mar 18:48 - Mike Joyce: But then its like...now your pretending the modern world dosnt exist

26 Mar 18:49 - Owen: I am pretty sure it is just loads of trolls trolling each other.
26 Mar 18:50 - Mike Joyce: im talking in general terms
26 Mar 18:51 - Shaggy: Speaking of trolls, here's an interesting article http://www.rferl.mobi/a/how-to-guide-russian-trolling-trolls/26919999.html
26 Mar 18:53 - Mike Joyce: Holly shit
26 Mar 18:53 - Mike Joyce: Unsuprised but saddened
26 Mar 18:56 - Owen: Wow. I wonder if that happens at all in britain or America
26 Mar 18:57 - Mike Joyce: Probably. ..Certainly the latter
26 Mar 18:57 - Mike Joyce: I bet private companies
26 Mar 18:58 - Shaggy: I was wondering the same, but I think it's less likely to happen politically, at least in such a way
26 Mar 18:58 - Shaggy: I mean Fox News is pretty much that, but it's more official
26 Mar 19:00 - Mike Joyce: Yes i guess russia only really has one party of strength
26 Mar 19:01 - Mike Joyce: It would be like fox news if all democrats were gone
26 Mar 19:02 - Owen: Whelp, looks like I'm having nightmares tonight.
26 Mar 19:14 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: Tl;dr for today's Horde chat?

2 Apr 14:19 - Bongo: Election debate?

2 Apr 14:20 - Dave: How about 7 pigs?
2 Apr 14:20 - Alex Bunn: I lol'd
2 Apr 14:21 - Bongo: 7 is probably crossing the line
2 Apr 14:21 - Bongo: I can't stand they way they talk during debates though
2 Apr 14:22 - Bongo: They need to figure things out battle royale style
2 Apr 14:27 - Dave: That would make voting simpler
2 Apr 14:27 - Dave: If the opposition are all dead
2 Apr 14:28 - Shaggy: Arnie as prime minister, I like it

2 Apr 18:54 - Alex Bunn: 8
2 Apr 18:54 - Alex Bunn: Maybe 9
2 Apr 18:54 - Alex Bunn: #drinking
2 Apr 19:53 - Sam Roberts: Fishing's one of the great British past times of yore, like cricket
2 Apr 19:54 - Sam Roberts: They both don't make a lot of sense until you realise that holding a beer doesn't get in the way of either
2 Apr 19:54 - Sam Roberts: Can't wait
2 Apr 19:55 - Shaggy: Cricket is a lot more boring
2 Apr 20:01 - Joe Jarman: Daaaave

2 Apr 21:00 - Hannah Murphy: Especially Ukrainians
2 Apr 21:02 - Shaggy: üòî
2 Apr 21:04 - Hannah Murphy: Ugh he is the worst
2 Apr 21:34 - Sam Roberts: I caught about five seconds of Farage talking and it made my skin crawl
2 Apr 21:34 - Sam Roberts: I'm saying it, televised debates are bad for democracy
2 Apr 21:35 - Sam Roberts: They accentuate everything bad with the system while giving no accurate information to the people that need or want it
2 Apr 21:36 - Dave: I like nicola sturgeon. Damn not being scotish
2 Apr 21:39 - Alex Bunn: Mud wrestling round next
2 Apr 21:39 - Hannah Murphy: This really reminds me of the weakest link
2 Apr 21:39 - Hannah Murphy: That presenter woman as Ann Robinson

2 Apr 21:42 - Hannah Murphy: Also when the camera pans back to the girl who asked the question, check out the moustache on the guy two seats to the left
2 Apr 21:43 - Dave: It's amazing
2 Apr 21:43 - Dave: Hope he has a question
2 Apr 22:14 - Hannah Murphy: <Media omitted>
2 Apr 22:15 - Shaggy: Wow that's impressive
2 Apr 23:23 - Owen: I wish fact checking happened in real time.
2 Apr 23:23 - Owen: That would change everything
2 Apr 23:24 - Dave: Yeah, and there was a claxon every time someone was inaccurate
2 Apr 23:24 - Dave: It would just be a constant alarm for 2 hours
2 Apr 23:24 - Joe Jarman: <Media omitted>
2 Apr 23:24 - Owen: And a dong everytime someone made a promise they couldn't keep.
2 Apr 23:25 - Owen: Oh wait that already exists.... Cameron.
2 Apr 23:31 - Dave: Milliband's performance has made me wonder abour voting labour.
2 Apr 23:31 - Dave: He couldn't stand up to the real points about past labour
2 Apr 23:32 - Dave: As in, PFI in the NHS, not the whole labour recked the economy crap
2 Apr 23:33 - Dave: The nationalists (not inc UKIP) had the strongest message for me but it's useless for an English voter
2 Apr 23:33 - Dave: Doh
2 Apr 23:36 - Dave: There endeth the bantz
2 Apr 23:52 - Dave: Turns out the aids thing wasn't a new low for farage
2 Apr 23:52 - Dave: http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/oct/10/nigel-farage-keep-hiv-positive-migrants-out-britain

3 Apr 17:36 - Tegan: Mile End
3 Apr 17:36 - Tegan: Heading over yours ways at some points. ..
3 Apr 17:36 - Vanessa: When are you going to be at ctown?
3 Apr 17:40 - Tegan: Setting off now. ..
3 Apr 17:40 - Tegan: Maybe 40 mins?
3 Apr 17:40 - Vanessa: Cool
3 Apr 17:40 - Vanessa: It's all ready to hit play
3 Apr 17:45 - Tegan: Whoop!
3 Apr 18:53 - Bongo: I've just been getting into Stewart lee
3 Apr 18:53 - Bongo: That guy is funny
3 Apr 19:11 - Shaggy: That means you're getting old
3 Apr 19:19 - Owen: No. It means he has a sense of humour that doesn't revolve around farting in a cockney accent.
3 Apr 19:29 - Bongo: He has this ridiculously long but about ukip that's hilarious
3 Apr 19:30 - Tegan: He is great at ridiculously long bits
3 Apr 19:30 - Tegan: Shaggy doesn't get it for some reason
3 Apr 19:43 - Owen: Coz shaggy only understands the humour of long russian winters; not long british rants.
3 Apr 19:44 - Alex Bunn: Yeah i think thats it
3 Apr 19:45 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: He does less protracted rants now to be fair
3 Apr 19:46 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: I was never really that into them
3 Apr 19:53 - Owen: I love him. He is the kind of funny i wish i could be. Silly and dry at the same time is so hard to pull of.
3 Apr 19:53 - Owen: Off*
3 Apr 19:54 - Tegan: Theatre, innit
3 Apr 19:54 - Owen: Down by the corn exchange.
3 Apr 19:54 - Tegan: Right
3 Apr 20:06 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: I like him a lot, but I've always thought his repetition comedy was weak
3 Apr 20:07 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: Like the one where he's talking about the taxi driver who says you'll get locked in prison for saying you're english
3 Apr 20:07 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: It doesn't make me laugh
3 Apr 20:08 - Tegan: It goes through being weak into being funny again
3 Apr 20:08 - Tegan: That's the joy
3 Apr 20:08 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: But it's kind of cheap, you know?
3 Apr 20:09 - Tegan: After reading that book I feel like he's just messing with people
3 Apr 20:10 - Tegan: I can understand why you wouldn't enjoy it
3 Apr 20:10 - Alex Bunn: Shouldnt you be drunk mike?
3 Apr 20:11 - Alex Bunn: Get back to drinking! üçª
3 Apr 20:48 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: <Media omitted>
3 Apr 21:26 - Bongo: Good Viking look shags
3 Apr 21:50 - Vanessa: What's the singers name in Nickelback?
3 Apr 21:53 - Shaggy: Bongo
3 Apr 23:15 - Joe Jarman: Chad Kroeger
3 Apr 23:15 - Joe Jarman: Or something
3 Apr 23:17 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: Adolf Hitler I think
4 Apr 09:31 - Shaggy: My problem with Stewart lee is that his humour is just really drawn out. He says something remotely funny and then clings to it for half an hour, I find it tedious. He is the exact opposite of Mitch hedberg, who was all about punchlines. He is just a really clever guy who slightly misinterpreted humour and made a career out of it. Or is making fun out of humour.
4 Apr 09:37 - Tegan: Makes me chuckle.  Mitch Hedberg is all about words, but Stewart Lee does a lot more than that - he uses patterns and devices a lot more.
4 Apr 09:37 - Tegan: I think it's much more interesting than what a lot of comedians do
4 Apr 09:39 - Shaggy: I can see why people find him funny, I think he would be excellent beer comrade, I'm just not into his monologues
4 Apr 09:40 - Alex Bunn: I have grown into it
4 Apr 09:41 - Shaggy: And I got used to living with mould in my room.
4 Apr 10:16 - Bongo: Dogs are always in the push-up position
4 Apr 10:16 - Bongo: Classic
4 Apr 10:17 - Bongo: Agree with tegs though Stewart lee is specifically coming from a different angle
4 Apr 12:37 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: Shaggy check out Dan Mintz on youtube
4 Apr 12:37 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: He voices Tina on Bob's Burgers, quite Mitch Hedburgish
4 Apr 12:38 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: Partly it's just funny seeing that voice come out of that face
4 Apr 13:03 - Alex Bunn: Whatup gang. Meeting craig and hayley and otherss for drinks in angel later
4 Apr 13:03 - Alex Bunn: Consider initation extended
4 Apr 13:03 - Alex Bunn: Invitation*
4 Apr 13:05 - Bongo: Awesome, I might join you guys
4 Apr 13:07 - Tegan: Sounds good
4 Apr 13:08 - Tegan: Important but unrelated question:

4 Apr 13:08 - Tegan: What should they call it?
4 Apr 13:09 - Bongo: Pornotron
4 Apr 13:10 - Shaggy: PornHAL
4 Apr 13:12 - Bongo: It'll be run by ed balls right?
4 Apr 13:12 - Bongo: Balls deep
4 Apr 13:30 - Tegan: I was going down the COM root
4 Apr 13:31 - Tegan: Jerk-off-com?
4 Apr 13:33 - Bongo: Cockblockdotcom
4 Apr 13:35 - Alex Bunn: Pornop
4 Apr 13:35 - Alex Bunn: Pornope*
4 Apr 13:44 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: Spank bank of England
4 Apr 13:45 - Bongo: Ministry of chastity belts
4 Apr 13:54 - Alex Bunn: Labour of love

4 Apr 14:02 - Tegan: Thanks all- some good thoughts
4 Apr 14:03 - Shaggy: I can't believe there aren't better things to work on
4 Apr 14:04 - Owen: But a kid might see a woman urinate shaggy. Think of the children. Is no one thinking of the children
4 Apr 14:04 - Shaggy: This country is teeming with immigrants and they want to deny us basic human rights
4 Apr 14:05 - Owen: I think shaggy might be voting UKIP guys...
4 Apr 14:05 - Bongo: Yea they looking at it all wrong, they need to integrate education into it
4 Apr 14:05 - Owen: Shotgun teaching that lesson!
4 Apr 14:06 - Bongo: If 3 swingers and 4 couples go to an orgy, how many people were having sex?
4 Apr 14:06 - Owen: I'm perfect for the job. Not only have i had 5 years teaching experience, I also have an encyclopedic knowledge of porn.
4 Apr 14:06 - Owen: 11!
4 Apr 14:07 - Owen: Boom see!
4 Apr 14:07 - Owen: Perfect for the job.
4 Apr 14:07 - Shaggy: For the blow job
4 Apr 14:07 - Bongo: Ahh but I didn't say how many people just wanted to go to watch
4 Apr 14:07 - Bongo: Or how many animals there were
4 Apr 14:09 - Owen: It's a swingers party not a United kingdom independence party.
4 Apr 14:10 - Shaggy: Are they british animals?
4 Apr 15:10 - Jimena: And does sex with oneself count?
4 Apr 15:10 - Jimena: If so, at which point does it count as sex? What are the requirements?
4 Apr 15:11 - Jimena: In fact what are the running sex criteria? A teacher must anticipate such questions
4 Apr 15:20 - Jimena: <Media omitted>
4 Apr 15:20 - Jimena: Frankenplughole
4 Apr 15:29 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: That sounds like a gross sex position

5 Apr 12:15 - Tegan: I'm going to eat too much chocolate
5 Apr 12:15 - Tegan: Up for popping round for movies later though
5 Apr 12:18 - Bongo: Shags your pc is massively freaking me out
5 Apr 12:18 - Bongo: It's doing this weird word replace
5 Apr 12:19 - Bongo: All instances of the word force are being replaced with horse
5 Apr 12:19 - Bongo: Election debate is being replaced by "eating contest"
5 Apr 12:19 - Bongo: I'm too hungover to deal with this!!
5 Apr 12:25 - Tegan: Lol
5 Apr 12:26 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: Haha
5 Apr 12:34 - Shaggy: Oh my god it took you two months to realise!
5 Apr 15:37 - Tegan: <Media omitted>

5 Apr 16:21 - Shaggy: Hehe yes
5 Apr 16:23 - Shaggy: If you're attempting to summon me though, this time you were unsuccessful

6 Apr 13:50 - Hannah Murphy: Bahahahah
6 Apr 14:04 - Joe Jarman: Lol
6 Apr 14:17 - Owen: Just watched the debates. Right. Thats it. I'm voting UKIP. Can't have these foreign homos coming over here with all their super AIDS! Spreading all their super AIDS on all the surfaces. Foreign homos, with thier super AIDS get 'em out. Send 'em back to homoland with their super AIDS  let them rot in homoland! If they have the audacity to be born in a country without a good healthcare system and an AIDS epidemic let them homo rot in their homo super AIDS. The frogman has spoken.

6 Apr 19:21 - Tegan: I didn't leave my phone in c town
6 Apr 19:21 - Tegan: I left it in my coat pocket
6 Apr 19:23 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: üëç
7 Apr 18:37 - Mike Joyce: Phone broken for a few days....384 messages from the hoard.....your slipping guys....bongo had twice that!!
7 Apr 19:25 - Shaggy: His was broken for over a week to be fair. And if anything it just shows much you're a part of this
7 Apr 20:55 - Mike Joyce: Ok good. Will read back when i have a free few hours. :
7 Apr 21:02 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: <Media omitted>
7 Apr 21:03 - Mike Joyce: Looks like a fusion bbq
7 Apr 21:21 - Sam Roberts: Big meat is coming
7 Apr 21:24 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: <Media omitted>
7 Apr 22:33 - Martha: Wait, when?? Have I missed it?
7 Apr 22:34 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: Just a dress rehearsal
8 Apr 10:06 - Jimena: Is sam wearing a onesie in that picture?
8 Apr 10:08 - Jimena: Or a robe? And by robe i really mean dress.
8 Apr 10:09 - Dave: I think you got in the first time. It's a onesie loving house
8 Apr 10:10 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: He's probably wearing it as we speak
8 Apr 10:22 - Sam Roberts: You caught my bad side
8 Apr 10:22 - Sam Roberts: The one without a tail
8 Apr 10:22 - Sam Roberts: Great bbq everyone who came
8 Apr 10:23 - Sam Roberts: Everyone who didn't, that was just the warm up for big meat Monday
8 Apr 10:23 - Sam Roberts: All welcome, bring meat!!!
8 Apr 10:48 - Pete Morey: Wha?!  When does it commence?!
8 Apr 10:48 - Pete Morey: I'll bring mead of honey dew and a fine hock
8 Apr 10:49 - Pete Morey: Plus bacon,  black.
8 Apr 14:07 - Jimena: Lol. I didnt know onesies were back. Although i know they are very popular in australia
8 Apr 14:11 - Jimena: <Media omitted>
8 Apr 14:11 - Jimena: Good friend of mine went through a onesie modelling phase
8 Apr 14:12 - Shaggy: Australia's climate is not great for onesies
8 Apr 14:12 - Jimena: <Media omitted>
8 Apr 14:13 - Jimena: Maybe they are in a different material..
8 Apr 14:15 - Jimena: http://www.onesiestore.com.au/shop/animal-onesies
8 Apr 14:22 - Shaggy: Nah they is the same what we have http://www.kigu.co.uk
8 Apr 14:25 - Krizia: I really don't get the popularity of kigus!! Why would you want to dress up as a fat and big animal?
8 Apr 14:26 - Krizia: Specially in Australia!  Whyyyyy would you use one in the beach! !!üò©
8 Apr 14:26 - Krizia: Whyyyyy! !!!
8 Apr 14:26 - Krizia: :p
8 Apr 14:46 - Shaggy: Fat is the new black
8 Apr 14:46 - Shaggy: And animals were always sexy
8 Apr 14:48 - Krizia: Mmmmmmm no
8 Apr 14:53 - Vanessa: I agree with Krizia
8 Apr 14:55 - Shaggy: <Media omitted>
8 Apr 15:04 - Jimena: Are you ladies not familiar with 'fat pants'?
8 Apr 15:05 - Jimena: I.e. Stretchy loose clothes you can comfortably binge in?
8 Apr 15:07 - Jimena: Two: a onesie is much like a blankie that hugs all your body at once.
8 Apr 15:11 - Sam Roberts: Great points Jimena
8 Apr 15:11 - Sam Roberts: it's also impossible to be unhappy in a onesie
8 Apr 15:20 - Tegan: I think that is probably true
8 Apr 15:20 - Tegan: I am remembering how happy Shaggy was as the marshmallow dude from ghostbusters
8 Apr 15:23 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: <Media omitted>
8 Apr 15:24 - Shaggy: Cananabananalism
8 Apr 15:41 - Tegan: Yaaaaaay!!
8 Apr 16:53 - Krizia: Jajajajajajjsjs
8 Apr 16:53 - Krizia: Better to be gigant fruits
8 Apr 16:53 - Krizia: Jhjajajajjajaja
8 Apr 17:01 - Krizia: Than animals
8 Apr 17:01 - Krizia: Ajjajaj
8 Apr 17:27 - Shaggy: Like a giant butternut squash
8 Apr 17:27 - Shaggy: Or a cashew
9 Apr 00:00 - Jimena: <Media omitted>
9 Apr 08:31 - Shaggy: They're not wrong
9 Apr 08:32 - Tegan: no, they are wrong
9 Apr 08:33 - Tegan: It's more like the answer to 'what ended at the onset of 1896?'
9 Apr 08:38 - Hannah Murphy: Harsh Tegan, harsh
9 Apr 08:59 - Shaggy: Pedant
9 Apr 09:02 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: Lol I was gona say that too Tegan, but didn't want to be the smartass
9 Apr 09:03 - Dave: Half marks
9 Apr 09:03 - Shaggy: Sounds like you have the grumps again. Get some coffee
9 Apr 09:05 - Sam Roberts: Shaggy calling Tegan a pedant? What is this, opposite day?
9 Apr 09:05 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: To be fair, that kid was trying to be a smartass, gotta get it right
9 Apr 09:05 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: Like Muphries law
9 Apr 09:05 - Shaggy: Muffries
9 Apr 09:10 - Henry Dranks: Surely it can end in 1896 because it doesnt end simultaneously around the world
9 Apr 09:10 - Henry Dranks: Some bits of the world are un 1896 while others still in 1895
9 Apr 09:22 - Tegan: I'm with Mike
9 Apr 09:22 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: True, but you can't say we're 'in' Wednesday because it is in Hawaii
9 Apr 09:23 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: Its mutually exclusive for each time zone
9 Apr 09:24 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: I can see this being one of those "oh my god, 136 messages from the Horde, wtf" arguments, so I'm going to take a step back now
9 Apr 10:01 - Henry Dranks: Haha wheres the fun in that
9 Apr 10:11 - Alex Bunn: Boring!
9 Apr 10:17 - Krizia: <Media omitted>
9 Apr 10:17 - Krizia: Hawaiii
9 Apr 10:17 - Krizia: Sorry guys that's the only thing I got from the conversation
9 Apr 10:18 - Krizia: :)
9 Apr 11:22 - Jimena: I personally think that any valid answer should be accepted as its the person writing the exams job to word thinks clearly. Teacher might also want to give a lesson on deducing what kind of answer is expected given a context.
9 Apr 11:25 - Jimena: Finally i agree w tegan and mike that as the answer given was actually not valid that should be pointed out to the kid. Whether kid wants to be a smartass or not he should make sure his answer is valid.
9 Apr 11:26 - Jimena: I have been humbled a few times by little kids outsmarting me. For example one time kids were really noisy and i yelled and asked if they could hear me. A little 4 year old said to me:
9 Apr 11:26 - Jimena: Of course i can hear you. I have ears.
9 Apr 11:27 - Jimena: So i never asked things in that way again.
9 Apr 11:30 - Jimena: Another time i told kids off for telling each other off. I said 'I'M the police'. And a 6 or 7 year old said 'no, the POLICE is the police.' So i had to rephrase things differently
9 Apr 11:31 - Jimena: Btw the example before came from an Indian friend
9 Apr 11:31 - Jimena: (The one in the photo)
9 Apr 11:32 - Vanessa: Not everyone with ears can hear
9 Apr 11:32 - Vanessa: That's what I would have told the kid
9 Apr 11:32 - Jimena: Lol. She was 4. But touch√©.
9 Apr 11:33 - Jimena: <Media omitted>
9 Apr 11:33 - Shaggy: Lol
9 Apr 11:34 - Shaggy: Freddie, johny, ...
9 Apr 11:34 - Tegan: Now that's some quality wisecracking
9 Apr 11:38 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: <Media omitted>
9 Apr 12:25 - Sam Roberts: I'm just signing up to do a mud run with a chap from work anyone fancy it?
9 Apr 12:25 - Sam Roberts: 12k jog with a few obstacles and stuff
9 Apr 12:26 - Alex Bunn: I bet its one of those tough mudder things!
9 Apr 12:27 - Alex Bunn: I'm keen depending in dates
9 Apr 12:27 - Sam Roberts: No electrocution though!
9 Apr 12:29 - Sam Roberts: http://www.back2thetrenches.co.uk/events.php#.VQKwc0Jcfds
9 Apr 12:29 - Sam Roberts: I'm signing up for the June run just now
9 Apr 12:33 - Vanessa: I'd be in but can't do June, perhaps the Sept one
9 Apr 12:55 - Bongo: How much is it?
9 Apr 12:55 - Bongo: I love the sound of everything except the jogging
9 Apr 12:56 - Bongo: If there's a shop mobility lane inbetween obstacles I'm in
9 Apr 13:01 - Joe Jarman: <Media omitted>
9 Apr 13:02 - Bongo: Sigkt?
9 Apr 13:02 - Tegan: First, master the use of basic grammar
9 Apr 13:03 - Tegan: Then discuss human rights
9 Apr 13:03 - Tegan: 's Maslow, innit
9 Apr 13:07 - Joe Jarman: Fight!
9 Apr 13:48 - Alex Bunn: Harry has some beef
9 Apr 14:07 - Owen: I am not sure anyone has the right to fight anyone else. Harry seems to think girls have fighting rights, i am pretty sure they don't; unless there is some blasted EU regulation, get Britain out so boys can punch girls again.
9 Apr 14:20 - Tegan: agreed
9 Apr 14:20 - Tegan: no
9 Apr 14:20 - Tegan: wait..
9 Apr 15:15 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: Do you have the right to fight for your right to party?
9 Apr 15:50 - Bongo: Let's just agree to party
9 Apr 17:13 - Vanessa: Is someone going to be in ctown around 6:30pmish?

9 Apr 17:39 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: Promise I won't spam this group like he spams fb!
9 Apr 17:42 - Angela: Is the paperclip club some kind of biker gang?
9 Apr 17:56 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: Its his old graffiti moniker for reasons long forgotten
9 Apr 17:57 - Sam Roberts: Get me a wings one pls
9 Apr 17:57 - Sam Roberts: I'm good for it, I swear
9 Apr 17:58 - Tegan: are they soft?

9 Apr 18:09 - Joe Jarman: Yeah I could go for a beer
9 Apr 18:09 - Joe Jarman: I'm in the wharf atm. Just about to leave
9 Apr 18:10 - Shaggy: Hmm I guess cat and canary has a nice outside bit
9 Apr 18:10 - Joe Jarman: Are you far?
9 Apr 18:10 - Shaggy: At work
9 Apr 18:11 - Joe Jarman: You wanna come here then?
9 Apr 18:11 - Shaggy: I haven't quite finish, I could aim for 7
9 Apr 18:18 - Joe Jarman: I wonder if Dave is here
9 Apr 18:22 - Joe Jarman: I could come towards you mate tbh
9 Apr 18:22 - Joe Jarman: I could do with getting out of east London
9 Apr 18:24 - Shaggy: Huge
9 Apr 18:24 - Shaggy: Hehe
9 Apr 18:24 - Shaggy: In that case the George is nice and near the station
9 Apr 18:25 - Joe Jarman: London bridge?
9 Apr 18:25 - Shaggy: Yup
9 Apr 18:26 - Joe Jarman: Ok
9 Apr 18:28 - Shaggy: Sweet
9 Apr 18:28 - Shaggy: I'll be waiting with a beer for you
9 Apr 18:38 - Joe Jarman: Sounds like a good deal üëç
9 Apr 18:42 - Joe Jarman: You here yet?
9 Apr 18:44 - Shaggy: Locking up at work
9 Apr 18:51 - Joe Jarman: What do you want
9 Apr 18:53 - Mateusz: George?

9 Apr 19:16 - Lorna: Faltering fullback?...
10 Apr 14:38 - Bongo: Anyone know a good organiser app
10 Apr 14:38 - Bongo: Like outlook does with meetings
10 Apr 14:39 - Tegan: Google?
10 Apr 14:41 - Bongo: Yea cool
10 Apr 14:41 - Bongo: I should always answer questions with "Google" it's almost always the right answer
10 Apr 14:41 - Bongo: Cheers tegs!
10 Apr 14:42 - Tegan: I don't think Google calendars is as good as outlook somehow
10 Apr 14:43 - Tegan: Maybe it's because I don't check my Google account as often
10 Apr 14:43 - Tegan: Are you coming out tonight, Bongo?
10 Apr 14:47 - Bongo: Nah going down to redhill to see a mate about a job

10 Apr 19:54 - Dave: 5 mins
10 Apr 20:00 - Sam Roberts: George was full, hope to katzenjammer instead. Big beer!
11 Apr 12:42 - Tegan: How's Jules getting on?
11 Apr 12:48 - Sam Roberts: Yeah good, still on the mocktail sales trail
11 Apr 12:48 - Sam Roberts: He's gone from running a stall to distribution though
11 Apr 12:48 - Sam Roberts: Sounds hella hard work at the mo, could grow pretty quickly with a bit of luck though
11 Apr 12:48 - Tegan: I have no idea what that means :)
11 Apr 13:01 - Sam Roberts: Ah he has this little company selling alcohol free cocktails
11 Apr 13:01 - Sam Roberts: Or mocktails, for the cool kids
11 Apr 13:06 - Shaggy: Cocktail without alcohol is like anything without beer
11 Apr 15:07 - Steven: I can think of nothing that cannot he improved by alcohol.
11 Apr 15:10 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: Cycling lol
11 Apr 15:11 - Shaggy: It gives +10 to cycling but -100 to balance
11 Apr 15:14 - Sam Roberts: 3 beers gives you the best cycling skills
11 Apr 15:17 - Shaggy: But also remove any ability to resist drinking more beers
11 Apr 15:18 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: I agree, I think 3 beers Mike is better than me at a lot of things
11 Apr 15:18 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: At least 3 beers Mike thinks that
11 Apr 15:36 - Sam Roberts: 3 beers Mike is a real swell guy
11 Apr 15:37 - Sam Roberts: Speaking of, we're having a beer in Bermondsey if anyone wants some sun and fun
11 Apr 15:38 - Vanessa: Are you at the local breweries under the arches?
11 Apr 15:40 - Shaggy: Oh sweet I'll join ya

11 Apr 16:10 - Sam Roberts: <Media omitted>
11 Apr 16:40 - Hannah Murphy: Ru Paul!!!
11 Apr 17:53 - Shaggy: <Media omitted>
11 Apr 20:14 - Mateusz: What's happening people?
11 Apr 22:11 - Shaggy: Ah sorry dude just saw
11 Apr 22:12 - Shaggy: Just got out at e&c. What you up to?
12 Apr 10:19 - Sam Roberts: <Media omitted>
12 Apr 10:24 - Vinay: Just heard that news...
12 Apr 10:24 - Vinay: Not going d/l them to watch them all at once, though...
12 Apr 10:30 - Sam Roberts: It's going to be a rough 3 weeks...
12 Apr 10:33 - Shaggy: What...do we still do it every Monday or do we have a week of BBQ?
12 Apr 10:53 - Tegan: mondays!
12 Apr 10:53 - Tegan: Damn that full
12 Apr 10:53 - Tegan: fool
12 Apr 10:53 - Tegan: Just as mondays were about to have meaning again
12 Apr 10:56 - Dave: This is sad news. Mondays are an event woth GoT. If we just download it all then it will all be spent in a few days and forgotten rather than being a joy of spring and summer. I think we should all agree to only download one a week.
12 Apr 10:59 - Shaggy: I'm in. Very convincing argument
12 Apr 11:00 - Sam Roberts: Well spoken Dave! I'm in
12 Apr 11:01 - Sam Roberts: Just gotta go delete the imgur and reddit apps...
12 Apr 11:01 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: I reckon Joe is watching them as we speak lol
12 Apr 11:02 - Alex Bunn: If you watch all 4 then you have to wait a month for the 5th!!!
12 Apr 11:03 - Bongo: For the love of god, why would they do this to us?!
12 Apr 11:04 - Alex Bunn: Damn those hackers
12 Apr 11:09 - Dave: Glad it's only a few. I also wager joe is all over this!
12 Apr 11:10 - Alex Bunn: Looks like we'll have to silence him
12 Apr 11:11 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: I read that HBO send out screeners for TV reviewers
12 Apr 11:11 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: If that's true, it's completely retarded
12 Apr 11:12 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: Also, quality is only 480p, not good enough!
12 Apr 11:31 - Tegan: bah
12 Apr 11:31 - Tegan: I shit 480p
12 Apr 11:31 - Tegan: (I don't know what that means :))
12 Apr 11:38 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: 480p means not HD basically
12 Apr 11:39 - Owen: <Media omitted>
12 Apr 11:39 - Dan Sluckin: Hahaha
12 Apr 11:39 - Dan Sluckin: Keep it!
12 Apr 11:40 - Eliza: Shut up Dan! He will listen to you.
12 Apr 11:40 - Lorna: Is quite convenient it ran out of battery just as you shaved a moustache
12 Apr 11:41 - Eliza: No, not convenient. That is the opposite of convenient.
12 Apr 11:43 - Owen: The reason my head is turned like that is to hide the extra long side burn
12 Apr 11:46 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: Kill it with fire
12 Apr 11:51 - Bongo: Hahaha
12 Apr 11:52 - Bongo: <Media omitted>
12 Apr 12:02 - Joe Jarman: <Media omitted>
12 Apr 12:05 - Bongo: None of that joe
12 Apr 12:06 - Joe Jarman: Watch the full episode now on.... Whatsapp!
12 Apr 12:06 - Joe Jarman: 20 3 minute chunks
12 Apr 12:06 - Joe Jarman: For maximum enjoyment
12 Apr 12:08 - Owen: 20 3second chunks that are the biggest spoilers.
12 Apr 12:10 - Joe Jarman: Nah that's just the intro
12 Apr 12:12 - Owen: Wow I just watched it. Who would have thought that snape is really the ghost of arya.
12 Apr 12:14 - Shaggy: Snape, snape, Severus snape
12 Apr 19:41 - Vanessa: Does anybody have marketing experience/specialisation?
12 Apr 19:47 - Bongo: In what context?
12 Apr 19:48 - Vanessa: Events
12 Apr 19:48 - Bongo: We have a mate who used to do it for a living
12 Apr 19:48 - Bongo: Sam saw him yesterday!
12 Apr 19:49 - Vanessa: I'm doing an event to get people to sign up to a service. I'm wondering when is the best time after the event to send a message to get them to sign up
12 Apr 19:49 - Vanessa: The mocktail guy?
12 Apr 19:49 - Bongo: Yea!
12 Apr 19:51 - Bongo: With my extremely limited knowledge of marketing is say anywhere between 2 days and a week
12 Apr 19:51 - Vanessa: Lol
12 Apr 19:51 - Vanessa: I need them to sign up ASAP
12 Apr 19:53 - Bongo: Should've done it at the event then
12 Apr 19:53 - Vanessa: It hasn't happened
12 Apr 19:53 - Vanessa: Yet
12 Apr 19:54 - Vanessa: So I basically need them to sign up soon after they leave the event
12 Apr 19:54 - Bongo: Ahh
12 Apr 19:54 - Bongo: Can't you try to get them to do it at the event?
12 Apr 19:54 - Vanessa: It's online booking so I could but most will be occupied with their kids
12 Apr 19:56 - Bongo: Does it involve money?
12 Apr 19:56 - Vanessa: The booking yes, they are paying for a service
12 Apr 19:56 - Vanessa: The event is free
12 Apr 19:57 - Bongo: Send them an email straight after then
12 Apr 19:57 - Bongo: As just a thanks for coming email
12 Apr 19:57 - Vanessa: Yeah that's what I was thinking but I didn't know exactly how long to wait
12 Apr 19:57 - Bongo: But with a subtle "give me all your money" at the end
12 Apr 19:57 - Vanessa: I've already written the text to send them
12 Apr 19:58 - Vanessa: üí∞üí∞üí∞üí∞
12 Apr 19:58 - Bongo: Straight after the event
12 Apr 19:58 - Vanessa: Ok cool
12 Apr 19:58 - Bongo: My 2-7 days answer earlier was assuming you'd already bugged them at the event
12 Apr 19:58 - Vanessa: Thanks for your advice
12 Apr 19:59 - Vanessa: I will follow up with an email a week later
12 Apr 19:59 - Bongo: Np! As with most of my advice I take no responsibility for the outcome
12 Apr 19:59 - Vanessa: That's ok
12 Apr 19:59 - Vanessa: I'll just remember to lace all your food with sugar
12 Apr 20:00 - Bongo: Like my advice to shaggy to keep on drinking when he clearly shouldn't have kept on drinking
12 Apr 20:00 - Bongo: Ah dude I've broken the sugar thing hard lately
12 Apr 20:01 - Bongo: <Media omitted>
12 Apr 20:01 - Bongo: Two words: fizzy laces
12 Apr 20:01 - Vanessa: Sunday dinner
12 Apr 22:27 - Shaggy: Nine eleven
13 Apr 08:00 - Sam Roberts: Happy game of thrones day everyone!
13 Apr 08:00 - Dave: Yay!
13 Apr 08:01 - Sam Roberts: üçõ + üçó +üç∫ to celebrate!
13 Apr 08:01 - Dave: üëë
13 Apr 08:02 - Sam Roberts: üòÉ
13 Apr 08:02 - Sam Roberts: üò≥
13 Apr 08:02 - Sam Roberts: üò±
13 Apr 08:02 - Sam Roberts: üòµ
13 Apr 08:02 - Dave: üíÄ
13 Apr 08:02 - Sam Roberts: The story of Oberyn
13 Apr 08:02 - Sam Roberts: Haha
13 Apr 08:03 - Dave: Too soon
13 Apr 08:03 - Dave: üò≠
13 Apr 08:14 - Bongo: Woohoo game of thrones! What time are we barbying?
13 Apr 08:16 - Sam Roberts: Early if poss, gets dark about 7.30 at the mo, so half six would be great
13 Apr 08:17 - Sam Roberts: You ready to make your return as Lord of the lamb chop bong?
13 Apr 08:23 - Bongo: üò¶
13 Apr 08:23 - Bongo: But there's not enough time to marinade?!
13 Apr 08:23 - Bongo: I'll improvise!!
13 Apr 08:24 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: Fried egg!
13 Apr 08:24 - Bongo: Egg fried between two half cooked pork chops is always a good fall back
13 Apr 08:25 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: üéº it's the most, wonderful time, of the year üé∂
13 Apr 08:55 - Sam Roberts: Maybe if you massage the marinade it'll soak faster
13 Apr 09:24 - Bongo: I heard if you put an egg between the chops it also makes it marinade faster
13 Apr 09:34 - Dave: I heard if you put an egg on an egg it makes it eggier
13 Apr 09:34 - Dave: üê£
13 Apr 09:40 - Tegan: Yay for eggs!
13 Apr 09:53 - Alex Bunn: Yay! If you look after them correctly they turn into delicious meat
13 Apr 09:54 - Bongo: And sometimes a Jesus pops out
13 Apr 09:54 - Tegan: other steps need tobe in place for that to happen
13 Apr 09:54 - Alex Bunn: üê£üê•üêîüçóüçó
13 Apr 09:55 - Bongo: That's how Easter works right?
13 Apr 09:55 - Tegan: When mummt and daddy chickens love each other very much etc
13 Apr 12:02 - Alex Bunn: So who's coming round tonight??
13 Apr 12:02 - Alex Bunn: Hype hype hype
13 Apr 12:03 - Tegan: hype!
13 Apr 12:03 - Tegan: 'xcited
13 Apr 12:03 - Shaggy: Hype!
13 Apr 12:12 - Sadie: Me!
13 Apr 12:12 - Shaggy: You were supposed to say hype!
13 Apr 12:12 - Bongo: Hype hype hype!
13 Apr 12:12 - Shaggy removed Sadie
13 Apr 12:13 - Shaggy added Sadie
13 Apr 12:14 - Shaggy: Try again
13 Apr 12:15 - Sadie: Hype..hype..
13 Apr 12:17 - Bongo: Shaggy stop bullying your colleagues
13 Apr 12:18 - Shaggy: Bitch, don't tell me what to do
13 Apr 12:18 - Shaggy removed Bongo
13 Apr 12:21 - Shaggy added Bongo
13 Apr 12:39 - Loz: I won't be able to make it tonight but I'm keen to join next week!!
13 Apr 12:46 - Bongo: We need to decide on how we're going to watch them
13 Apr 12:46 - Bongo: First one today then next three on the weekend?
13 Apr 12:46 - Bongo: Or one a week?
13 Apr 12:47 - Dave: One a week
13 Apr 12:51 - Bongo: Next week round shabongo's?
13 Apr 12:51 - Bongo: Or is that going to cause massive aggro from c town lol
13 Apr 12:52 - Dave: You'll need a bbq or equivalent delight
13 Apr 12:53 - Bongo: Damnit you're right
13 Apr 13:00 - Joe Jarman: You don't have a television
13 Apr 13:00 - Joe Jarman: Either
13 Apr 13:00 - Joe Jarman: Or any furniture
13 Apr 13:02 - Joe Jarman: After you've met these requirements, you can submit an application to the game of thrones hosting committee
13 Apr 13:08 - Eliza: Two hypes here. What can we bring?
13 Apr 13:12 - Bongo: We have furniture, agree about the tv though, we're still working on the 72' screen
13 Apr 13:21 - Lorna: Hype!
13 Apr 13:50 - Tegan: Further hype!
13 Apr 13:51 - Tegan: enough work!
13 Apr 13:55 - Bongo: Lol @ people at work
13 Apr 13:56 - Alex Bunn: You have the honourable position of replacing the phil as chief meat prep guy
13 Apr 13:56 - Alex Bunn: Prep that meat!
13 Apr 13:57 - Bongo: Ah bugger I knew I was meant to be doing something
13 Apr 13:58 - Bongo: Marinading will seriously take too long
13 Apr 13:59 - Bongo: I might just slap sauce on it
13 Apr 13:59 - Bongo: If I get the technique right maybe I can punch it into the meat
13 Apr 13:59 - Bongo: I'll call Phil, he'll know what to do
13 Apr 14:06 - Owen: Bbq sauce
13 Apr 14:07 - Owen: You don't need to marrinade if you are using bbq sauce
13 Apr 14:16 - Bongo: Ready made BBQ sauce?
13 Apr 14:28 - Owen: Could do. It is easy to make though. Eliza might be able to tell you how, her bbq sauce is saucegasmnic!
13 Apr 14:34 - Bongo: <Media omitted>
13 Apr 14:34 - Bongo: Going to try this with onions, parsley and garlic
13 Apr 14:38 - Owen: Mistake! Make your own its easy! We can bring liquid smoke if you are missing that.
13 Apr 14:39 - Tegan: How was your interview, dude?
13 Apr 14:39 - Owen: Oh yeah! How'd it go?
13 Apr 14:57 - Bongo: Ok, we can make it in c town then
13 Apr 14:57 - Bongo: I smashed the interview, it's a pretty drawn out one though
13 Apr 14:57 - Bongo: Two more rounds, 5 more people to see
13 Apr 14:58 - Owen: Did you get asked what you greatest weakness was?
13 Apr 14:59 - Bongo: No, mostly experience questions
13 Apr 14:59 - Owen: And did you then answer "I often get told I work too hard and well"
13 Apr 14:59 - Bongo: Then all of sudden random programming questions I had to write on paper
13 Apr 15:01 - Bongo: Lol I've heard some really stupid answers to that question
13 Apr 15:01 - Bongo: That's nowhere near as bad as some of them
13 Apr 15:02 - Owen: "I often chase other employees with a mallet"... "oh sorry, you wanted me to lie"
13 Apr 15:04 - Bongo: Someone said "i start hearing a voice in my head when I get stressed telling me what to do"
13 Apr 15:04 - Bongo: Not in an interview I was in, but that's still extremely creepy
13 Apr 15:05 - Owen: "I have been told that I am too generous a lover....  Ladies"
13 Apr 15:06 - Owen: Wow,  that's mega creepy, why would you answer that in an interview.
13 Apr 15:07 - Owen: I bet he went away with the voice saying "nailed it!"
13 Apr 15:08 - Bongo: Haha yea "nailed it! Well done chap. Now.. Er.. Burn that chair.."
13 Apr 15:09 - Owen: To be fair that is such a pointlessly crap question for anything but a sales job. It's basically the same as asking "could you bull shit for us a bit please"
13 Apr 15:18 - Bongo: Yea I've never asked it
13 Apr 15:19 - Bongo: I usually ask something along the lines of "if I were to suggest getting wasted for the next hour, what would you do?"
13 Apr 15:20 - Owen: I've not been asked it.  To be fair teaching interviews are pretty good.  You just teach a lesson and if you do well then the interview is just to make sure you aren't a complete loon.
13 Apr 15:21 - Owen: Is the correct answer "I would"
13 Apr 15:25 - Bongo: That only gets half marks
13 Apr 15:25 - Bongo: The correct answer is the sound of a beer being opened
13 Apr 15:57 - Shaggy: Let's start organizing this shiz
13 Apr 16:21 - Owen: What time will someone actually be in at Canning town.  Last time me and Eliza turned up at the designated time there was no one in.
13 Apr 16:21 - Angela: I think that's a formal letter of complaint!
13 Apr 16:22 - Joe Jarman: Frank.is always in
13 Apr 16:22 - Owen: I'm going to make Bbq sauce here.
13 Apr 16:22 - Joe Jarman: He hasn't taken to bbqing as much as we hoped
13 Apr 16:22 - Owen: He should with a name like frank
13 Apr 16:22 - Joe Jarman: He looks like he should be wicked at bbqing
13 Apr 16:26 - Alex Bunn: He's all about that protein
13 Apr 16:30 - Shaggy: <Media omitted>
13 Apr 16:36 - Alex Bunn: üò±
13 Apr 16:36 - Alex Bunn: The sassagr flair
13 Apr 16:37 - Alex Bunn: Sassages are coming
13 Apr 16:38 - Shaggy: Yes
13 Apr 16:38 - Shaggy: I've got to go to balham first though to retrieve my card
13 Apr 16:46 - Alex Bunn: Did you leave it in a pub?
13 Apr 16:57 - Tegan: I'm aiming for around 6.30
13 Apr 16:57 - Tegan: wit vegan delights
13 Apr 17:00 - Shaggy: Yup, left without paying the tab
13 Apr 17:00 - Bongo: I have the chops btw Owen, if you're good to make the BBQ sauce
13 Apr 17:03 - Shaggy: Lol shit, I wish I just said I lost it
13 Apr 17:04 - Owen: Bbq sauce is simmering atm
13 Apr 17:27 - Lorna: I'll be there for 6:30ish. Any requests for food etc to bring?
13 Apr 17:51 - Shaggy: I got the sassage
13 Apr 17:51 - Shaggy: As indicated by flair
13 Apr 17:56 - Shaggy: Jubilee line is pretty fucked, I would recommend dlr from bank
13 Apr 17:57 - Sadie: We're bringing a few burgers, some halloumi, crisps and hummus
13 Apr 18:03 - Owen: From where shagzilla?
13 Apr 18:03 - Owen: We get on at Canada water
13 Apr 18:07 - Owen: Actually we will just continue on to shadwell and dlt
13 Apr 18:07 - Owen: Dlr*
13 Apr 18:09 - Shaggy: Yeah that's easier, jubilee is hella delayed so tonnes of people
13 Apr 18:12 - Steven: Jubilee is a disaster
13 Apr 18:14 - Shaggy: I did warn you
13 Apr 18:15 - Sam Roberts: Boo meetings
13 Apr 18:16 - Sam Roberts: Just jumping in the bike, back in 30
13 Apr 18:16 - Sam Roberts: Sorry sorry sorry to anyone who's there before that!
13 Apr 18:19 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: Central line is horrendous too agggh
14 Apr 07:55 - Tegan: Hey guys - did I leave my bag in your garden?
14 Apr 07:57 - Sam Roberts: <Media omitted>
14 Apr 07:59 - Tegan: ooh, can you bring me the green one
14 Apr 08:00 - Sam Roberts: I, I'll be there in 5
14 Apr 08:02 - Tegan: I'll swap you an awesome coffee
14 Apr 08:02 - Tegan: is it super cheeky to ask you to take it to kx with you?
14 Apr 08:03 - Sam Roberts: Hehe yes, I'm on it üòâ
14 Apr 08:03 - Tegan: Whoop! Thanks Slam
14 Apr 08:03 - Sam Roberts: Did you pack it with rocks!?
14 Apr 08:04 - Tegan: 'alledgedly' I had too much to 'drink'
14 Apr 08:04 - Tegan: Sorry
14 Apr 08:05 - Tegan: excellent inaugural Monday, everyone
14 Apr 08:38 - Bongo: Haha yea that was thoroughly meaty and game of thronesy
14 Apr 08:49 - Sam Roberts: Lot if fun
14 Apr 08:50 - Sam Roberts: Our garden looks like Barbageddon
14 Apr 08:55 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: Aporkalypse
14 Apr 08:57 - Sam Roberts: fitting, Bongo's marinade was the Blend of thyme
14 Apr 08:58 - Sam Roberts: Was that the biggest one yet?
14 Apr 08:59 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: We all fit in the projector room
14 Apr 08:59 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: So no
14 Apr 09:00 - Sam Roberts: Ish... Bongo sat on me and Cate
14 Apr 09:00 - Shaggy: It's the first year of dual couching
14 Apr 09:03 - Owen: Bongo's marinade?  BONGO'S MARINADE?!
14 Apr 09:04 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: Good job bongo
14 Apr 09:11 - Owen: BBBOOOONNNNGGGGGOOOOOOO!!?!?!?!!!?
14 Apr 09:28 - Alex Bunn: Was daario a different guy from last season?
14 Apr 09:33 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: Definitely not the original guy
14 Apr 09:33 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: <Media omitted>
14 Apr 09:37 - Bongo: Cheers guys, I put a lot of love into that marinade
14 Apr 10:00 - Alex Bunn: That was the dude from season 3
14 Apr 10:17 - Shaggy: Haha
14 Apr 11:43 - Owen: A bear walks into a bar, he sits down and immediately mauls to death and devours the woman on the stool next to him. he then calmly orders a beer

bartender: "sorry, we don't serve drug users in here" bear: "but I don't do drugs" bartender: "what about that barbitchyouate"
14 Apr 11:55 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: Lol, good joke bongo
14 Apr 11:58 - Bongo: Cheers, my creative humour knows no limits
14 Apr 11:59 - Owen: Oh god.  This is my worst nightmare.
14 Apr 11:59 - Bongo: No it's not I'm actually having a really nice day
14 Apr 12:00 - Owen: You'll pay for this in time.
14 Apr 12:04 - Owen: Actually I might use this against my more attention seeking pupils. Just start falsely attributing thier behaviour to others and praising them for it.
14 Apr 12:13 - Shaggy: Great idea, bongo
14 Apr 14:19 - Vanessa: Don't talk of the episode yesterday I still haven't seen it
14 Apr 14:32 - Owen: Ned starks ghost came back and ate off jofferys dead face! It was amazing!
14 Apr 15:01 - Owen: It also turned out carl drogo and the dragon drogon were the same thing all along... The clue was in the name.
14 Apr 15:03 - Angela: http://voteswap.org/
14 Apr 15:08 - Shaggy: Carl drogo is basically Carl pilkington as khal
14 Apr 15:10 - Owen: Voteswap is awesome.  Its a shame they don't have it for lib dems as well. I have to vote lib dem in my stupid area even though i really don't want to.
14 Apr 15:12 - Angela: I would feel like I had to vote labour without it, which I'm not particularly keen to do and would only do cos my MP is good. Voting for ed miliband though, euch
14 Apr 15:13 - Dave: This is great
14 Apr 15:14 - Shaggy: I like milliband
14 Apr 15:14 - Shaggy: He is the only sincere and passionate one
14 Apr 15:14 - Shaggy: He may be a bit goofy though
14 Apr 15:16 - Shaggy: It doesn't matter what I vote though, in my area it's always been lib dems
14 Apr 15:16 - Owen: Problem is that in this country with our stupid system you are very unlikely to get to vote who you want.
14 Apr 15:16 - Angela: He may be sincere but he has no ideas of his own
14 Apr 15:17 - Dave: I think lib dems may be in for a rough ride this time shagz
14 Apr 15:17 - Angela: His main policy is "slightly less austerity than the conservatives"
14 Apr 15:17 - Owen: And free bus passes for dogs Angela.
14 Apr 15:18 - Angela: But cats though? When will this country see a sensible policy on bus passes for cats?
14 Apr 15:18 - Owen: It's like watching the kang and kodos election.
14 Apr 15:18 - Dave: Lol
14 Apr 15:18 - Owen: Everyone just says what you want to hear and whoever gets into power we are all gonna be slaves to an alien race.
14 Apr 15:19 - Owen: Except in my analogy the alien race are the rich.
14 Apr 15:19 - Dave: To be fair, there's about a 20bn pound divide between their spending plans as labour don't include capital expenditure
14 Apr 15:19 - Dave: *dustball comment*
14 Apr 15:21 - Owen: What counts as capital expenditure dave?
14 Apr 15:21 - Jimena: <Media omitted>
14 Apr 15:22 - Jimena: Free dog passes sound pretty sweet to me.
14 Apr 15:22 - Dave: Essentially it's investment, so anything outside of the day to day operating costs of the various departments
14 Apr 15:22 - Dave: So it would be money for building roads, houses, schools and statues of Keynes
14 Apr 15:23 - Dave: 45CHF! Not under a labour government!
14 Apr 15:23 - Owen: What is the reasoning behind not including it?
14 Apr 15:24 - Owen: Just because it is a one off?
14 Apr 15:24 - Dave: It means they can talk about balancing the books and still have money for investment
14 Apr 15:25 - Dave: It's a lot easier to argue for borrowing for investment than for operating costs
14 Apr 15:26 - Owen: Oh right.  Like when i bought that yacht, but it didn't affect my bank balance because i don't have to buy the yacht every year.
14 Apr 15:26 - Jimena: 45chf AND they are not even allowed on the seats!
14 Apr 15:27 - Owen: I'm sorry Jimena i was joking about milliband having free dog bus passes...  As far as i know anyway.
14 Apr 15:27 - Owen: Nigel farage only wants free dog passes for British dogs though.
14 Apr 15:28 - Owen: All those German Shepherds coming over here! Using our buses for free!
14 Apr 15:28 - Owen: And don't get me started on chihuahuas!
14 Apr 15:29 - Owen: Direct quote from the ukip party conference
14 Apr 15:30 - Dave: You happy with the capital expenditure point now O?
14 Apr 15:32 - Dave: Good
14 Apr 15:35 - Jimena: Pff typical.
14 Apr 15:37 - Jimena: Next thing u know they'll be increasing the bus pass fare for non-eu pets.
14 Apr 15:38 - Jimena: Just to cover the costs for the british ones.
14 Apr 15:38 - Jimena: üò¢
14 Apr 15:41 - Owen: Depends what you mean by happy. I understand what capital expenditure is.  But it seems like bullshit to not include it somehow in the deficit. Like my yacht example. Capital expenditure will still increase country debt so i don't see how you can just inore it.
14 Apr 15:42 - Owen: Like why not just add a capital expenditure budget of 20 trillion pounds and then just ignore it.
14 Apr 15:44 - Dave: Not sure i follow the last point. Lab have said they will balance the current account so you can't fiddle it with the capital account.
14 Apr 15:45 - Dave: On why the two are different. Arguably capital investments will bring a return to the country and which will be commensurate in the long term with the borrowing costs
14 Apr 15:46 - Dave: Now i would argue that the same is true of spending on social services, etc but the argument is more controversial
14 Apr 15:46 - Owen: I am a keynsian so i agree with extra capital spending.  I just think it is sneaky to not include it somehow.
14 Apr 15:46 - Dave: You have to borrow for major infrastructure projects
14 Apr 15:46 - Dave: You can't do it on tax revenues
14 Apr 15:47 - Owen: I know. But if you are borrowing that should add to the deficit.
14 Apr 15:47 - Owen: Even if you offset it across 4 years or something.
14 Apr 15:48 - Owen: Or however long their plan is.
14 Apr 15:51 - Dave: I don't see why. Current and capital spending are very different. currebt expenditure is like paying for food - one can argue that unless you are starving you shouldn't spend more on food than you earn. Capital spending is like buying a house - it's silly to save up for one, you borrow what you can afford.
14 Apr 15:51 - Dave: Idealogically there is a distinction between getting rid of a deficit which if based on all spending and one based on current spending
14 Apr 15:52 - Dave: It's not just a way of massaging figures
14 Apr 15:53 - Owen: I get that. But this whole deficit balancing task is being played off by both parties as a way of getting the country out of debt (a bit). So hiding the fact that you are increasing the debt even if you are balancing the deficit is disingenuous.
14 Apr 15:54 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: None of this matters, it's too boring for voters :b
14 Apr 15:56 - Owen: Also i would argue that capital expenditure in the case of a country is a reccuring cost. Just because it is being spent on one off projects doesn't mean another one off project won't come along in a year or two. It isn't the same as me buying a house. 

Also even if you do treat it as the same as me buying a house.  When i buy a house i have to pay it back. Those repayments become part of my personal deficit.  The government will have to payback the money eventually too in whatever means,  inflation or otherwise.
14 Apr 15:57 - Angela: But buying a house isn't the same as having a personal deficit because the money grows
14 Apr 15:57 - Owen: Mortgage repayments are a personal deficit.
14 Apr 15:58 - Angela: And you can borrow against the rising value to gain more money for investment. This isn't the same as just getting into more debt
14 Apr 15:58 - Angela: You technically owe more money but your assets are worth more
14 Apr 15:58 - Owen: Thata true Angela
14 Apr 15:58 - Dave: Indeed, it's a secured loan
14 Apr 15:58 - Owen: Thats*
14 Apr 15:59 - Owen: Good point
14 Apr 15:59 - Angela: I don't know whether the value of whatever the gov is investing in will also grow though?
14 Apr 15:59 - Owen: I think I have changed my mind.
14 Apr 15:59 - Dave: Although the government can't just sell thw M25
14 Apr 15:59 - Dave: Or could they...
14 Apr 15:59 - Owen: They could privatise it
14 Apr 16:00 - Dave: Indeed
14 Apr 16:01 - Owen: This is what I worry about if we get another tory government.
14 Apr 16:01 - Angela: Yeah definitely. I mean they sold the Eurostar which is majorly in profit
14 Apr 16:01 - Owen: This election has just become about a fucking number.
14 Apr 16:02 - Angela: For like 0.00001% deficit reduction
14 Apr 16:02 - Owen: And the tories seem to value making that number zero over any othwr concern.
14 Apr 16:02 - Angela: It's all clearly ideological
14 Apr 16:03 - Dave: Agree
14 Apr 16:03 - Owen: David Cameron blatantly talks like that.  When asked about his promises on things like youth unemployment.  His reply is always "those promises weren't the important ones, deficit reduction was"
14 Apr 16:06 - Owen: He basically says "i care about making this number zero over anything else, including the people." what irks me is that the media and the other main parties go along with this bullshit. The tory party have very shrewdly changed the message.  So that this election has become about the one thing they actually did achive: deficit reduction.
14 Apr 16:06 - Angela: That's so true
14 Apr 16:07 - Angela: Labour have completely fallen into line with the Tory 'divide and conquer' mentality of blaming everything bad that happens on people slightly poorer and therefore lazier than you
14 Apr 16:08 - Angela: Which I think is a major contributor to the success of ukip
14 Apr 16:08 - Owen: Labour and the lib dems should have been calling him on this and they haven't been.  So now its so ingrained that we don't get to discuss people anymore we have to discuss this fucking number. And I don't even get to vote for a party that isn't buying into Cameron bullshit because if I do that waxwork snake will get into power again.  I am fucking sick of it.
14 Apr 16:09 - Angela: Haha waxwork snake
14 Apr 16:10 - Owen: He looks like a madame tusaauds puppet came alive and then somehow started  running the country
14 Apr 16:11 - Angela: Has anybody checked whether the Cameron waxwork is missing...?
14 Apr 16:12 - Owen: I take it back.  The madame tussauds Cameron looks more realistic becausr at least it has a moustache.
14 Apr 16:12 - Owen: <Media omitted>
14 Apr 16:13 - Bongo: I lol'd
14 Apr 16:13 - Angela: It actually does look more like a human
14 Apr 16:14 - Alex Bunn: Iv enjoyed reading this üëç
14 Apr 16:14 - Shaggy: He's get my vote
14 Apr 16:14 - Bongo: Reducing the deficit should be one of the highest priorities though
14 Apr 16:14 - Owen: Not over people.
14 Apr 16:15 - Bongo: Jobs and the economy are affected by the deficit though
14 Apr 16:15 - Angela: As I heard someone say on the radio, Tory policies are like deciding not to feed your kids because you want to pay off the mortgage faster
14 Apr 16:15 - Bongo: We can choose to ignore it and later down the line pay for it massively
14 Apr 16:15 - Owen: The economy is also affected by youth unemployment.
14 Apr 16:16 - Bongo: Or deal with it now at the expense of other things
14 Apr 16:16 - Bongo: Yea but that trade off unfortunately works in the deficit reduction's favour because we are so massively in debt
14 Apr 16:16 - Bongo: Interest on our debt is huuuuge
14 Apr 16:17 - Bongo: Reducing it by a linear about is saving us much much more than spending a linear amount on anything
14 Apr 16:19 - Dave: Would you accept a tax rise rather than a cut under that logic?
14 Apr 16:19 - Owen: Yeah but there are two ways to reduce a defict
14 Apr 16:19 - Angela: I would accept big companies being made to pay their tax
14 Apr 16:19 - Bongo: Tax rise if everyone on the country agrees that removing debt is the best option
14 Apr 16:20 - Bongo: *in
14 Apr 16:20 - Owen: You don't have to do it by spending less. You can do it by raising more.  And the fact you didn't think of that first just shows how well the tories have manipulated the media and the other parties.
14 Apr 16:20 - Bongo: But you don't want people to move out of the country to avoid tax
14 Apr 16:21 - Owen: That is nonsense though bongo.  Its been shown time and time again not to be true.
14 Apr 16:21 - Angela: I think a lot of that is scaremongering. When the minimum wage was introduced the main argument against it was that companies would all react by firing a load of employees. But that didn't happen
14 Apr 16:21 - Angela: If here's the political will then companies tend to fall into line
14 Apr 16:21 - Bongo: People moving out of the country to avoid tax?
14 Apr 16:22 - Angela: The will just doesn't exist
14 Apr 16:22 - Bongo: Big companies already avoid tax by moving out often he country
14 Apr 16:23 - Angela: But they still sell goods in this country
14 Apr 16:23 - Angela: And avoid paying tax on those by not being registered here. There's a loophole to be closed
14 Apr 16:23 - Bongo: The grey area where startups are starting up in the uk could easily just move to other countries
14 Apr 16:23 - Angela: They won't want to stop selling goods here
14 Apr 16:23 - Angela: I'm talking about Amazon though, not startups
14 Apr 16:24 - Angela: It's about making companies pay the tax that is due, not raising all business tax
14 Apr 16:24 - Owen: But you don't increase corporate tax.  You just increase income tax
14 Apr 16:24 - Dave: The amount of tax due from corporates but unclaimed would kill the deficit
14 Apr 16:25 - Bongo: Yea, let's just do that
14 Apr 16:26 - Dave: I may have slightly overstated my last point (need to check the figures) but certainly it would put a fair dent in it
14 Apr 16:26 - Angela: I've also heard that it would be more than the deficit
14 Apr 16:27 - Owen: No.  Bongo, lets cut public services instead. Especially any service aimed at the weak or poor.
14 Apr 16:27 - Bongo: Can we start our own country somewhere hotter than england?
14 Apr 16:27 - Angela: Maybe if it's backdated?
14 Apr 16:28 - Bongo: No one wants to cut public spending
14 Apr 16:28 - Angela: The Conservative party really do
14 Apr 16:29 - Bongo: Well that's just silly
14 Apr 16:32 - Owen: And the problem is that they won't cut health or education (not that they should) because that would lose them votes. Which means that small departments have to take the hit.  A 1% cut to the NHS would be equivalent to a 50% cut on another department.
14 Apr 16:33 - Angela: Though actually neither party is protecting the education budget in their manifesto
14 Apr 16:33 - Owen: The NHS could survive a 1% cut.  A little department can't survive a 50% cut and still do what it does.
14 Apr 16:33 - Owen: They kept saying that education was a protected area during the debates though.
14 Apr 16:34 - Owen: Those little areas are things like libraries. Which are really vital for poor people, but that votera don't generally give a shit about.
14 Apr 16:34 - Angela: Yeah they have protected it either against inflation or per pupil, but no party has committed to both. So if pupil numbers rise or there's inflation, it could still potentially decline in real terms
14 Apr 16:34 - Dave: A report i just found estimates in 2014, 122bn in lost tax (85bn from avoidance, 19bn avoidance and 18bn tax not paid)
14 Apr 16:35 - Owen: 18bn just not paid.  Lol
14 Apr 16:35 - Owen: I wish i could get away with just not paying my tax.
14 Apr 16:35 - Bongo: Become a contractor
14 Apr 16:36 - Shaggy: 85 and 19 are both avoidance?
14 Apr 16:36 - Dave: 85 is evasion (ie illegal)
14 Apr 16:36 - Dave: 19 avoidance through loopholes
14 Apr 16:36 - Bongo: Our deficit last year in total was 107bln
14 Apr 16:36 - Bongo: So just that one year of paying would have wiped the slate clean
14 Apr 16:36 - Owen: So Dave was right and some.
14 Apr 16:37 - Owen: For that year yes.
14 Apr 16:37 - Bongo: But given that it's accumulating at such a high rate and the interest accruing on top of that
14 Apr 16:38 - Bongo: Just one year of paying it all back would be amazing
14 Apr 16:38 - Owen: Interst bill is 43bn alone
14 Apr 16:41 - Hannah Murphy: It's all about improving productivity guys! Kthnxbai
14 Apr 16:43 - Bongo: Nothing improves productivity like another war
14 Apr 16:43 - Bongo: Let's go invade someone
14 Apr 16:43 - Shaggy: I nominate tissue
14 Apr 16:43 - Owen: After delving into this more.  Wales is getting screwed! They have 6.6% of the uk population but only 2% of its spending. Bull shit.  I am voting plaid cymru
14 Apr 16:43 - Shaggy: Russia
14 Apr 16:45 - Dave: Wales got a pretty bad deal during devolution compared to scotland
14 Apr 16:45 - Owen: Scotland respectivel numbers are 8.4% and 3.7% so they didn't do so well either.
14 Apr 16:45 - Bongo: I think we'd get screwed over by Russia personally
14 Apr 16:46 - Bongo: It's pretty much straight sailing between them and us
14 Apr 16:46 - Owen: Let's take back Australia.  They have barely any defense and loads of resources.
14 Apr 16:46 - Dave: Hmm, need to check thoae numbers take account of rhe effects of devolution
14 Apr 16:46 - Dave: I heard Scotland had more spending per head than england
14 Apr 16:47 - Owen: Yeah I'm not sure exactly what the numbers mean dave.
14 Apr 16:47 - Owen: Presumably they don't include  education and health
14 Apr 16:48 - Hannah Murphy: Scotland did very well on the free university side of things
14 Apr 16:52 - Dave: Bbc (quoting the treasury) states scotland has 10876 per head, wales just under 10000 and england has 8529
14 Apr 16:52 - Dave: In 2012-13
14 Apr 16:53 - Angela: UKIP should really be focusing on Scotland
14 Apr 16:53 - Owen: Ah ok.  The numbers i got must not have included health etc spending in wales under "health" not "wales'
14 Apr 16:53 - Angela: Bloody parasites
14 Apr 16:55 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: I thought Scotland GDP is higher than average though?
14 Apr 16:56 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: Not GDP, but they pay roughly a fair amount of tax considering spending
14 Apr 17:25 - Dave: There's a measure called gva (groas value added) which measures how much regions add to gdp. England had 21937 per head and scotland 20013 in 2012 according to the ONS
14 Apr 17:27 - Dave: Wikipedia gives 2014 numbers as 24091 and 21982 respectively
14 Apr 17:27 - Dave: I am data today
14 Apr 17:39 - Bongo: GDP is a bit of a useless stat though right?
14 Apr 17:53 - Lorna: Free Ben and Jerry's ice cream! And sunshine and park! Heading to marble arch now for all of the above x
14 Apr 17:56 - Owen: Two economists are walking down the road and see a turd.  One says to the other I'll give you ¬£20,000 to eat that turd. The other weighs up his options and decides eating it is the rational choice. They keep walking and now the second one sees a turd, he proposes the first eats it for ¬£20,000. The first makes the rational choice and eats it. They keep walking for a bit and the first says wait a minute we both have as much money as we did before the walk but our mouths taste like shit. The second replies "yes, but we increased our GDP by ¬£40,000"
14 Apr 17:56 - Owen: TLDR yes bongo gdp is a pretty silly stat.
14 Apr 18:04 - Bongo: It's a ridiculously old one that needs updating
14 Apr 18:06 - Bongo: I'd give a medal to anyone who can give a number to a country's output
14 Apr 18:07 - Owen: I think how many times i mention my own name should be one.  I only do that during periods of growth.
14 Apr 18:07 - Owen: Actually mike.  You should graph that.
14 Apr 18:07 - Owen: See if it is at all true
14 Apr 18:08 - Tegan: lol. I hope it's true
14 Apr 18:08 - Tegan: excellent calibre of discussion this afternoon, everyone
14 Apr 18:09 - Tegan: I feel more informed than I did by my whole journey with the evening standard
14 Apr 19:13 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: Someone listens to planet money
14 Apr 19:14 - Dave: Who? Bongo or bongo?
14 Apr 19:14 - Owen: Yep.  I liked that one.
14 Apr 19:14 - Owen: Goddamn it!
14 Apr 19:14 - Owen: Seriously i am scared that i am losing my identity
15 Apr 10:21 - Bongo: Holy crap it's hot
15 Apr 10:22 - Bongo: I'm roasting like crispy duck
15 Apr 11:10 - Owen: You chose a good time to get unemployed

15 Apr 13:07 - Lorna: How about tomorrow for dishoom? I'm game, but busy tonight
15 Apr 13:15 - Alex Bunn: Whats dishoon?
15 Apr 13:19 - Vinay: I was afraid to ask that question
15 Apr 13:19 - Shaggy: Indian
15 Apr 13:20 - Lorna: Its tasty Indian. Tapas style
15 Apr 13:25 - Shaggy: Have you been to the one on shoreditch high st?
15 Apr 13:43 - Bongo: Shoreditch > Covent Garden one

15 Apr 13:44 - Bongo: Aw I wana go today can't do tomorrow

15 Apr 14:07 - Tegan: We're going today for sure
15 Apr 14:07 - Tegan: Sorry lorna
15 Apr 14:21 - Lorna: üòû
15 Apr 14:21 - Lorna: Enjoy!
15 Apr 14:53 - Bongo: Park first though?
15 Apr 15:08 - Shaggy: Definitely.
15 Apr 15:13 - Bongo: Which one?
15 Apr 15:14 - Bongo: <Media omitted>
15 Apr 15:14 - Bongo: I just got this in the mail, my name's been changed on the electoral register?
15 Apr 15:14 - Bongo: To what? Cornelius bigglesworth?
15 Apr 15:21 - Owen: Find out.  Maybe there's vote rigging afoot.
15 Apr 15:32 - Shaggy added Lora
15 Apr 15:37 - Hannah Murphy: After the last election I got a message saying my vote didn't count cos they didn't believe it was me!!! It was!!! Accused of fraud against myself...
15 Apr 15:37 - Tegan: We could hang out around granary square
15 Apr 15:38 - Tegan: fountains are nice and it stays sunny for ages
15 Apr 15:38 - Tegan: No head though
15 Apr 15:38 - Tegan: I'd be livid if I got a letter after the fact to say they'd discounted my vote! I wonder how many people that happened to
15 Apr 15:40 - Lorna: How do they know which vote is yours?
15 Apr 15:41 - Tegan: Good point. ..
15 Apr 15:41 - Hannah Murphy: It was a postal vote
15 Apr 15:41 - Hannah Murphy: So I had to sign
15 Apr 15:42 - Hannah Murphy: To prove 'twas me. Seems like I had fashionably revamped my signature or something
15 Apr 16:51 - Shaggy: So anyone up for sitting on the grass with a beverage of choice?
15 Apr 16:51 - Shaggy: Regents park is nice
15 Apr 16:51 - Shaggy: Justsayin
15 Apr 16:52 - Lora: Regents is sorta far-ish
15 Apr 16:52 - Lora: How about grass in front of Tate next to river?
15 Apr 16:54 - Shaggy: Sure, that's way closer for me
15 Apr 16:54 - Tegan: I think you should come to granary square and then come for dinner
15 Apr 16:55 - Tegan: My opinion
15 Apr 16:55 - Shaggy: That's like your opinion, man
15 Apr 16:55 - Lora: Dishoom? The q there is torture and they don't let you drink in it
15 Apr 16:56 - Tegan: I need one more person to agree to come so I can book a table
15 Apr 17:00 - Bongo: Just book it anyway
15 Apr 17:00 - Bongo: Worst case scenario we'll make a friend
15 Apr 17:00 - Bongo: And bring them in
15 Apr 17:01 - Tegan: God that's clever
15 Apr 17:01 - Tegan: fiendishly clever
15 Apr 17:05 - Tegan: They're not picking up now. ..
15 Apr 17:05 - Tegan: Might have missed the reservation window. ..
15 Apr 17:12 - Bongo: Bail and book it another day?
15 Apr 17:12 - Tegan: Nah, I think dave and Marth and xav and I will still grab dinner
15 Apr 17:13 - Tegan: See what the queue is like, or try somewhere Elgar
15 Apr 17:13 - Tegan: You know elgar
15 Apr 17:13 - Tegan: Come along if you fancy, it'll be dark by then
15 Apr 17:19 - Bongo: Elgar?! Thou knowest the feud betwixt our bloodlines runs deeper than the rivers of blood spilt between our peoples!
15 Apr 17:20 - Bongo: Yea, maybe I'll partake, I'll see how southbank fairs with shaggy
15 Apr 17:23 - Tegan: coo
15 Apr 17:24 - Shaggy: Coup

15 Apr 17:27 - Lora: He said you're going to queen of hoxton lol
15 Apr 17:27 - Shaggy: What's the anchor?
15 Apr 17:28 - Lora: At the river dum dum
15 Apr 17:28 - Shaggy: Oh that place
15 Apr 17:28 - Shaggy: Just meet at the green
15 Apr 17:28 - Bongo: Which one? Outside the Tate?
15 Apr 17:29 - Shaggy: Ja
15 Apr 17:29 - Bongo: I don't really like it that place, the actual Tate building really irritates me, but I'll take one for the team
15 Apr 17:29 - Bongo: What about next to the eye?
15 Apr 17:30 - Shaggy: Also fine with me
15 Apr 17:32 - Lora: I feel the same about that building. Fine with jubilee gardens
15 Apr 18:00 - Shaggy: I'm heading over now, will be there in 20
15 Apr 18:02 - Bongo: Cool same
15 Apr 18:02 - Bongo: 20 mins also

16 Apr 22:39 - Owen: So often i spend like an hour on reddit trying to decide which game i want to play and then just end up playing leagues anyway.

17 Apr 01:05 - Tegan: Why does it mention race?
17 Apr 01:05 - Tegan: Help a sister out here
17 Apr 07:25 - Vinay: Many games allow you to select a race - human race, superior khajit (lizard/cat thing), elf, etc etc
17 Apr 07:26 - Sam Roberts: It determines your stats, and how people interact with you
17 Apr 07:26 - Sam Roberts: Self entitlement, chance of getting shot on sight, jumping etc etc
17 Apr 07:29 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: Sam normally goes for 'hot Asian chick'

17 Apr 18:53 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: I think you're basing your opinion entirely on the poster you saw
17 Apr 18:53 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: I know three people who went, all said it was hilarious
17 Apr 18:54 - Tegan: The wrestling looks to be sold out
17 Apr 18:54 - Tegan: Which is a bit of a pity, but I guess predictable
17 Apr 18:55 - Tegan: Although if you guys want to ask if they're selling tickets on the door I might be interested - it does look pretty awesome :)

17 Apr 19:00 - Bongo: Maybe that's why

17 Apr 19:02 - Alex Bunn: It IS so bad its good

18 Apr 12:22 - Owen: I'm gonna go with the second one.  Because it just seems like a string of random letters,  much like programming seems to me at the moment.
18 Apr 12:36 - Bongo: Yoji will make you program three times as fast
18 Apr 12:38 - Bongo: And probably make twice as many mistakes

22 Apr 12:19 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: I asked my Chinese coworker
22 Apr 12:20 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: She says its a literal translation, sounds nicer in Chinese, just a poetic way to say 'please don't walk on the grass'

22 Apr 19:08 - Tegan: Can't make it tonight, but look forward to your reaction o & e
22 Apr 19:08 - Tegan: How was drawing along with Stubbs?

22 Apr 20:47 - Shaggy: What's the surname of the royal family?
22 Apr 20:48 - Sam Roberts: Windsor!!
22 Apr 20:48 - Dave: Like a painful fart
22 Apr 20:49 - Shaggy: Is it? I thought it's just the castle
22 Apr 20:50 - Sam Roberts: Ah I thought it was a trick
22 Apr 20:50 - Sam Roberts: Aren't they technically German?
22 Apr 20:51 - Shaggy: <Media omitted>
22 Apr 21:07 - Shaggy: <Media omitted>
22 Apr 21:35 - Sam Roberts: Mononyms
22 Apr 21:35 - Sam Roberts: Like Madonna
22 Apr 22:26 - Bongo: It's a conspiracy to hide the fact that the Mongols wiped out what is currently known as Western Europe
23 Apr 09:15 - Joe Jarman: üáΩüá™
23 Apr 09:15 - Joe Jarman: Happy st George
23 Apr 09:24 - Tegan: Racist
23 Apr 09:24 - Tegan: :)

23 Apr 12:41 - Alex Bunn: Sound advice shags
23 Apr 12:57 - Shaggy: It's a pub near me, I don't want to take credit for it
23 Apr 17:45 - Shaggy: Eliza, was it you who posted vote swap? Have you seen http://www.swapmyvote.uk? It's basically the same but more choices
23 Apr 17:46 - Angela: It was me - no I haven't seen that
23 Apr 17:46 - Shaggy: Ah sorry
23 Apr 17:46 - Shaggy: All women are the same
23 Apr 17:50 - Angela: It's a nice idea to include more parties, I wonder how many people use it
23 Apr 17:52 - Shaggy: 1000 so far

23 Apr 19:52 - Alex Bunn: Beers at home üçª?
23 Apr 19:53 - Sam Roberts: Beers at home! Just leaving kings kiss
23 Apr 19:55 - Alex Bunn: Gonna leave work in 10
23 Apr 20:44 - Steven: Become a contractor and for those last 3 hours you would have been paid!
23 Apr 20:52 - Sam Roberts: There's so much more than money ste
23 Apr 20:52 - Sam Roberts: Like, uh, job satisfaction?
23 Apr 20:52 - Sam Roberts: Lo
23 Apr 20:52 - Sam Roberts: Lol
23 Apr 22:33 - Steven: 3 hours extra = 3 hours job satisfaction + 3 hours extra pay -> best
23 Apr 22:36 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: My only problem with contracting is everyone where you work will be bitching about you
24 Apr 00:03 - Dave: Pretty sure they're bitching about you anyway mikr
24 Apr 00:03 - Dave: Mike
24 Apr 07:07 - Alex Bunn: Oooo. Burn
24 Apr 09:36 - Bongo: Yea contractors get auto-uninvited to everything
24 Apr 09:37 - Tegan: I really like my contractors. I just can't rely on them to do the work I've asked them to do.
24 Apr 09:37 - Tegan: Maybe I need new contractors....
24 Apr 09:38 - Bongo: Incompetent contractors don't count
24 Apr 09:38 - Tegan: I'm told they are very competent
24 Apr 09:39 - Tegan: They just can't do stuff as awesome as me
24 Apr 09:42 - Bongo: Go contracting tegs!
24 Apr 10:09 - Tegan: Spending my Friday in the cafe of a shiny 'club lab' workspace on the canal near westborne park
24 Apr 10:10 - Tegan: <Media omitted>
24 Apr 10:10 - Shaggy: Oh wow
24 Apr 10:10 - Shaggy: That's inspiring
24 Apr 10:10 - Dave: God
24 Apr 10:10 - Shaggy: Vb is my role model
24 Apr 10:10 - Tegan: Right?
24 Apr 10:11 - Dave: It's such a bland quote too
24 Apr 10:11 - Dave: She's clearly not tried to achieve creative prowess
24 Apr 10:11 - Dave: Or just not worked very hard on it
24 Apr 10:12 - Vanessa: What do you think of that workspace?
24 Apr 10:12 - Vanessa: Besides the quote
24 Apr 10:12 - Tegan: besides the quote, it sends shiny and new
24 Apr 10:12 - Tegan: Seems
24 Apr 10:12 - Vanessa: Yes they have spaces all over London
24 Apr 10:12 - Tegan: It's attached to the Nido, which has gym, foosball, etc
24 Apr 10:13 - Tegan: I don't understand who these entrepreneurs are
24 Apr 10:13 - Vanessa: Oh that's very clever of them
24 Apr 10:13 - Tegan: Who can afford this biz
24 Apr 10:14 - Vanessa: Some of the workspaces are super expensive and I feel the same, what start up can afford ¬£300+ a month
24 Apr 10:14 - Vanessa: But it's the potential network that you can connect to I guess that balances it out
24 Apr 10:14 - Tegan: Right? Also the coffee is less good than average
24 Apr 10:14 - Vanessa: That's is not good
24 Apr 10:15 - Tegan: I guess so - feels like a bit of a veneer to me
24 Apr 10:15 - Tegan: clever business model for the owners though
24 Apr 10:18 - Shaggy: Assuming you mean 300 per month per desk, I don't think that's expensive
24 Apr 10:19 - Tegan: It is if you're just starting out and you're paying rent somewhere
24 Apr 10:19 - Tegan: If you have something already established and have a source of income it's ok
24 Apr 10:21 - Vanessa: Yes that's what I mean by expensive
24 Apr 10:21 - Vanessa: Especially if you're just one person
24 Apr 10:22 - Shaggy: If you're talking about someone with no funds who needs a desk then of course, that's what the library is for. A startup will already have been invested in and for a few people that's good value for manly compared to an actual office
24 Apr 10:23 - Dave: I'm good value for manly
24 Apr 10:23 - Tegan: l I'll
24 Apr 10:23 - Tegan: I meant lol
24 Apr 10:23 - Vanessa: Workspaces offer flexibility compared to renting an actual space that is why people like them
24 Apr 10:23 - Tegan: That makes sense Shaggy - so that's why everyone is swaggering around here
24 Apr 10:24 - Tegan: They have 'investment'
24 Apr 10:24 - Shaggy: Flexibility is not the main point, if you want a flexible work space it's cheaper
24 Apr 10:28 - Vanessa: Flexibility is one of the main selling points for start ups. They don't want to have to go through the whole process of ordering Internet, buying a printer, being stuck in a contract of a year, etc
24 Apr 10:28 - Bongo: Lol @that quote, I'm in a similar workspace filled with silly quotes
24 Apr 10:28 - Vanessa: But there are many other reasons for workspaces
24 Apr 10:28 - Vanessa: A library doesn't offer what a workspace does for someone wanting to start a business
24 Apr 10:29 - Bongo: Worst one is probably "winning means you're willing to go longer, work longer and give more than anyone else" - vince Lombardi
24 Apr 10:29 - Vanessa: Which workspace are you in bongo?
24 Apr 10:29 - Tegan: lol
24 Apr 10:29 - Tegan: There are some hilarious ones in my office
24 Apr 10:29 - Tegan: I'll add to the inspirational quote library tomorrow
24 Apr 10:29 - Bongo: I'm in the royal exchange
24 Apr 10:29 - Tegan: No, wait, it's the weekend!
24 Apr 10:30 - Bongo: It's this transition consultancy near bank
24 Apr 10:30 - Vanessa: Never heard of that one
24 Apr 10:31 - Bongo: I got hooked up through Gs
24 Apr 10:31 - Shaggy: Exactly, so workspace is cheap compared to an office
24 Apr 10:31 - Vanessa: But that's what I said
24 Apr 10:31 - Vanessa: Cheap and flexible
24 Apr 10:32 - Shaggy: You said it's expensive
24 Apr 10:32 - Tegan: I love it when everyone is really agreeing, but they think they're arguing
24 Apr 10:32 - Vanessa: Yes it's expensive for many start ups
24 Apr 10:32 - Tegan: expensive if you have no money
24 Apr 10:32 - Vanessa: Exactly
24 Apr 10:32 - Shaggy: That's a dumb thing to say
24 Apr 10:32 - Tegan: Like so many things in life :)
24 Apr 10:32 - Tegan: You're a dumb thing to say
24 Apr 10:32 - Shaggy: Everything is expensive if you have no manly
24 Apr 10:33 - Tegan: lol
24 Apr 10:33 - Vanessa: And sometimes the initial phase is where a coworking space would work because you need to be surrounded by the right people
24 Apr 10:33 - Tegan: Dave's got some of that
24 Apr 10:33 - Vanessa: But you can't because you any afford it
24 Apr 10:34 - Shaggy: Anyway, I might well be in one of those in a few months
24 Apr 10:34 - Vanessa: How come?
24 Apr 10:35 - Shaggy: Have to move to new office, but don't have anywhere to go yet
24 Apr 10:35 - Vanessa: Look at Central Working
24 Apr 10:41 - Vanessa: But if I get a job at Wework then you'll have to sign up there
24 Apr 10:42 - Shaggy: Mateusz is already trying to convince me
24 Apr 10:42 - Shaggy: It's not my decision however
24 Apr 10:43 - Vanessa: Yes but you can still be influential
24 Apr 10:43 - Vanessa: In the decision making
24 Apr 10:43 - Shaggy: Throw my toys out of the pram
24 Apr 10:45 - Bongo: Put ketamine in the coffee jar
24 Apr 10:46 - Tegan: Will that help?
24 Apr 10:46 - Alex Bunn: "I love it when everyone is really agreeing, but they think they're arguing" - classic shaggy
24 Apr 10:46 - Alex Bunn: I know tegan said it. But suma shaggy up well
24 Apr 10:47 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: Shaggy : WFHPARTY
24 Apr 10:47 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: That would be cheap
24 Apr 10:51 - Tegan: funsies :)
24 Apr 12:33 - Owen: Smart phones ruined arguments with shaggy.
24 Apr 12:33 - Owen: They used to be so much fun, but now I can prove him wrong in seconds.
24 Apr 12:46 - Tegan: http://www.stylist.co.uk/life/the-most-popular-emojis-by-country-from-france-to-australia?utm_source=Emerald+Street&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=5613411_ES+240415&dm_i=25MN,3CBC3,GBZ2RB,BYY7Q,1
24 Apr 12:46 - Tegan: emoji research on a large scale

24 Apr 13:13 - Alex Bunn: Good headlines üòäüí©
24 Apr 13:23 - Tegan: Now I can't tell what nationality you are
24 Apr 13:24 - Shaggy: Britons?
24 Apr 13:24 - Tegan: Sorry, is that racist?
24 Apr 13:26 - Shaggy: I don't need smartphone to prove you wrong, Owen, just an egg
24 Apr 13:27 - Tegan: he he. Is that one of the defining moments of your life, Owen?
24 Apr 14:15 - Owen: Unfortunately so. That time I rescued a baby from a burning building is overshadowed by a small egg mishap.
24 Apr 18:09 - Bongo: <Media omitted>
24 Apr 18:28 - Owen: Hahahha
24 Apr 18:28 - Owen: Thats great
24 Apr 18:28 - Owen: üòÇüòÇüòÇ

24 Apr 18:35 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: are great, I don't know
24 Apr 18:38 - Bongo: I concur
24 Apr 18:38 - Bongo: Also, have you been messing around with autocorrect again shag?
24 Apr 18:38 - Bongo: "Pig, the dog, interviews Scarlett johansen"
24 Apr 18:38 - Bongo: I think it's actually legit this time
24 Apr 18:42 - Tegan: lol
25 Apr 13:08 - Alex Bunn: Currently at a boozy brunch in the city

25 Apr 13:39 - Alex Bunn: Moved on to the mimosas
25 Apr 13:40 - Sam Roberts: How late is it unlimited for? Could swing by in an hour or so!
25 Apr 13:49 - Shaggy: We can host bloody marys here, just need vodka and tomato juice üòÅ
25 Apr 13:53 - Alex Bunn: I dunno. Our sesh finishes at two
25 Apr 13:53 - Alex Bunn: 2 hour time limit
25 Apr 13:54 - Shaggy: Oh lol
25 Apr 13:54 - Shaggy: So it's not unlimited
25 Apr 13:56 - Alex Bunn: Its unlimited for two hours!
25 Apr 14:02 - Sam Roberts: That would be really bad for my health
25 Apr 14:02 - Sam Roberts: I'm in

27 Apr 14:56 - Bongo: Lol
27 Apr 14:56 - Bongo: You do realise the speed dating is individual, it's not going to be all four of us chatting up a girl
27 Apr 14:56 - Alex Bunn: We can be bad speed dates to make you look good by comparison
27 Apr 14:57 - Bongo: Oh I see what you mean
27 Apr 14:57 - Bongo: Yea awesome
27 Apr 15:01 - Owen: Hi,  I'm Owen, I have syphilis and like long walks in the abattoir.

27 Apr 15:14 - Alex Bunn: Done
27 Apr 15:14 - Bongo: Hi I'm Bunn, the best thing about living with my mum is that she lets me play computer games all day and doesn't complain about not washing myself
27 Apr 15:18 - Tegan: Sometimes I let her wash me
27 Apr 15:20 - Bongo: 10 points if you bring 3 toy dinosaurs with you and put them on your desk facing her
27 Apr 15:20 - Owen: To be fair if a girl did that to me that would be an instant win for her.
27 Apr 15:20 - Bongo: Yea true
27 Apr 15:21 - Owen: Swoon.
27 Apr 15:21 - Bongo: I think we're a lot nerdier than average though
27 Apr 15:22 - Owen: Nerdyness is kinda cool now though.
27 Apr 15:25 - Owen: Technology is in everyones pockets so not knowing how to use it is a bit meh.
27 Apr 15:26 - Owen: When we were younger it was nerds that could do computer stuff because no one else really used them. But now thats changed. It's the new version of being handy.

28 Apr 17:59 - Hannah Murphy: Krizia left?!?
28 Apr 17:59 - Hannah Murphy: I've got dins with my fam tonight but tell us how Kurt cobain is
28 Apr 18:00 - Shaggy: Kicked for inactivity

28 Apr 19:52 - Alex Bunn: Kurts dead fyi

28 Apr 19:57 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: Lol, Kurt faked his death and went undercover disguised as a Mexican girl
28 Apr 19:58 - Bongo: The perfect cover
28 Apr 20:05 - Lorna: Damm guys you just ruined the film!

29 Apr 14:09 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: I just heard the worst joke ever
29 Apr 14:09 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: What are the 10 letters of the pirate alphabet?
29 Apr 14:11 - Joe Jarman: Arrrrggggh

29 Apr 14:13 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: R, I I, and the seven Cs

29 Apr 14:14 - Joe Jarman: That  is pretty shit
29 Apr 14:15 - Alex Bunn: Whats a pirates favourite crime?
29 Apr 14:15 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: Arrrrson?
29 Apr 14:15 - Alex Bunn: Yes
29 Apr 14:15 - Alex Bunn: Also, piracy
29 Apr 14:15 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: Haha
29 Apr 14:17 - Alex Bunn: Related: why does it take pirates so long to learn the alphabet?
29 Apr 14:17 - Alex Bunn: Because they spend years at "C"
29 Apr 14:18 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: <Media omitted>
29 Apr 14:18 - Joe Jarman: Why don't pirates go to strip clubs?
29 Apr 14:18 - Alex Bunn: Lol, why?
29 Apr 14:19 - Joe Jarman: Coz they already have all the booty!
29 Apr 14:19 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: I lol'd

29 Apr 14:25 - Joe Jarman: Hahaha
29 Apr 14:25 - Alex Bunn: I love that you've spent 5mins trying to find a pirate gag worth sharing
29 Apr 14:25 - Alex Bunn: üëç

29 Apr 14:40 - Lorna: Arrrrgos
29 Apr 14:41 - Shaggy: What's a pirate's favourite football team
29 Apr 14:43 - Alex Bunn: Arrrsenal?
29 Apr 14:45 - Shaggy: That's a trick question. They don't have time for such nonsense between raping and pillaging
29 Apr 16:48 - Owen: You're thinking of mongols
29 Apr 16:54 - Bongo: <Media omitted>
29 Apr 16:58 - Bongo: That's meant to be the expression of not being impressed
29 Apr 16:58 - Bongo: But, Mongol as they are, that could also be the look of rape and pillaging
29 Apr 17:02 - Dave: He's being raped in that very picture
29 Apr 17:02 - Dave: Just not a very impressive rape
29 Apr 17:03 - Mike Joyce: He's just seen and done it all
29 Apr 17:04 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: *them all
29 Apr 17:36 - Mike Joyce: No to him we are nearly it
29 Apr 17:45 - Alex Bunn: Yo who's coming for an LB beer?
29 Apr 18:17 - Shaggy: Got dinner plans
29 Apr 18:23 - Mike Joyce: No shaggy LB stands for legally binding...it cannot be refused
29 Apr 18:24 - Shaggy: A trick question, touch√©
29 Apr 18:27 - Mike Joyce: Your mistake was being born....you technically entered the contract at that point.
29 Apr 18:29 - Bongo: That's the conservative political slogan for poor people
29 Apr 18:32 - Mike Joyce: Ha ha....Allong with classic ones like "you are all my slaves" and surrender your children unto bielzibub
29 Apr 18:34 - Joe Jarman: Been and gone, check you on the flipside
29 Apr 18:34 - Joe Jarman: üáßüá∑üöóüë±.......üöì

1 May 08:50 - Shaggy: #boardgames4lyf
1 May 08:51 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: In seriousness I might be up for board games
1 May 09:39 - Bongo: That was a quick turnaround
1 May 09:40 - Alex Bunn: <Media omitted>
1 May 09:40 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: I like sassing Owen more than I like board games
1 May 09:45 - Owen: You know how to turn me on.
1 May 09:45 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: wat
1 May 11:38 - Alex Bunn: Grooveshark shut down apaz. Frontpage reddit
1 May 11:51 - Bongo: I've only just noticed the Asian emoji
1 May 11:51 - Bongo: üë≤
1 May 11:51 - Bongo: That's so mega racist
1 May 11:52 - Owen: üë≥
1 May 11:55 - Tegan: is it more racist to depict an Asian, or to not have an option for Asian people who want to express themselves as emoji?
1 May 11:55 - Tegan: Asians are not the prophet mohammed
1 May 11:56 - Tegan: I don't really feel adequately represented by this lady üôé
1 May 11:58 - Shaggy: üëπ this represents me well
1 May 12:00 - Bongo: It's the slanted eyes that makes it racist though
1 May 12:01 - Bongo: Also where's the black emoji?
1 May 12:02 - Bongo: I bet they were like "okay so for the other races we have a different skin colour and something distinguishable about the race, so what distinguishing feature about black people should we include on the emoji..."
1 May 12:03 - Alex Bunn: üí© here's the black guy
1 May 12:04 - Alex Bunn: Oh no he dint!
1 May 12:04 - Shaggy: There are actually new emoji that include all shades of white
1 May 12:05 - Shaggy: And lol @ bunn's comment
1 May 12:09 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: Emoji were set by the japanese
1 May 12:09 - Bongo: Ah, they hate black people more than anyone
1 May 12:10 - Owen: Wow.  There isn't a black emoji!
1 May 12:10 - Bongo: That makes üë≤marginally less racist
1 May 12:10 - Bongo: But what about üåö
1 May 12:12 - Jimena: üë≤ doesnt have slanted eyes. What makes u think he is chinese?
1 May 12:12 - Bongo: And I feel üë®is misrepresenting pesos everywhere
1 May 12:12 - Jimena: üë≤üèø
1 May 12:12 - Bongo: *pedos
1 May 12:12 - Bongo: The eyes are narrowed
1 May 12:12 - Bongo: You have to look real close
1 May 12:13 - Alex Bunn: He's squinting!
1 May 12:13 - Alex Bunn: Thats the squinting emoji
1 May 12:13 - Bongo: Plus the cap is a traditional Chinese hat
1 May 12:13 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: Japan definitely hate China
1 May 12:13 - Jimena: Tourist?
1 May 12:13 - Bongo: That's definitely a possibility
1 May 12:14 - Bongo: "Squinting tourist"
1 May 12:14 - Bongo: Although that's rather specific for an emoji
1 May 12:14 - Jimena: Lol
1 May 12:14 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: Do emoji look the same on Android / iPhone?
1 May 12:14 - Bongo: If they have "squinting tourist" why the hell don't that have Asian people?!
1 May 12:14 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: <Media omitted>
1 May 12:15 - Bongo: Yea looks the same to me
1 May 12:16 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: I don't know who makes the pictures, like there's those weird yellow blob ones on some apps
1 May 12:16 - Jimena: Noo looks different
1 May 12:16 - Jimena: How do u make screen shots
1 May 12:17 - Bongo: Do you have an iPhone?
1 May 12:17 - Jimena: Yeah
1 May 12:17 - Bongo: Top right button and centre circle button at the same time
1 May 12:17 - Bongo: <Media omitted>
1 May 12:18 - Jimena: <Media omitted>
1 May 12:18 - Owen: Hahaha
1 May 12:18 - Bongo: Wtf!
1 May 12:18 - Owen: That's creepy as fuck.
1 May 12:19 - Jimena: My black squinting touris is an asian and an alien for martyn..
1 May 12:19 - Bongo: Lol wait a second
1 May 12:19 - Bongo: Yea lol
1 May 12:20 - Jimena: Kudos to u for asking if we are all seeing the same thing
1 May 12:20 - Jimena: That was a real philosophic move
1 May 12:20 - Bongo: Your Asian dude doesn't have slanted eyes as well
1 May 12:20 - Jimena: üëçüèø
1 May 12:20 - Bongo: It is very philosophic
1 May 12:21 - Bongo: Maybe in real life some people don't see black people, but an Asian dude with an alien standing next to him
1 May 12:21 - Jimena: Btw that emoji is meant to be a black thumbs up
1 May 12:21 - Bongo: That would explain a lot of the racial hate that's been going on
1 May 12:22 - Jimena: But maybe ur phone is reading it as a a penis and an alien
1 May 12:22 - Bongo: Don't worry it's a thumbs up and an alien
1 May 12:23 - Jimena: üí© and this one is an ice cream
1 May 12:48 - Alex Bunn: So naive
1 May 12:51 - Tegan: Wow.  IPhone Asian is bright yellow!
1 May 12:51 - Tegan: I think Android asian is an improvement.  even with the slanted eyes
1 May 12:53 - Angela: http://fueled.com/blog/new-racially-diverse-emoji-will-create-controversy-solve/
1 May 12:54 - Angela: iPhone has all the emoji of the rainbow on ios8.3
1 May 12:54 - Angela: And lots of emoji are different it turns out!
1 May 12:55 - Angela: http://m.huffpost.com/us/entry/5530638
1 May 12:55 - Angela: On android I mean
1 May 13:10 - Alex Bunn: Good research
1 May 13:14 - Shaggy: As Colbert said: "I don't see race anymore, I just imagine everyone is white and everything ok"
1 May 13:16 - Alex Bunn: Everythink ok indeed
1 May 13:16 - Alex Bunn: Word good
1 May 16:46 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: Ran my emoji code again
1 May 16:46 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: <Media omitted>
1 May 16:46 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: Hannah and Owen and their shenanigans
1 May 16:46 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: Also while I'm at it, sorry Bunn I've overtaken you
1 May 16:47 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: <Media omitted>
1 May 16:49 - Owen: What is the second one Mike?
1 May 16:50 - Lorna: How gay you are?
1 May 16:57 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: Woops
1 May 16:58 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: <Media omitted>
1 May 16:58 - Alex Bunn: Its ok. Iv moved onto witty puns
1 May 16:58 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: I'm pretty sure if Adimina had stuck around she would have doubled the record with selfies alone
1 May 17:05 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: Quiz question : how many posts do you reckon there have been on this group?
1 May 17:05 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: Multiple posts in a row from one person count as 1
1 May 17:05 - Owen: 15,000
1 May 17:10 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: Damn close. This is the 15,556th post
1 May 17:19 - Owen: Nice.
1 May 17:20 - Tegan: When did Owen and Hannah have their brass instrument off?
1 May 17:26 - Alex Bunn: I was thinking that!
1 May 17:27 - Bongo: Lol I'd pay to see that
1 May 17:50 - Shaggy: Any beer plan tonight?
1 May 18:33 - Tegan: negatory- boating tonight
1 May 19:40 - Lorna: So what's the deal with brunch places doing unlimited bloody Marys? Anyone know a good one? And want to go sometime soon?
1 May 22:06 - Dave: Don't know. No. Yes.
2 May 17:33 - Tegan: While festival shopping, Dave just applied the logic: what would Bunn do?
2 May 17:34 - Tegan: You should be proud, man
2 May 18:14 - Dave: We got a load of rum
4 May 11:57 - Alex Bunn: Haha awesome
5 May 10:37 - Lorna: Is anyone planning to stay up and watch the election results? Sick days on Friday!
5 May 10:40 - Tegan: we did that last time when there was likely to be a hung parliament
5 May 10:40 - Tegan: Long night
5 May 10:42 - Lorna: Worth it? There's pubs staying open, and serving early breakfasts..
5 May 10:43 - Owen: The counting lasted until about 10 the next morning last time. I will probably just wake up and pay attention to it during the day.
5 May 13:41 - Dave: I'm thinking the same. Hung parliament and hungover doesn't sound like a good friday
5 May 13:51 - Tegan: What time does the coverage start though?  I'm up for ending the evening in a left leaving pub for sure
5 May 13:51 - Tegan: seeing how things stand at bed o clock
5 May 14:10 - Lorna: Voting closes at 10, and counting starts straight after that, not sure when the first results come in though
5 May 14:12 - Lorna: Also, hoping the pub will not be left leaving at the end of the night!
5 May 15:37 - Tegan: Now that I look at it, I'm really not sure what that would mean. .
5 May 16:06 - Shaggy: I assume you wanted to type "leaning"
5 May 16:36 - Tegan: Thanks shags
5 May 19:17 - Dan Sluckin: I was hoping to find a bar that is showing coverage, perhaps with a swingometer. Is there anywhere central?
5 May 19:18 - Dan Sluckin: Westminster?
5 May 19:18 - Shaggy: Probably inside
5 May 19:30 - Owen: Let's make our own swingometer
5 May 21:07 - Jimena: <Media omitted>
5 May 21:11 - Dave: ‚ò∫
6 May 10:18 - Jimena: So im making a sort of app with a wheel of fortune type thing. The idea is it should be something u could have up on a screen in a pub. Customer pays say 2 quid and gets to have a spin
6 May 10:19 - Jimena: My question is what should the different wheel outcomes be?
6 May 10:20 - Jimena: I was thinking for example 'Headshot: you get the nastiest shot in the bar'
6 May 10:21 - Jimena: 'Showtime: bartenders perform some silly dance song'
6 May 10:21 - Jimena: Any ideas? I feel quite uninspired
6 May 10:23 - Shaggy: It's too early in the morning, I think I need a couple headshots for inspiration
6 May 10:34 - Jimena: Really? Cuz the nastiest shot i ever had was an Abortion: vodka and tabasco. Shall i get u a couple?
6 May 10:41 - Bongo: Surely that's just a mini Bloody Mary
6 May 10:41 - Bongo: I'm up for that
6 May 10:41 - Shaggy: Ugh shot if vodka, no thanks
6 May 10:42 - Bongo: Pretty much all the options are going to be about drinking right?
6 May 10:42 - Bongo: How about, "designated driver downs 4 pints"
6 May 10:43 - Bongo: Or everyone with their first name starting with the person who spun the wheel takes a shot
6 May 10:47 - Bongo: Oh wait these are meant to be rewarding for the person spinning
6 May 11:34 - Tegan: Dares are quite good
6 May 11:34 - Tegan: 'Get yourself thrown out of the pub'
6 May 11:35 - Tegan: or scavenger hunt type ones
6 May 11:35 - Tegan: 'Steal a suit's wallet, then buy your friends a drink'
6 May 11:52 - Sam Roberts: I like the mix... Some to get you drunk, some to get you happy, some to get you arrested
6 May 11:53 - Sam Roberts: Needs a jackpot... Win a bottle of wine?
6 May 11:53 - Sam Roberts: New Andreya Triana album out btw, real soulful
6 May 11:54 - Sam Roberts: Oh, if it's a commercial app, should have a pretty boring set as standard, with a content editor tool so pubs can set their own
6 May 11:55 - Sam Roberts: You could probably buy a set of standard graphics to cut out a huge amount of work, e.g. Fireworks on jackpot
6 May 13:10 - Pete Morey: Give ppl a set of icons that they have to draw on their own/each other's hands.  Then you can use those icons on the wheel to preface any 'nominate'  type activity.  Gives an extra interactive element which would work in a pub. I've used similar idea in comedy with a projector + basic frame animation scrolling through the icons.
6 May 13:18 - Owen: Release a pack of wild wolves into the pub and lock the doors, the last person alive gets a free pint.
6 May 13:19 - Shaggy: Of blood
6 May 13:24 - Bongo: That's more of a five quid wheel than two
6 May 13:25 - Owen: You're right bongo. Let's replace the wolves with geese.
6 May 13:26 - Bongo: "Spinner has to become a leader of a cult and sacrifice and overthrow any government of their choosing"
6 May 13:38 - Tegan: spinner could decide what animal gets released into the pub
6 May 13:39 - Tegan: wolves is like the ¬£20 bonus question
6 May 13:39 - Tegan: other options could be guinea pigs, starlings, spiders
6 May 14:28 - Pete Morey: Hehehe
6 May 17:20 - Jimena: Thank you all for your fantastic suggestions. I had a good laugh reading them
6 May 17:23 - Jimena: The website/app is mot a commercial project. Just a project to add to a little portfolio immaking  to apply for jobs in web development
6 May 17:27 - Jimena: I figured that my combo of degrees in philosophy and education plus my teaching experience wouldnt do the trick
6 May 17:28 - Jimena: Despite some very eloquent motivation letters üò¢
6 May 17:43 - Bongo: Sounds cool, is it a mobile app or web app?
6 May 17:45 - Jimena: Web
6 May 17:45 - Jimena: In javascript
6 May 17:47 - Bongo: We have a coding group on here if you want to join, for any questions, most of us have experience with front end dev
6 May 17:47 - Bongo: I'm pretty new to front end dev myself so it's been really handy
6 May 17:49 - Jimena: Oooh yes please
6 May 17:50 - Jimena: Im pretty new to the whole shebang: wrote my first line of code last dec
6 May 17:51 - Bongo: Ossum, you're probably much better than me in that case
6 May 17:57 - Jimena: Thankyouuuüòé
7 May 07:38 - Dave: Election day! üçÜ
7 May 07:39 - Dave: Did anyone at canning town find my polling card? It was on the fridge when it first arrived then vanished
7 May 08:18 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: Can't see it sorry man, I remember seeing someone's card on the floor, but I'm 99% sure it was Bunn or Sam's
7 May 07:45 - Angela: I don't think you need it
7 May 07:46 - Dave: Having checked it seems i don't. Still would have liked to wave it around.
7 May 07:47 - Alex Bunn: Dont need it
7 May 07:47 - Alex Bunn: Voted üôå
7 May 07:48 - Dave: üëèüåΩ
7 May 07:59 - Owen: Anti-hype
7 May 08:00 - Owen: Go hung parliament! That thing that was meant to happen if we voted AV
7 May 08:01 - Tegan: and then that thing that happened in Belgium where they didn't have a government for the best part of a year
7 May 08:05 - Lorna: Yeah but that's Belgium for you
7 May 08:05 - Owen: To busy eating waffles amiright. Vote UKIP!!
7 May 08:06 - Tegan: They were a'ight
7 May 08:06 - Lorna: Do I get a veg emoji for having just voted?
7 May 08:08 - Tegan: üçç
7 May 08:08 - Tegan: fruit?
7 May 08:09 - Lorna: I'll take that!
7 May 08:11 - Tegan: Have you guys had to queue?
7 May 08:19 - Hannah Murphy: I was tempted to vote for my local "cannabis is safer than alcohol" party but I thought the logo (cannabis leaf) was a bit naff
7 May 08:34 - Angela: Eerily quiet at my polling station, I was the only one in there for a while.... #awkwardvoting
7 May 08:34 - Angela: Should I stay here for a while, read the whole list to make it seem like I'm thinking about it...?
7 May 08:35 - Shaggy: No it would look like you haven't given it thought before
7 May 08:36 - Angela: It's lose-lose for me really
7 May 08:37 - Angela: Can I get a veg now?!
7 May 08:38 - Owen: Vote tactically.
7 May 08:38 - Tegan: üçí
7 May 08:54 - Shaggy: Veg me
7 May 08:56 - Dave: üçÖ
7 May 09:12 - Martha: I voted by postal vote - hoping what happened to Hannah last election doesn't happen to me.
7 May 09:13 - Angela: What happened
7 May 09:18 - Martha: Got a letter afterwards saying her vote didn't count because they didn't believe it was her
7 May 09:19 - Angela: That's so weird. Why wouldn't they?
7 May 09:22 - Martha: Dunno - signature looked a bit different maybe.
7 May 09:41 - Hannah Murphy: I'm creative with my signature every time it would seem
7 May 09:43 - Hannah Murphy: Don't be creative Martha!
7 May 09:43 - Angela: And yet you don't have to show ID when you go and vote...
7 May 09:45 - Tegan: Because you have an address! What greater measure is there??
7 May 10:48 - Tegan: veg!
7 May 10:50 - Shaggy: üêì
7 May 11:50 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: Yikes I didn't realise it was so close
7 May 11:51 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: Ladbrokes odds on who will be next PM: Cameron 10/11, Miliband 10/11
7 May 12:16 - Owen: Owen?

8 May 07:34 - Angela: As soon as he stops sobbing long enough to appear on camera probably
8 May 07:36 - Hannah Murphy: Even if labour had all of the snp's seats, they wouldn't have made a majority

8 May 08:47 - Joe Jarman: Why didn't they just fuck off????
8 May 08:47 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: Bye bye EU?
8 May 08:47 - Joe Jarman: Unbelievable
8 May 08:47 - Tegan: and campaign for independence with them
8 May 08:47 - Joe Jarman: How they vote
8 May 08:47 - Tegan: shit.  referendum
8 May 08:47 - Tegan: shiiiiiiiiit
8 May 08:48 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: I would put money on leaving EU now
8 May 08:48 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: Shiiiiiiit indeed
8 May 08:49 - Shaggy: Only stupid ukip supporters want to leave eu
8 May 08:54 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: I don't think people hate being in the EU, anti-immigration is at a high though
8 May 08:54 - Tegan: Loads of people are stupid
8 May 08:58 - Shaggy: True dat
8 May 08:59 - Shaggy: Did you know 50% of people have iq below average?
8 May 09:01 - Hannah Murphy: Ah well, labour got 5 years to find a decent enough leader to pit against boris Johnson
8 May 09:08 - Tegan: Fancy it Hannah?
8 May 09:28 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: Fucking hell the lib dems too
8 May 09:28 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: I don't know if Clegg can resign
8 May 09:28 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: Who can replace him?
8 May 09:30 - Owen: It really probably doesn't make much difference. Milliband had bought into Cameron's cut everything rhetoric anyway,  so even if he got into power we'd still have a bunch of cuts.
8 May 09:32 - Martha: <Media omitted>
8 May 09:33 - Owen: We need someone like Tony Benn. What happened to politicians like him.
8 May 09:34 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: Owen, what Miliband rhetoric are you talking about?
8 May 09:35 - Owen: Cameron's cut everything rhetoric.
8 May 09:36 - Owen: Milliband bought into it. The debates between them were basically them just promising to cut everything except the NHS
8 May 09:36 - Owen: So if labour got in we'd also just have more "austerity"
8 May 09:43 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: He said that about 2015-2016 I think?
8 May 09:44 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: Nothing long term
8 May 09:44 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: Mad fact - UKIP got twice as many votes as SNP
8 May 09:44 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: 3 million people
8 May 09:45 - Owen: We really need PR. Even if it does mean UKIP get more seats, facts like that just make a mockery of our fptp system.

8 May 13:32 - Bongo: Congrats dude! Sounds like an awesome opportunity
8 May 13:39 - Jimena: Switzerland officially the happiest country on Earth - with Britain lagging in 21st place - The Independent - http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/switzerland-officially-the-happiest-country-on-earth--with-britain-lagging-in-21st-place-10221591.html?cmpid=whatsapp
8 May 13:40 - Jimena: üòÅ
8 May 13:41 - Jimena: Clearly you should all move here.
8 May 13:41 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: 21 out of 158 ain't bad!
8 May 13:41 - Joe Jarman: Most boring country
8 May 13:42 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: Most obnoxious Horde member today üòõ
8 May 13:43 - Joe Jarman: ‚ò∫‚ò∫‚ò∫‚ò∫ so proud
8 May 13:43 - Owen: Over the past three years, 51 per cent of categories measured ‚Äì which included people‚Äôs happiness with their work, health, material wellbeing, relationships, social support and local environment ‚Äìhad improved or shown no change.
8 May 13:44 - Joe Jarman: üèÜ
8 May 13:44 - Owen: This is the kind of subtle propaganda that got Cameron a majority.
8 May 13:44 - Owen: That means 49% of areas happiness went down.
8 May 13:45 - Owen: It doesn't say how many showed no change.
8 May 13:45 - Owen: So it could be 0% happier, 51% no change, and 49% less happy.
8 May 13:45 - Owen: Fuck you independent!
8 May 13:47 - Joe Jarman: I don't think so, it doesn't factor in fear of Scottish people anywhere
8 May 13:51 - Jimena: Tough crowd üòû
8 May 13:51 - Owen: Sorry.
8 May 13:52 - Owen: The newspapers in general have been driving me nuts in the lead up to the election.
8 May 13:54 - Owen: As soon as election season happens, when the papera should try their best to be objective seems to be the time they decide to unashamedly just smear propaganda in your face. No wonder Cameron got a majority, all but one of the major newspapers explicitly supported him.
8 May 13:55 - Joe Jarman: I like your article jimena üòä
8 May 14:03 - Joe Jarman: I bet david likes it too üòç
8 May 14:05 - Hannah Murphy: Anybody looking for a Chinese man ticket?
8 May 14:15 - Jimena: Whatever political propaganda opportunities david or others see in it, it doesnt take away that it is nice to be right at the top of a list that includes 3 nordic countries and canada.
8 May 14:16 - Jimena: üá®üá≠hop suisse!
8 May 14:20 - Tegan: Well done Switzerland!
8 May 14:21 - Tegan: (Have that, Sweden!)
8 May 14:21 - Pete Morey: I gotta say,  I felt the classy civilisation seeping in to my grubby British pores when I visited ye Jim.  That and the cheese.
8 May 14:22 - Owen: I don't have a problem with a happiness report. Just the way the independent covered it.
8 May 14:22 - Tegan: cheese pores
8 May 14:22 - Tegan: mmmmmm
8 May 14:35 - Bongo: Hear hear Owen, shameless propaganda leading up to the election
8 May 14:35 - Bongo: Campaign adverts that imply things that completely contradict the party's policies
8 May 14:35 - Bongo: But it's always been like that
8 May 14:36 - Bongo: Political leaders are becoming like zaphod beeblebrox
8 May 14:38 - Owen: In America money wins elections, in Britain newspapers win elections. I'm not sure which I would prefer, but they are both shit.
8 May 14:44 - Pete Morey: This could be gd critical side-reading to the happiness report.  Ie Is it a good thing in itself to bring wellbeing into policy-tool territory,  where,  once it becomes measurable,  it becomes malleable both in a good and bad way...  (whatever 'it'  is) :

http://www.theguardian.com/media/2015/may/07/how-friendship-became-tool-of-powerful
8 May 14:58 - Owen: However it's used I would rather have a happiness number used to measure progress than the deficit.
8 May 15:13 - Pete Morey: Yeah me too!
8 May 15:26 - Martha: Unfortunately gdp and deficit tell the gov and its lenders how reliably it will be able to pay off its loans. If risk goes up the interest rate can go up or the number of investors can go down, likely leaving the government with less in its purse to spend on welfare services. So deficit and gdp have an indirect impact on progress in that way at least.
8 May 15:27 - Martha: But yes, if you want to measure actual progress and welfare you should look at another indicator, I'm just saying you can't disregard it completely.
8 May 15:29 - Tegan: Let's have lots of indicators
8 May 15:29 - Tegan: much more interesting modeling
8 May 15:30 - Pete Morey: :D
8 May 15:33 - Pete Morey: But highlighting the dangers/limits of wellbeing-as-economic-indicator seems important because it is the most easily co-opted (ie ppl can be duped into following the feel good factor more easily, by a political leader who may be pursuing a darker agenda).
8 May 15:36 - Steven: There are no academic studies to indicate a relationship between financial or media backing and election success. The money and media support flow to the people and parties most likely to win rather than the other way round. There are academic studies that show that relationship.
8 May 15:40 - Pete Morey: That's analogous to what the editor of the Sun said on TV yesterday about their editorial policy in Scotland and England. He seemed like quite a calm,  reasonable and balanced man compared to his headlines,  which somehow directly supported his general point.
8 May 15:41 - Lorna: I agree with your point about money and elections. But with papers I'm not so sure. Murdoch has it in for the labour party, and he controls the majority of the media.
8 May 15:43 - Lorna: ...of the papers anyway. The conservative campaign was strengthened by the argument that labour overspent and would put us back in a recession.
8 May 15:44 - Lorna: That has no factual basis, but it was what Murdoch was reporting. And people will be influenced by that
8 May 17:31 - Steven: This is the only paper I believe.

8 May 17:55 - Sam Roberts: Thanks, made me laugh
8 May 17:56 - Sam Roberts: "Socialism is great in theory, but in practice it‚Äôs a massive ball-ache"
8 May 18:00 - Mike Joyce: Ha ha
8 May 19:09 - Alex Bunn: Joe's inner bastard overflows to his outside
8 May 19:22 - Bongo: It works in small groups with common principles
8 May 19:23 - Bongo: Like the horde, can we just go live on a mountainside somewhere and leave all of this?
8 May 19:39 - Sam Trundell: Like Sweden
8 May 19:59 - Bongo: But we'll call it.. Bongdom
8 May 20:34 - Shaggy: Shangdom
8 May 21:35 - Alex Bunn: Got drunk. Am cycling home. A classic
9 May 21:46 - Shaggy: <Media omitted>
10 May 11:30 - Owen: Blargh guys, blargh.
10 May 11:30 - Owen: I do not remember last night.
10 May 11:31 - Owen: I think I was a bit of a buffoon though.
10 May 11:31 - Owen: Can anyone who was more sober than me offer any insight?
10 May 11:44 - Bongo: Lol you were just happy
10 May 11:44 - Bongo: No particular buffoonery
10 May 11:44 - Owen: I think I said some bad stuff.
10 May 11:44 - Bongo: You were very close to arguing with the bouncers for not being able to take our drink out of the club though
10 May 11:44 - Owen: Really?
10 May 11:45 - Bongo: Yea it's cool though I was just like "bad owen!"
10 May 11:45 - Owen: Oh god. Arguing with emptiers is never a good idea.
10 May 11:45 - Bongo: Haha yea
10 May 11:45 - Owen: Did I try kissing any of you. I think I was in a particularly kissy mood.
10 May 11:46 - Owen: ?
10 May 11:46 - Bongo: lol not me
10 May 11:48 - Owen: Did I reveal any personal information?
10 May 12:23 - Lora: Who loves discooooo? http://www.residentadvisor.net/event.aspx?709077
10 May 12:47 - Bongo: You did mention that one time you took it up the bum and liked it
10 May 12:47 - Bongo: Don't worry we won't tell Eliza
10 May 12:54 - Shaggy: Going to scruff the following night, so I'll probably miss the disco
10 May 13:05 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: Red Arrows fuck yeaaah Óîê

10 May 14:36 - Owen: Bumblebeeee!!!
10 May 14:56 - Sam Roberts: Crazy awesome
10 May 15:47 - Alex Bunn: I am here
10 May 16:03 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: Just in Sainsbury's
10 May 17:47 - Bongo: Wow, haven't been down brick lane in she's
10 May 17:48 - Bongo: *ages
10 May 17:48 - Bongo: Good to know it's still as barmey as always
10 May 17:48 - Tegan: That place be kray
10 May 17:50 - Bongo: I feel really under dressed
10 May 17:50 - Dave: walk on your hands
10 May 17:50 - Bongo: And outnumbered by selfie sticks
10 May 17:51 - Dave: Be ahead of the times - everyone will be doing it soon
10 May 17:51 - Bongo: Lol good call Dave
10 May 17:51 - Bongo: Wish I had thought of that
10 May 17:51 - Dave: That's why you have me
10 May 17:51 - Dave: *cries at the futility of life*
10 May 18:25 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: <Media omitted>
10 May 18:28 - Owen: <Media omitted>
10 May 18:30 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: Mine was better
10 May 18:32 - Owen: I name mine "the despondent mike contemplates his own mortality"
10 May 18:36 - Owen: I call this "sippin' on gin and juice (tonic)"
10 May 18:38 - Owen: <Media omitted>
10 May 18:55 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: Truce lol
10 May 18:55 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: That one of you was funny doe
10 May 19:02 - Shaggy: I'm talking about something really animatedly
10 May 19:41 - Alex Bunn: <Media omitted>
10 May 19:41 - Alex Bunn: <Media omitted>
10 May 19:43 - Tegan: lol
10 May 19:43 - Tegan: Sorry I missed the party y'all
10 May 19:43 - Tegan: Much love to Martita on her birthdita
10 May 19:44 - Tegan: (That's how girls have birthdays in Spanish)
10 May 19:44 - Tegan: x
10 May 19:44 - Owen: It sounds like you are calling Martha a tit.
10 May 20:07 - Hannah Murphy: Tegan - that photo of you bouncing!!!!
10 May 20:07 - Hannah Murphy: I think that's my favourite thing!!
10 May 20:08 - Owen: Hovering.
10 May 20:08 - Owen: Tegan doesn't bounce or jump, she hovers
10 May 20:32 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: She farted
11 May 05:56 - Tegan: it is an amazing thing
11 May 05:57 - Tegan: It is possible that I farted
11 May 10:40 - Bongo: Lol such a good photo
11 May 10:41 - Bongo: I wish I could guff into shot like that
11 May 10:44 - Owen: Should you write not applicable as "na" or "n/a"
11 May 10:45 - Owen: I see it written as "n/a" a lot. But that makes no sense as surely that means not/applicable
11 May 10:51 - Bongo: N/a, I know what you mean it should really be n.a.
11 May 10:52 - Bongo: Na just sounds like a colloquial no
11 May 10:52 - Bongo: Naaaaaaa I mean
11 May 10:53 - Owen: N/a is a tautology. Its either applicable or its not.
11 May 10:53 - Owen: üòÑ
11 May 10:53 - Owen: Not or applicable.
11 May 10:53 - Owen: ! ||==
11 May 10:53 - Owen: Lol nerd bants!
11 May 11:03 - Bongo: Wait I thought n/a is saying that it's definitely not applicable
11 May 11:05 - Owen: That's what it's meant to be.
11 May 11:05 - Owen: But the slash completely changes its meaning. A slash normally means or. E.g. Male/female.
11 May 11:06 - Owen: So n/a is almost like it's saying not or applicable, which is nonsense, or hilarious.
11 May 11:22 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: I sometimes write o/w and w/e for otherwise and whatever
11 May 11:22 - Shaggy: w/ means with, while w/o means without
11 May 11:25 - Owen: I have seen w/o i don't think I have seen w/
11 May 11:34 - Eliza: Slash doesn't always mean "or". It can just be used to separate first letters in abbreviations. E.g. n/a w/ w/r/t
11 May 11:40 - Owen: Thats silly, but I am pretty sure you are correct. I just didn't want to look like an idiot writing kids reports with n/a in them.
11 May 11:42 - Eliza: It's no sillier than 1/2 meaning half not 1 or 2. Slash can be different things.
11 May 11:44 - Bongo: Wo wo wo, fractions are a whole different ball game
11 May 11:45 - Owen: Oh I see n/a means "not divided by applicable"
11 May 11:45 - Eliza: Now you've got it!
11 May 11:45 - Bongo: Which in most cases is equal to 3
11 May 11:45 - Owen: Except in the case where it's not
11 May 11:48 - Pete Morey: <Media omitted>
11 May 11:49 - Owen: Haha, I love that cartoon.
11 May 11:50 - Bongo: Lol
11 May 11:55 - Owen: The only thing missing is that the plane then crashes into London killing thousands.
11 May 11:55 - Owen: Gove was worse than incompetent, he was anti-competent.
11 May 11:56 - Owen: If he was incompetent then nothing would have been done, he actively tried his best to put the education system back 20 years.
11 May 12:43 - Lorna: Which means that now he's minister for justice, they'll be hangings.
11 May 12:46 - Bongo: Is he? Ha
11 May 12:47 - Pete Morey: Yup: top priority for Gove= get rid of those pesky human rights
11 May 12:52 - Sam Trundell: Theresa May is already on it
11 May 12:56 - Martha: Thanks for yesterday guapos! Excellent video war. And cake. Excellent cake.
11 May 13:05 - Bongo: Cheers chica, awesome party
11 May 14:05 - Shaggy: Yeah why the hell is that about human rights?
11 May 14:57 - Dave: Hype?
11 May 14:58 - Sam Roberts: Hype!
11 May 14:59 - Shaggy: Hype¬°
11 May 15:12 - Joe Jarman: There's a bunch of lazy socialists lying around at home, hopefully they'll clean up before the providers get home and get those coals black lit!
11 May 15:15 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: I think Niall's getting well into it
11 May 15:15 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: He said he bought steaks and chicken wings
11 May 15:16 - Joe Jarman: üëçüëç
11 May 15:17 - Joe Jarman: Download 1080p!
11 May 15:17 - Joe Jarman: Those chicken wings are worth their weight in gold! Gold I tell thee
11 May 15:18 - Joe Jarman: üëëüçóüëëüçóüëë
11 May 18:11 - Alex Bunn: Hyped
11 May 18:11 - Alex Bunn: Dragons and boobs!
11 May 18:14 - Bongo: Draboobs
11 May 18:50 - Shaggy: I prefer the term boogons
11 May 18:51 - Martha: Heading over now. Anyone there yet?
11 May 18:52 - Sam Roberts: As yis
11 May 18:52 - Sam Roberts: And ready chica
11 May 18:52 - Martha: Sheeeeeet. There as soon as my little legs can peddle me xx
11 May 18:55 - Pete Morey: Shhheeeiiittt...  Omw what times za shew?  Got jerk pork 4 grill
11 May 19:00 - Sam Roberts: Get over broskini
11 May 19:00 - Sam Roberts: Getting the grill on shortly, screening around 9.30?
11 May 19:01 - Pete Morey: Ah kwl,  late showing tonight.  What's a broskini?
11 May 19:02 - Joe Jarman: You handsome
11 May 19:02 - Joe Jarman: üòâ
11 May 19:03 - Pete Morey: :o
11 May 19:17 - Sam Roberts: Someone who isn't here grab some beers please
11 May 19:17 - Sam Roberts: After the ones we're drinking, and the ones we've got on backup, we're all out of beer
12 May 16:25 - Owen: Hi horde. Do any of your workplaces accept year 10 work experience students? Just a week, because the kids that need two weeks you probably wouldn't want. The ones that only need one week are all really nice kids though.
12 May 16:26 - Angela: Mine might
12 May 16:26 - Angela: We have post 6th form interns
12 May 16:26 - Angela: What do they want to do?
12 May 16:27 - Owen: The email didn't say, but if they have left it this late i think they'll be happy with anything.
12 May 16:28 - Owen: I think the idea is that it's shadowing some professional person.
12 May 16:30 - Angela: I think if they came here they'd probably be set some work to do rather than shadowing someone
12 May 16:30 - Eliza: I will take one small child to make me coffee and paint the kitchen please.
12 May 16:31 - Angela: But they would *see* professional people
12 May 17:41 - Shaggy: We don't do babysitting
12 May 17:43 - Hannah Murphy: I can babysit 10 kids if you pay me
12 May 17:43 - Hannah Murphy: ¬£20 an hour per kid
12 May 17:48 - Bongo: Can we get them to work on a new app?
12 May 17:49 - Bongo: What better work experience than to get them to all start their own company
12 May 18:06 - Owen: That's a pretty good idea, but I'm pretty sure the idea is that unless you go to private school you have to learn to serve others. Work experience is there to show kids not to aspire to capital and instead to resign themselves to the fact that their labour is owned by the bourgeoisie. The persuit of capital is only for posh people.
12 May 18:09 - Bongo: Lol that's dark dude
12 May 18:41 - Jimena: Hey Martyn, can I work on a new app üò¨
12 May 18:42 - Owen: You could design us a stamp set üòÑ
12 May 19:02 - Jimena: Me? Do u mean that in a techie way or normal cuz i actually have a stamp making set
12 May 19:04 - Jimena: <Media omitted>
12 May 19:04 - Jimena: Or u can just borrow some of these
12 May 19:04 - Jimena: <Media omitted>
12 May 19:05 - Vinay: ...
12 May 19:05 - Vinay: I want them
12 May 19:05 - Jimena: üòé
12 May 19:09 - Jimena: I also have TONS of stickers. Including glow in the dark and scratch and sniff ones.
12 May 19:09 - Bongo: Scratch and sniff!!
12 May 19:10 - Bongo: Man that brings me back, surely that's not still a thing,
12 May 19:11 - Vinay: Do you also have temporary tattoo stickers?
12 May 19:12 - Vinay: Never heard of/seen scratch and sniff...
12 May 19:13 - Jimena: What?! No scratch and sniff! Teachers used to put them on certificates and stuff when i was a wee lass
12 May 19:14 - Jimena: <Media omitted>
12 May 19:14 - Jimena: They smell like chocolate and other stuff
12 May 19:16 - Vinay: Cool..  So how do I get that racoon, tiger, and wing-eared koala stamp...
12 May 19:17 - Bongo: I had a peanut butter scratch and sniff that gradually started to smell like Tarmac
12 May 19:19 - Vinay: Lol
12 May 19:19 - Vinay: Tarmac doesn't smell that bad though
12 May 19:19 - Bongo: But it doesn't smell like peanut butter
12 May 19:20 - Vinay: Good point üòÖ
12 May 19:20 - Bongo: And so my childhood dreams of a constant supply of peanut butter smell were destroyed
12 May 19:26 - Owen: Jimena, has bongo not told you about our app.
12 May 19:27 - Bongo: I have
12 May 19:27 - Owen: It's that game where you fold paper into three then one person draws the head, one the body, one the legs then you open it out.
12 May 19:28 - Owen: We have added stanps sets so that people don't have to draw thier own eyes and stuff.
12 May 19:30 - Owen: That's what i was suggesting, you could choose a topic and then have your stamp set in the app, if you like that idea. If you want to get into the more technical side of it I could show you the Android end of it, im sure bongo would be willing to show you the Facebook end and if you ask nice Dan could show you the iOS side.
12 May 19:31 - Vinay: Bloody hell, another earthquake in Nepal apparently
12 May 19:35 - Jimena: Aah i see. Yeah that would be fun. Just tell me the image types, size etc
12 May 19:48 - Jimena: Vinay, if you come and pick them up u can have them.
12 May 20:05 - Vinay: üò± when / where?
12 May 20:07 - Vinay: And are you sure? I don't want to take them away if you're fond of them..
12 May 20:53 - Tegan: You have to go to Geneva
12 May 20:54 - Tegan: on a special racoon mission
12 May 20:54 - Tegan: loved the app, guys- Eliza gave us a sneaky preview
12 May 23:00 - Jimena: üòÅ
12 May 23:16 - Alex Bunn: <Media omitted>
13 May 07:40 - Vinay: Oh, Geneva... I will follow you up on that..
13 May 13:05 - Dave: <Media omitted>
13 May 13:24 - Adam Wills: It's the name tag that's impressing me! Ain't nobody gonna deny that is your desk - nice bold font ;)
13 May 13:28 - Vinay: Looks like It can be a Russian dolls thing too
13 May 13:29 - Sam Roberts: Actually he's at Dan Rodrigues Da Costa's desk
13 May 13:39 - Adam Wills: Dave, how many times has Dan told you!? Stop cluttering up his desk with your Russian doll lunch!
13 May 13:40 - Dave: Never! And I'll change all the adjustments on his chair too.
13 May 13:40 - Sam Roberts: üò±
13 May 13:41 - Dave: Uhuh
13 May 13:41 - Adam Wills: takingittoofar
13 May 13:41 - Dave: Eep
13 May 13:42 - Dave: I quite like Dan tbh. Sometimes i sit on his lap and we work together
13 May 13:42 - Adam Wills: And in one fell swoop he just tookittoofartheotherway
13 May 13:43 - Dave: Thank god there is no Dan. It's too complicated with him in my life
13 May 13:45 - Sam Roberts: But the memories you might have had together!
13 May 13:45 - Sam Roberts: The stapling!
13 May 14:38 - Dave: The borrowing of pens!
13 May 17:43 - Owen: Adam, which day are you doing your leaving thing?
13 May 18:22 - Adam Wills: 24th
13 May 19:48 - Owen: Cool. What's the plan.
13 May 19:52 - Dave: It'll be the 25th after Adz spends all of the 24th brushing his teeth and getting ready
13 May 21:59 - Adam Wills: You make a good and fair point Dave, very fair indeed... I will plan for the 23rd then, and arrive on the 24th with very clean teeth (best not to leave it till the 25th as I'll be on a plane)
13 May 22:00 - Dave: Then it's a date
13 May 22:00 - Owen: Even that reply took 2hours and 7 minutes.
13 May 22:00 - Adam Wills: But I do have very clean teeth right now...
13 May 22:01 - Owen: Lol
13 May 22:01 - Adam Wills: I was just thinking of going to the pembury tavern near Hackney central station, for pints and pizza for the afternoon - simple and easy = best
14 May 13:25 - Alex Bunn: Whats the name of the pub in LB next to the river?
14 May 13:35 - Tegan: the mudlark?
14 May 13:35 - Tegan: does it look like this?
14 May 13:35 - Tegan: <Media omitted>
14 May 13:35 - Tegan: ha
14 May 13:35 - Tegan: thursday
14 May 13:49 - Alex Bunn: üò¶üëé
14 May 14:41 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: Not cool

14 May 20:13 - Vinay: Thanks V, will check them out. I've made some ambigrams and it would be great to convert them to stamps
14 May 20:23 - Sam Roberts: What's an ambigram?
14 May 20:24 - Vinay: Um, typically ambigrams are words that read the same thing upside down
14 May 20:24 - Vinay: But it can read something completely different too
14 May 20:27 - Vinay: <Media omitted>
14 May 20:29 - Vinay: <Media omitted>

14 May 20:31 - Vinay: Tegan probably put your phone on table and rotate horizantally on x axis.. Or turn off screen rotation üòÖ

19 May 08:22 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: Did we decide a cinema last night?
19 May 08:32 - Owen: Does anyone know any good pubs near kings cross?
19 May 08:34 - Alex Bunn: Good pubs near kings cross: big chill house
19 May 08:35 - Alex Bunn: The fellow
19 May 08:36 - Alex Bunn: I had my first cycle to work from the new house
19 May 08:36 - Alex Bunn: very underwhelming
19 May 08:37 - Alex Bunn: So short and so safe!
19 May 08:37 - Alex Bunn: Barely broke a sweat and didnt have any life threatening junctions to cross
19 May 08:37 - Alex Bunn: 2/10
19 May 08:40 - Owen: I was confused then, i thought "the new house" was a pub and you were rating said pub based of how hard a cycle to work is from it, which felt like a fairly arbitrary measure.
19 May 08:40 - Owen: Thanks for the suggestions.
19 May 08:58 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: @Bunn - take a detour and cycle round Bank/Monument for a bit
19 May 08:58 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: I think that's my nastiest/fav place to cycle
19 May 08:59 - Alex Bunn: Haha. Maybe i will!
19 May 09:00 - Dave: Owen, Central Station has free pool, cheap beer and a downstairs dungeon
19 May 09:02 - Dave: Simmons bar is nice but small - has good drinks offers til 8 or 9
19 May 09:03 - Owen: Dungeon? Like... Sex.. Dungeon...? My my Dave, I wouldn't have guessed!
19 May 09:03 - Dave: Backpackers is cheap, has a roof garden. Often friendly people there
19 May 09:04 - Dave: Ha, Sam knows more about what happens down there than me
19 May 09:05 - Shaggy: Premier in is cheap but not very atmospheric
19 May 09:07 - Owen: Is that a joke shaggy?
19 May 09:07 - Owen: I'm not taking a date to a premier inn!
19 May 09:07 - Owen: Well not immediately anyway üòâ
19 May 09:07 - Shaggy: That depends what the goal is
19 May 09:22 - Hannah Murphy: Bunn - please do not take cycling advice from Mike
19 May 09:22 - Hannah Murphy: Or do you wanna get all scarred up?
19 May 09:22 - Alex Bunn: Haha. But he rides to the Xtreme
19 May 09:22 - Hannah Murphy: Like a MAN

19 May 09:44 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: <Media omitted>
19 May 09:45 - Alex Bunn: Dorne seriously needs to step up a notch
19 May 09:45 - Alex Bunn: I was super excited at the end of season 4
19 May 09:45 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: Seriously, it's like Hercules blood in the sand
19 May 09:57 - Alex Bunn: I dont know what that is but i assume its shit
19 May 09:57 - Alex Bunn: People are slating that scene on the interwebs
19 May 10:00 - Joe Jarman: It was a bit comic really
19 May 10:00 - Alex Bunn: Cant wait to watch it again tho
19 May 10:07 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: I meant Spartacus woops
19 May 10:07 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: Yeah, is pants
19 May 10:08 - Sam Roberts: You seen it past the first two episodes?
19 May 10:08 - Sam Roberts: It's amazing!
19 May 10:08 - Owen: Spoilers!
19 May 10:09 - Sam Roberts: There's a scene where a guys face gets cut off and his brain falls out
19 May 10:09 - Shaggy: Brain is attached to your spine
19 May 10:10 - Sam Roberts: Not this guy's
19 May 10:10 - Sam Roberts: Hey yeah we didn't decide a cinema
19 May 10:11 - Sam Roberts: Think richmix was the leader though
19 May 10:47 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: I'm easy
19 May 10:47 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: Rich mix showing at 9, still lots of seats free
19 May 11:39 - Sam Roberts: I'm in
19 May 11:39 - Sam Roberts: Climbing first if anyone fancies
19 May 11:51 - Alex Bunn: I would but i think it might chuck it down later
19 May 11:51 - Alex Bunn: ‚òîÔ∏è
19 May 12:05 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: What are people thinking then?
19 May 12:05 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: Not gona hang around til 9 on my own!
19 May 12:22 - Alex Bunn: Tbh i'm out
19 May 12:22 - Tegan: Lize and I were saying we'd be up for it next week
19 May 12:23 - Tegan: This week is looking too busay
19 May 12:25 - Vanessa: Owen there's also Drink, Shop & Do at kings cross. It's not a pub but a nice place
19 May 12:30 - Dave: Just watched a UKIP MEP mess up his speech at the European Parliament.

He ended by saying "yes to the EU, no to the UK" then had to correct himself
19 May 12:31 - Dave: @owen and v - Hausmann's bookshop is also a great kings x shop.
19 May 12:35 - Owen: I think I agree with him.
19 May 12:35 - Owen: Let's start a no to the UK party, lets just become Europe already.
19 May 12:49 - Tegan: lol
19 May 12:49 - Tegan: I bet he was practising all the way there
19 May 12:49 - Tegan: 'no EU, yes UK
19 May 12:50 - Tegan: 'yes EU, no UK'
19 May 12:50 - Tegan: Dammit!
19 May 12:50 - Owen: Lol
19 May 12:53 - Owen: Did you know that the negative externalities and subsidies for fossil fuels equal 6.5% of the worlds GDP. The IMF just published a study, they also say they have probably underestimated because they only looked at directly attributable financially measurable externalities.
19 May 12:56 - Dave: What's the split between subsidies and externalities?
19 May 13:05 - Shaggy: I don't even know what externalities are
19 May 13:07 - Owen: <Media omitted>
19 May 13:07 - Owen: Here's the breakdown Dave.
19 May 13:07 - Owen: It's mainly externalities.
19 May 13:08 - Owen: The article did this annoying thing of calling them both subsidies, I guess because not everyone knows what a negative externality is.
19 May 13:09 - Owen: http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/may/18/fossil-fuel-companies-getting-10m-a-minute-in-subsidies-says-imf?CMP=fb_gu
19 May 13:09 - Owen: That's the article.
19 May 13:09 - Dave: @shaggy - Externalities are costs or benefits which are not accounted for in the market price of a good.
19 May 13:11 - Dave: So the polluting effect of a car would not usually factor into it's price but is a cost to the environment
19 May 13:11 - Dave: This cost can be internalised by adding a tax to the car in terms of how green it is
19 May 13:12 - Dave: Or alterntively it can be culturally internalised by making owning green cars desirable
19 May 13:45 - Owen: What's even crazier is that 6.5% figure comes without including global warming at all!
19 May 18:05 - Lorna: So who's coming to the cinema then? I'm heading to Shoreditch now
19 May 18:06 - Lorna: Or shall we go next week if people prefer?
19 May 18:13 - Sam Roberts: Uhhhhh
19 May 18:14 - Sam Roberts: Mike made me go to canary wharf
19 May 18:14 - Sam Roberts: Come to canary wharf? Just setting off now
19 May 18:15 - Lorna: Pssh. What time's the film there?
19 May 18:38 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: 8, sry thought no one was interested
19 May 18:43 - Sam Roberts: Just got to c&c, anyone want a pint?
19 May 18:58 - Lorna: Its too far to canary wharf, I'm out.
19 May 18:58 - Tegan: Bloody Mike
19 May 19:00 - Sam Roberts: Super quick from Shoreditch, overground to Canada water then 1 stop

25 May 19:39 - Martha: Me too!
25 May 19:39 - Vinay: Me three
25 May 19:44 - Tegan: Awesome news big L - let me know tomorrow
25 May 19:44 - Tegan: cuuuuute
25 May 19:52 - Sam Roberts: All good got lighting fluid v
25 May 19:52 - Sam Roberts: Cheers for looking
25 May 20:51 - Eliza: Sorry, not going to make it. Have a good one!
25 May 21:38 - Joe Jarman: Give her one from us üòâ wheeeey
25 May 23:19 - Owen: Joe, we'd appreciate it if you saved your crass jokes where they belong, which is the opinion page of the sun newspaper.
25 May 23:23 - Joe Jarman: Sorry mate, alll bbqd up. Dear Deidre isn't what it used to be!
26 May 16:18 - Eliza: Owen says one of you (he can't remember who...) was saying something about some course in Greek myth...? What was this?
26 May 16:54 - Shaggy: Age of wonders II, I think it's on sale
26 May 16:57 - Owen: I'm not sure that was it... I swear someone was talking about some online course. I may have misunderstood though.
26 May 16:57 - Tegan: I think it was Sam
26 May 16:58 - Owen: I think it was too.
26 May 16:59 - Owen: @Sam, what was that greek myth thing you were talking about on sunday?
26 May 17:47 - Sam Roberts: Wasn't me on Sunday (out maybe it was, that was a large bottle of rum for one person)
26 May 17:48 - Sam Roberts: I sent it a message a little while back for an mitx online course on Greek myth and culture, I'll try and dig out the link but you can probably find it faster on the mitx or edx website
26 May 17:48 - Sam Roberts: I'm up for it if you fancy a study buddy
26 May 18:05 - Eliza: Ohh very maybe! I'll have a look, I just signed up for an online course on Film Noir as well - so I'll see how it works time wise...
26 May 18:41 - Eliza: The Ancient Greek hero? Or Greeks at war? Or Western Civilisation - ancient and medieval Europe? Is it one of those?
26 May 18:41 - Sam Roberts: Greek hero was the one I was looking at
26 May 18:41 - Sam Roberts: Open to whichever seems most badass though
26 May 18:42 - Eliza: Starting in September? Yes, I would be interested!
26 May 18:42 - Bongo: In myth or irl?
26 May 18:43 - Eliza: In epics and poems. Myth (mostly) I think.
26 May 18:45 - Bongo: What's that one with Eurydice?
26 May 18:45 - Bongo: That dude was a legend
26 May 18:45 - Bongo: And deserves a heavy metal theme tune for going to hell and back
26 May 18:47 - Eliza: The guy with the lyre? Yeah, he's cool. I think the course is mostly about The Iliad (Paris, Achilles, etc...) and Sapho's poems which I am not familiar with.
26 May 18:47 - Bongo: Orpheus
26 May 18:47 - Bongo: Is the guy
26 May 18:48 - Eliza: If anyone is interested in a course of film noir starting in June as well... http://www.openculture.com/2015/05/take-a-free-course-on-film-noir.html
26 May 18:49 - Eliza: Oh yeah, Orpheus was the guy, Eurydice was his lady love.
26 May 18:52 - Dan Sluckin: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_zLcaS76OtM
27 May 15:38 - Joe Jarman: Cinema 2 for 1 code if anyone wants it!
27 May 18:18 - Hannah Murphy: <Media omitted>
27 May 18:22 - Owen: Don't you legally have to offer tap water for free?
27 May 18:23 - Tegan: Cold, though
27 May 18:25 - Owen: Nice. I love cold things. Like winter and hearts.
27 May 18:29 - Hannah Murphy: Apparently it's just a tap with some cups
27 May 18:30 - Bongo: Lol that's so hipster
27 May 18:31 - Bongo: They probably have happy hour competitions to see who can drink their water the most ironically
27 May 18:32 - Bongo: And instead of a tv they just watch the local stray cat licking its balls
27 May 18:34 - Owen: Are you sure it's just tap water? It's not different types of mineral water or something?
27 May 18:53 - Vanessa: That would make more sense. water sommeliers actually exist
27 May 18:53 - Hannah Murphy: No I think it's some kind of thing for charity
27 May 18:53 - Hannah Murphy: To raise awareness of some water charity
27 May 18:57 - Hannah Murphy: On another note -government banning selling/manufacturing of all legal highs
27 May 18:58 - Hannah Murphy: Including laughing gas etcetc
27 May 18:58 - Hannah Murphy: That's a whole generation of 13 year olds won't get to try poppers
27 May 18:59 - Owen: What the hell do they count as a legal high?
27 May 18:59 - Shaggy: Laughing gas has a legitimate use though, what are they going to do about that?
27 May 18:59 - Owen: How will restaurants whip cream?
27 May 18:59 - Shaggy: Surely it doesn't include that
27 May 18:59 - Owen: And how will botanists feed thier plants?
27 May 19:00 - Shaggy: How will they feed their marijuana plants?
27 May 19:00 - Owen: Meow meow was sold as plant food.
27 May 19:02 - Shaggy: It was although it wasn't actually used for that purpose so we safely class it as a legal high
27 May 19:03 - Owen: Agreed, but how will the government know that the next plant food that gets released isn't a legal high?
27 May 19:06 - Shaggy: Well you could look at the chemical composition, so if it looks like MDMA, behaves like MDMA but is plant food then I'd argue it's probably not really plant food
27 May 19:08 - Shaggy: I would also argue that if we know that it's not plant food then so does the government
27 May 19:09 - Owen: Oh they would know, I'm just not sure how they legally prove it is.
27 May 19:47 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: Meh. Legal drugs. Meh.
27 May 19:47 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: The secret ingredient is crime anyway
27 May 19:48 - Dave: How about glue?
27 May 19:50 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: What about auto-asphyxiation?
27 May 19:50 - Shaggy: Only if it's erotic
27 May 19:52 - Owen: What about looking at the sun too long? Are the government gonna ban that too?
27 May 20:19 - Dave: Only for the poor
27 May 21:37 - Jimena: Btw: u guys heard about GoT: the musical? https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=RfI_mUIvYq8#
27 May 23:32 - Shaggy: Yes, it's great!
28 May 01:05 - Bongo: Heard it, amazing.
28 May 01:44 - Owen: Watching Dwyane "the rock" Johnson act is like watching Dwyane "a rock" Johnson act.
28 May 01:44 - Owen: Don't tell Phil I said that!
28 May 16:51 - Vanessa: Phah! Sepp Blatter says he's not responsible for the corruption. What a hoot
28 May 17:34 - Alex Bunn: Haha. He has to go!
28 May 17:36 - Alex Bunn: I think this corruption exposure is well timed considering he's put himself up for re-election despite promising he was gonna step down
28 May 17:36 - Alex Bunn: Its just a shame that Luis Figo dropped out of the presidential race
28 May 17:37 - Alex Bunn: Blatter wont fall on his sword tho
28 May 17:42 - Vanessa: I'm really hoping something good comes out of this. The U.S. is really taking this seriously and the change in legislation in Switzerland has enabled the Swiss authorities to actually act
29 May 14:34 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: http://www.zeit.de/sport/2015-05/sepp-blatter-all-reasons

29 May 14:57 - Shaggy: Sepp
29 May 15:01 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: I think it might be better for FIFA to collapse completely
29 May 15:02 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: Sepp winning would be conducive to that
29 May 16:34 - Dave: Anyone for a pint? I may leave work early
29 May 17:04 - Alex Bunn: Fitzrovia?
29 May 17:06 - Shaggy: I'm down for a pint
29 May 17:08 - Tegan: I'm on for about 6.30
29 May 17:28 - Dave: Frizrovia could work. Ibwas thinking kings x
29 May 17:31 - Dave: I'm gonna head to King's x. Hope that suits peeps
29 May 17:37 - Shaggy: Going to have a couple near work, will see how it goes after
29 May 18:19 - Owen: <Media omitted>
29 May 18:28 - Tegan: I think gyms are safe
29 May 18:29 - Tegan: similar effect could be attained with a marker pen, and it would be much more portable
29 May 18:44 - Vinay: Haha that's brilliant
29 May 19:17 - Alex Bunn: üòÇ

1 Jun 11:46 - Alex Bunn: We're ahead of the books on that arc üòú

2 Jun 11:41 - Jimena: Dont know the thick of it. W
2 Jun 11:41 - Jimena: Whats it about?
2 Jun 11:45 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: The thick of it is the original comedy set in Westminster that Veep is based on

2 Jun 20:25 - Hannah Murphy: Sepp you Blatter, alligatter!

3 Jun 22:39 - Dave: Nope
3 Jun 22:39 - Dave: Not a concept with which a perceive the world
3 Jun 22:50 - Shaggy: I know it very well
4 Jun 10:11 - Owen: Phew, I almost just made a ¬£100 mistake on a circuit board design. Lesson: check everything 10 times before spending money.

4 Jun 20:55 - Bongo: I always though that place was missing a helicopter
4 Jun 22:29 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: That would be such a great google map get
5 Jun 07:25 - Jimena: <Media omitted>
5 Jun 07:26 - Jimena: No special rights for immigrants. Political campaign against voting rights for immigrants in bern, switzerland
5 Jun 07:27 - Jimena: The party 'udc' is famous here for all kinds of outrageous posters
5 Jun 07:28 - Vinay: Wow..
5 Jun 07:29 - Vinay: Where is the third guy from?
5 Jun 07:29 - Jimena: <Media omitted>
5 Jun 07:30 - Vinay: That's a bit too... Nationalist?
5 Jun 07:30 - Shaggy: Third guy looks Georgian
5 Jun 07:31 - Vinay: Oh, I was guessing Russia or Poland
5 Jun 07:33 - Jimena: <Media omitted>
5 Jun 07:34 - Jimena: Considering immigrant populations here i would say he is either eastern european or arab
5 Jun 07:35 - Jimena: Its a super racist nationalist party
5 Jun 07:37 - Jimena: The funny thing with the last poster is that the supposed ivan is actually a swiss guy, not a known rapist and they took his photo from the internet without asking
5 Jun 07:38 - Alex Bunn: Third guy is a jew
5 Jun 07:38 - Shaggy: You mean Israeli, yes that's possible
5 Jun 07:48 - Lorna: Did anyone else just hear the DJ Yoda mash up of radio 4 sounds?
5 Jun 07:53 - Angela: Yeah!
5 Jun 07:54 - Angela: How random was that!
5 Jun 07:54 - Angela: "And now here's thought for the day"
5 Jun 07:55 - Lorna: Yeah that was pretty funny!
5 Jun 08:03 - Owen: The third guy is clearly Borat!
5 Jun 10:42 - Jimena: So what would be your ethnic stereotype?
5 Jun 10:43 - Jimena: <Media omitted>
5 Jun 10:47 - Shaggy: <Media omitted>
5 Jun 10:50 - Jimena: Where is he from?
5 Jun 10:50 - Jimena: Awesome hair and moustache
5 Jun 11:06 - Owen: <Media omitted>
5 Jun 11:08 - Hannah Murphy: OMg shaggy so that's what you were trying to do with that moustache last Christmas
5 Jun 11:09 - Shaggy: Trying? I nailed it
5 Jun 11:09 - Hannah Murphy: Well done you for trying
5 Jun 11:12 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: Haha, burn
5 Jun 11:13 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: He looks like a character from Asterix
5 Jun 11:13 - Shaggy: That's your authentic Ukrainian Cossack, not some stupid gall
5 Jun 11:13 - Shaggy: Gaul
5 Jun 11:16 - Dave: <Media omitted>
5 Jun 11:27 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: What stereotype is that?
5 Jun 11:27 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: Tegan, you'd better not be on the egg council
5 Jun 11:27 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: <Media omitted>
5 Jun 11:27 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: <Media omitted>
5 Jun 11:53 - Dave: Sorry, misunderstood the brief. I guess when i saw shaggys picture i took the idea to be how you would best represent your soul. Ergo egg.
5 Jun 11:57 - Tegan: xx
5 Jun 11:59 - Shaggy: I think restaurants should reward wastelessness (let's assume it's a word) by giving discounts to customers who finish their food. Or vice versa, penalise those who waste it
5 Jun 12:00 - Tegan: I think restaursnts should offer smaller portions and then the possibility of seconds
5 Jun 12:01 - Angela: We could ponder over the seconds menu
5 Jun 12:01 - Angela: And then decide we'd better not
5 Jun 12:01 - Shaggy: Also good
5 Jun 12:01 - Tegan: Would be great!
5 Jun 12:02 - Tegan: or charge the same price for a smaller meal with optional seconds
5 Jun 12:02 - Tegan: You know, for boys
5 Jun 12:03 - Dave: That's something i could get behind. Double dinner!
5 Jun 12:03 - Dave: üåΩ then üçÜ
5 Jun 12:03 - Vanessa: That's what doggy bags are for, to not waste your food
5 Jun 12:03 - Tegan: üåµ
5 Jun 12:03 - Tegan: You just reminded me I have pizza in the fridge!
5 Jun 12:04 - Tegan: Oh happy day!
5 Jun 12:04 - Angela: Ooh seconds in a doggy bag would be great!
5 Jun 12:04 - Vanessa: Maybe it's not practiced much  here
5 Jun 12:04 - Angela: Would avoid that problem of already having eaten all the best bits
5 Jun 12:04 - Tegan: Some places not others
5 Jun 12:04 - Tegan: true
5 Jun 12:04 - Dave: üçïwin
5 Jun 12:04 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: Why's it called a doggy bag?
5 Jun 12:05 - Angela: Maybe some people give it to the dog?
5 Jun 12:08 - Shaggy: They are not compulsory. I'm not worried about me wasting food, it's others
5 Jun 12:09 - Owen: Restaurants should just have a pit of lizards out back and then throw scraps to said lizards.
5 Jun 12:09 - Owen: You could also throw unruly customers into said pit.
5 Jun 12:09 - Angela: Maybe there could be doggy bagging rights at restaurants - if you see a plate of unfinished food from another table you should be able to claim it
5 Jun 12:09 - Shaggy: That's again, wasteful
5 Jun 12:10 - Owen: Not if you one day ride the lizards into battle
5 Jun 12:10 - Shaggy: What about cooties? That's unsanitary
5 Jun 12:10 - Dave: Yes Angie. I always want to finish food on other tables but tegan says it's not the done thing
5 Jun 12:10 - Angela: Let's start a campaign!
5 Jun 12:10 - Shaggy: Doggy and bagging. Are we still talking about food?
5 Jun 12:11 - Angela: Campaign for doggy bagging
5 Jun 12:11 - Dave: I remember spending a long 10 mins staring at someone's uneaten chunky chips in a pub debating whether i could take them
5 Jun 12:11 - Dave: Sadly i did not
5 Jun 12:11 - Dave: A decision is regret to this day
5 Jun 12:12 - Angela: You should carry around some Tupperware. Once it's in your Tupperware all cooties disappear and that's science
5 Jun 12:12 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: Surely you can only get a doggy bag if you already bought food
5 Jun 12:12 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: Otherwise that's bad business
5 Jun 12:13 - Shaggy: Nah I think that's fair too
5 Jun 12:13 - Shaggy: I like what pret do, I just wish they didn't brag about it so much
5 Jun 12:13 - Angela: Just because I've bought food, doesn't stop me wanting to eat everyone else's food
5 Jun 12:13 - Dave: You could pay for the right to take others food. It's like a buffet of other people's food.
5 Jun 12:13 - Shaggy: But mega cheap
5 Jun 12:13 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: Yeah but if you haven't bought food you can't take someone elses
5 Jun 12:14 - Shaggy: Cos otherwise it goes to ducking lizards
5 Jun 12:14 - Tegan: in other countries, they take food you haven't eaten (breads etc) and put it straight on other people's tables
5 Jun 12:15 - Tegan: of course, instances of vommunicable disease are much higher in those countries. ..
5 Jun 12:15 - Tegan: lol
5 Jun 12:15 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: Lol
5 Jun 12:15 - Tegan: communicable
5 Jun 12:15 - Shaggy: I think we should collectively start a restaurant of international food, where all waiters are stereotypes and then we can test these ideas. We can even get a lizard pit
5 Jun 12:15 - Angela: Lol diseases
5 Jun 12:17 - Owen: Yay! Lizard pit! I'm in. We just need to choose who to ride them into battle against.
5 Jun 12:18 - Shaggy: I think first candidate is Tegan, mostly due to size
5 Jun 12:18 - Shaggy: Or maybe Peter dinklage
5 Jun 12:19 - Owen: No no no, I meant who do we attack, not who rides the lizards. Obviously Tegan and Eliza and V ride the lizards
5 Jun 12:20 - Shaggy: Oh sorry, misread
5 Jun 12:20 - Tegan: lol
5 Jun 12:20 - Tegan: me and Peter dinklage
5 Jun 12:21 - Shaggy: Well, are they nuclear lizards? Maybe Putin?
5 Jun 12:21 - Owen: They are not nuclear lizards, unless litvinyenko visits our restaurant and his scraps get fed to the lizards.
5 Jun 12:22 - Shaggy: I don't want that kind of clientele, that's my one veto
5 Jun 12:23 - Owen: But assassinations are good for business.
5 Jun 12:23 - Owen: As are lizards.
5 Jun 12:24 - Shaggy: Assassinations leave at least one less person to pay
5 Jun 12:24 - Owen: Oh they pay alright!
5 Jun 12:24 - Angela: I'm not sure lizards would attack Putin. He is one of them
5 Jun 12:24 - Owen: Pay with their lives!
5 Jun 12:24 - Shaggy: You grow the lizards but that's not the primary business model
5 Jun 12:24 - Owen: Whaaa??
5 Jun 12:25 - Shaggy: Lizards aren't that discriminatory
5 Jun 12:25 - Shaggy: Step 3 is profit, not global domination
5 Jun 12:25 - Owen: Are we not running a shady lizard farm, did I miss something?
5 Jun 12:25 - Owen: Wow wow wow, wait.
5 Jun 12:25 - Angela: http://www.google.co.uk/imgres?imgurl=https://threehundredsixtyfivethousand.files.wordpress.com/2014/01/7.jpg&imgrefurl=https://threehundredsixtyfivethousand.wordpress.com/2014/01/07/7-lizard-people-putin-fevers-and-what-not/&h=545&w=673&tbnid=p5er_2faUeI7UM:&zoom=1&docid=zXBXkdfmpW_paM&hl=en-GB&ei=JodxVfPHFK_Y7AaC64CgAg&tbm=isch&ved=0CB4QMygAMAA
5 Jun 12:25 - Owen: You are not dreaming big enough dear boy.
5 Jun 12:26 - Shaggy: I have humble aspirations
5 Jun 12:26 - Shaggy: I want a restaurant where people don't waste food
5 Jun 12:27 - Shaggy: That's a good picture but you get a down vote for using a link
5 Jun 12:28 - Angela: www.kissmyass.com
5 Jun 12:28 - Owen: I wish wassap did have up and downvotes. I would have so many downvotes for derailing conversations by ranting about lizards!
5 Jun 12:30 - Shaggy: If a bear and a lizard had a child, it would be Owens wet dream
5 Jun 12:30 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: A blizzard
5 Jun 12:31 - Shaggy: Man I can't believe I missed that
5 Jun 12:31 - Owen: Oh my
5 Jun 12:32 - Shaggy: <Media omitted>
5 Jun 15:05 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: <Media omitted>
5 Jun 15:07 - Owen: That's out of the box thinking.
5 Jun 15:08 - Owen: Airlines hate him. You won't believe this one trick a student used to save money on his flights.
5 Jun 15:30 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: Did you see that story about the dude offering a free round the world trip to any woman with the same name as his ex?
5 Jun 16:35 - Dave: Yeah. They had a good time apparently.
5 Jun 16:35 - Dave: But no schnarf

8 Jun 16:49 - Sam Roberts: Any preferred size? What about those ginger wine bottles?
8 Jun 16:52 - Lorna: No they need caps. 500ml is good. Reckon I only need about 4 litres, so should be easy.

12 Jun 05:57 - Adam Wills: It's great to see you're getting into football Dave!
12 Jun 05:58 - Adam Wills: From what text is included in the picture it looks like Rio Ferdinand is getting 'semi-bookended'... With 'text-book skill'
12 Jun 05:58 - Adam Wills: Urban dictionary defines bookended as 'When, while sitting at a bar, a person is flanked on either side by individuals who have chosen to take out books and read rather than continue a conversation. Also known as a Bilateral Booking.'
12 Jun 05:59 - Adam Wills: ... I guess the mystery continues
12 Jun 06:00 - Adam Wills: Unless Rio has hiding sought after paperbacks up his hidey
12 Jun 07:00 - Tegan: lol

12 Jun 22:27 - Vanessa: It feels like a Caribbean beach bar without the sand
12 Jun 23:04 - Dave: Just read all this - I'd ve amazed if anyone meets anyone tonight at this rate
13 Jun 00:15 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: It was a shambles
13 Jun 10:36 - Shaggy: Spinoza sounds a great guy
13 Jun 14:09 - Sam Roberts: Why?
13 Jun 14:09 - Sam Roberts: The philosopher?
13 Jun 14:09 - Sam Roberts: Which one was Spinoza?
13 Jun 14:10 - Dave: Some rationalist
13 Jun 14:11 - Sam Roberts: He destroyed medieval ethics apparently
13 Jun 14:11 - Sam Roberts: And had a pretty sweet hat
13 Jun 14:11 - Sam Roberts: Hey who got to Dalston yesterday¬ø
13 Jun 14:16 - Shaggy: He tried to rationalise religion, did pretty well in my opinion, although his rabbis wouldn't agree
13 Jun 14:16 - Sam Roberts: Then I disagree with his whole project
13 Jun 14:16 - Sam Roberts: That's like rationalizing art
13 Jun 14:16 - Sam Roberts: You can reach a conclusion, but you've lost the essence of the subject by the time you get there
13 Jun 14:21 - Shaggy: Art fart
13 Jun 14:51 - Dave: Just been reading hus wiki page with Tegs. Seems a nice phikosophy. He's similar to Berkeley in his view of God. He sees thought and substance as being interacting and is against descartes in thinking them different. He doesn't belive in free will and is similar to the Stoics.
13 Jun 15:41 - Dave: üí©

13 Jun 16:38 - Owen: He doesn't have to. He just stops thinking about her?
13 Jun 16:39 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: 'It's not you it's me'
13 Jun 16:40 - Owen: Hahah
13 Jun 22:02 - Dave: <Media omitted>
13 Jun 22:12 - Alex Bunn: Lol

13 Jun 22:36 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: I still think it was my idea
13 Jun 23:50 - Alex Bunn: How on earth did you manage that?!?
13 Jun 23:50 - Alex Bunn: Jokes
14 Jun 01:35 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: We had a dream
14 Jun 07:46 - Adam Wills: This is amazing
14 Jun 07:46 - Adam Wills: FP shaggy and mike
14 Jun 17:36 - Alex Bunn: Do films get cheaper if they've been in the cinema for a long time?
14 Jun 17:37 - Alex Bunn: I think that should be a thing
14 Jun 17:42 - Bongo: Nah don't think so, they're only cheaper if they're crap
14 Jun 17:43 - Alex Bunn: I think they might make more money if they got a bit cheaper once their popularity starts to drop
14 Jun 17:45 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: Planet money did an episode about variable ticket pricing
14 Jun 17:46 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: I remember they made convincing arguments about why they don't, and I don't remember any of them
14 Jun 17:46 - Alex Bunn: Whats planet money?
14 Jun 17:46 - Sam Roberts: Haha I was thinking the same
14 Jun 17:47 - Sam Roberts: Maybe that it forces people to wait for the good rate?
14 Jun 17:47 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: http://www.npr.org/sections/money/2014/07/11/330680385/episode-552-blockbusters-bombs-and-the-price-of-a-ticket
14 Jun 17:48 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: Not quite the same as your idea, but same principle
14 Jun 17:56 - Owen: I was thinking exactly the same thing mike. Including the "I can't remember any of the conclusions" bit.
14 Jun 17:57 - Owen: If I remember the show was more about why blockbusters don't cost more than indie films.
14 Jun 17:58 - Owen: And if I remember correctly it's because the studios don't let it happen.
14 Jun 18:20 - Bongo: Charging less for how long it's been out would be admitting that it's value deteriorates over time which is probably only true just after release but it would make it seem that way past the release
14 Jun 18:20 - Bongo: So they probably just want to market it as "all of our movies are timeless"
14 Jun 18:21 - Bongo: Also it might convince people who were already going to see it straight away that they should wait until it gets cheaper
14 Jun 18:23 - Alex Bunn: Btw my housemates say the new jurassic world film is cheesy awesomeness to the max
14 Jun 18:23 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: Yeah I wana see it
14 Jun 18:23 - Sam Roberts: Is it out? Thought it was next month?
14 Jun 18:24 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: Nah it's out
14 Jun 18:24 - Owen: I'm seeing it in IMAX next Saturday!!
14 Jun 18:25 - Dave: I'd be up for a mid week film if anyone else is
14 Jun 18:37 - Dave: <Media omitted>
14 Jun 18:40 - Tegan: well, there are a lot of barbers
14 Jun 18:40 - Tegan: I guess you have to differentiate yourself
14 Jun 18:43 - Lorna: The Jurassic park film is supposed to be basically an inferior copy of the first one.
14 Jun 18:44 - Bongo: That would still make it better than any of the sequels
14 Jun 18:44 - Dave: Beat me to it!
14 Jun 18:44 - Bongo: They're.. They're.. They're learning
14 Jun 18:44 - Angela: I went to see it today, it's extremely silly but quite enjoyable
14 Jun 18:45 - Tegan: had it got any real fictional science in it?
14 Jun 18:45 - Angela: Some mega cheesy scenes, yup some real fictional science, a wobbly DNA character
14 Jun 18:45 - Angela: Keeps
14 Jun 18:45 - Angela: Jeeps
14 Jun 18:46 - Angela: It has it all
14 Jun 18:46 - Tegan: You know, like when the sharks got smarter, or when the scientists discovered green?
14 Jun 18:46 - Tegan: awesome to the max
14 Jun 18:47 - Angela: Nobody gives a shit about archeologists any more though, that's old hat
14 Jun 18:47 - Angela: It's all about snazzy geneticists
14 Jun 18:47 - Bongo: Does it have a scene where they hack into the mainframe to save the day?
14 Jun 18:48 - Tegan: The dna mainframe...
14 Jun 18:48 - Bongo: By a girl who learnt how to hack from Microsoft excel 2000 training
14 Jun 18:48 - Tegan: yeah!
14 Jun 18:48 - Angela: I can't confirm or deny those rumours. It might spoil the incredible suspense and uncertainty about the outcome
14 Jun 18:49 - Lorna: Jurassic park trivia: when Dr Grant gets on the helicopter and has two female ends of his seatbelt, he ties them together. This is a metaphor for how NATURE FINDS A WAY
14 Jun 18:49 - Angela: mind. Blown.
14 Jun 18:49 - Shaggy: Actually the hacking scene is pretty much the only example that is feasible and uses real existing tools
14 Jun 18:50 - Tegan: and a potent reminder that you should never shake with a lizard
14 Jun 18:50 - Tegan: lest you change its sex
14 Jun 18:55 - Tegan: No niche mighty bosh radio fans in the house then
14 Jun 18:55 - Tegan: k
14 Jun 18:55 - Angela: There needs to be a tumbleweed emoji
14 Jun 19:14 - Bongo: Lol that's not nature finding a way, that's man making the most of a situation when he's inbetween two female parts
14 Jun 21:55 - Owen: http://imgur.com/Xsu770n
14 Jun 22:04 - Bongo: Amazing! I always like to think animals are way more intelligent than us and that they're just putting on a show for us every time we try to document them so see how far they get make us believe is silly things
14 Jun 22:04 - Bongo: So many typos, I give up
15 Jun 11:56 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: <Media omitted>
15 Jun 11:56 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: Last C town big meat ever!
15 Jun 11:56 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: Attendance mandatory
15 Jun 11:59 - Shaggy: Mega hype
15 Jun 11:59 - Alex Bunn: I'm no longer team stannis
15 Jun 12:00 - Alex Bunn: He can fucking freeze to death in the most anticlimactic last episode
15 Jun 12:00 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: #teamwhitewalkers
15 Jun 12:00 - Shaggy: Just cause you can't tan
15 Jun 12:02 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: I don't get why anyone was surprised about stannis
15 Jun 12:02 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: This is how he's acted the whole show
15 Jun 12:03 - Alex Bunn: But he did the speech
15 Jun 12:03 - Alex Bunn: About the princess
15 Jun 12:03 - Alex Bunn: With the awkward reluctant hug
15 Jun 12:03 - Sam Roberts: <Media omitted>
15 Jun 12:04 - Alex Bunn: Maybe they needed to play up his desperation a bit more rather than his fatherly qualities
15 Jun 12:04 - Alex Bunn: Good image sam!
15 Jun 12:13 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: Stannis shouldn't have shot his load on his brother, so to speak
15 Jun 12:14 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: Should have saved that shadow thing for the end boss, probly danaerys at this rate
15 Jun 12:24 - Alex Bunn: He just wanted to bang the red priestess
15 Jun 12:25 - Alex Bunn: Shadow baby assassin = fortunate result
15 Jun 12:26 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: Such a lad
15 Jun 13:33 - Tegan: totally unhyped to miss last big meat Monday :(
15 Jun 13:33 - Tegan: request minimal spoilers
15 Jun 13:37 - Sam Roberts: Oh nooooo! How come?
15 Jun 13:38 - Tegan: <Media omitted>
15 Jun 13:39 - Tegan: sunshine lacking
15 Jun 13:39 - Sam Roberts: That's not how I pictured Tring
15 Jun 13:40 - Tegan: Nah, Bletchley
15 Jun 13:40 - Tegan: Then sri lanka
15 Jun 13:41 - Sam Roberts: Hmm you might want to leave the horde for a couple of days
15 Jun 13:41 - Sam Roberts: I promise I won't spoiler, but drunk Sam promises nothing
15 Jun 13:43 - Joe Jarman: JOoooooohhhhhnnmm snnnOOoOOOh
15 Jun 13:44 - Joe Jarman: watch teegz downloooad it
15 Jun 14:08 - Owen: Is that a canal bridge over a river? How quaint!

15 Jun 14:39 - Tegan: Pretty quaint
15 Jun 14:39 - Tegan: Some sizeable bats flappin about
15 Jun 14:52 - Owen: Bats! Jewels!
15 Jun 19:26 - Dave: Can someone bring cooking oil
15 Jun 23:15 - Dave: Horde! No talking about GoT.
15 Jun 23:15 - Dave: Just saying now.
15 Jun 23:15 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: I called it.
15 Jun 23:15 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: Let it be known.
15 Jun 23:35 - Joe Jarman: You know nothing swarbrick Jones!!
15 Jun 23:36 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: <Media omitted>
16 Jun 04:01 - Tegan: nice :)
16 Jun 08:21 - Bongo: Not a huge fan of that last episode
16 Jun 08:21 - Bongo: Oh wait I'll shut up if people haven't seen it yet
16 Jun 08:25 - Owen: I can't believe that dynaruas shacked up with tommen!!!!
16 Jun 08:26 - Owen: It makes no sense. It sounds like I made it up!
16 Jun 08:26 - Bongo: All I'll say is, king Geoffrey coming back as a zombie was a bit of a shocker
16 Jun 08:34 - Alex Bunn: Joffrey*
16 Jun 08:36 - Bongo: No I mean the other king, king Geoffrey
16 Jun 08:37 - Bongo: <Media omitted>
16 Jun 08:38 - Bongo: When we found out one of the dragons was hitler my mind was blown
16 Jun 08:46 - Owen: Stanos was a ice giant all along.
16 Jun 08:47 - Owen: ANd JaN snooo was a figment or a pirate's imagination.
16 Jun 08:52 - Owen: But in all seriousness: heavy metal poisoning was a bit of a lame way to kill off all the main characters. Did the show get cancelled suddenly and the writers had to come up with something in the spur of the moment?
16 Jun 09:29 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: What's the next hype train then?
16 Jun 09:29 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: True detective? Rick and Morty?
16 Jun 09:30 - Lorna: True detective!

16 Jun 10:18 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: I dunno, bit apprehensive about true detective
16 Jun 10:19 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: Rick and Morty I am thoroughly psyched for
16 Jun 10:19 - Dave: Sames - but equally i trust them to do the right thing
16 Jun 21:59 - Dave: Sup c town. When y'all home?x

17 Jun 15:25 - Dave: Or inside...
17 Jun 15:33 - Owen: Get a dragon.
17 Jun 15:33 - Owen: They said no barbecues, not no dragons.
17 Jun 17:26 - Bongo: No there's an asterix at the bottom that says "strictly no dragons"
17 Jun 19:06 - Owen: Damn those bastards. I was totally going to bring my dragon that definitely exists
18 Jun 09:50 - Lora: Peeps. If you're around old st tonight, my company has a pop-up shop in the station for London tech week and I'm running a FREE HAPPY HOUR tonight 6-8p. Come by if you can! I said its free, didn't I? üçªüç∑üç∏üéâ

19/06/2015, 19:01 - Mike SJ: Balcony! Balcony!

20/06/2015, 10:54 - Bongo: Mike tried to fizz up sam's bottle by hitting it on the top, but just ended up smashing both bottles and cutting himself
20/06/2015, 10:58 - Owen: Standard mike behaviour.
20/06/2015, 10:59 - Lorna: That giant watch is the champion's belt!

08/07/2015, 19:15 - Henry Dranks: why? it's a fucking shit hole
08/07/2015, 19:15 - Bongo: I think it's like a historical landmark or something
08/07/2015, 19:15 - Henry Dranks: I have to go thru that place twice a day and its my most hated place in london

08/07/2015, 19:15 - Mike Joyce: He works in scoop and save
08/07/2015, 19:16 - Bongo: But I can understand people having irrational emotional feelings for it
08/07/2015, 19:17 - Shaggy: It's more the fact that people who live here are being squeezed out, into an even worse shithole somewhere else
08/07/2015, 19:18 - Mike SJ: In before: canning town

08/07/2015, 19:23 - Bongo: Also, he won't be able to fit past the shopping centre doors
08/07/2015, 19:25 - Dan Sluckin: I suppose he's also quite susceptible to siege weapons
08/07/2015, 19:25 - Mike Joyce: You have to be built like a brick shot house to mannage....then it defeats the point
08/07/2015, 19:25 - Mike Joyce: *shit

08/07/2015, 19:35 - Mike Joyce: *bricks
08/07/2015, 19:36 - Mike Joyce: That is good to know....next time I'm being mugged I will through that out there to confuse and distract....then I will run away

08/07/2015, 20:03 - Bongo: But you would have to land in the Thames every day
08/07/2015, 20:03 - Bongo: That shit is dirty
08/07/2015, 20:36 - Mike Joyce: One of the cleanest rivers in Europe! Apparently.....that's shut is just mud....tidal river innit
08/07/2015, 21:12 - Dave: Parachute into work
08/07/2015, 21:13 - Dave: Let the plane crash
08/07/2015, 21:14 - Mike Joyce: And send the plane pioletless carrering across London.....maybe 911 was just a comute
08/07/2015, 21:14 - Dave: An awesome commute

08/07/2015, 21:20 - Mike Joyce: This is the best thing since sliced train....go to bed in London...wake up in Scotland....then back again.....could wake up "fresh" for work
08/07/2015, 21:21 - Mike SJ: Sliced train lol
08/07/2015, 21:21 - Mike SJ: They're called cars Mike
08/07/2015, 21:27 - Mike Joyce: I prefer the term transportation slices
09/07/2015, 02:49 - Bongo: Guy verhofstadt is awesome
09/07/2015, 09:32 - Mike SJ: I just watched the video of him.  Great orator, felt a bit like it was grandstanding at this point though
09/07/2015, 09:33 - Mike SJ: It's like lecturing your teenage son on cleaning his room while he's standing in front of you on fire
09/07/2015, 10:08 - Alex Bunn: Whats he done?
09/07/2015, 10:08 - Alex Bunn: I can't imagine why any Belgians would be awesome üòâ
09/07/2015, 10:15 - Mike SJ: When Jean Claude Van Damme is your coolest export you know you're in trouble
09/07/2015, 10:25 - Owen: Umm... Beer...
09/07/2015, 10:27 - Mike SJ: Beer's not a person Owen
09/07/2015, 10:26 - Owen: You just said "coolest export"
09/07/2015, 10:27 - Owen: Also beer makes me a different person
09/07/2015, 10:27 - Mike SJ: Fine alumnus then
09/07/2015, 10:27 - Owen: So I count it as a person
09/07/2015, 10:45 - Bongo: Guy is a European politician who hates ukip, especially Nigel garage
09/07/2015, 10:45 - Bongo: *twatface
09/07/2015, 11:36 - Joe Jarman: Top budget yesterday
09/07/2015, 11:36 - Joe Jarman: Torytastic
09/07/2015, 11:49 - Bongo: I didn't see it, was it all "stop giving money to those who need it because all the rich people want 2 faberge eggs each"?
09/07/2015, 11:58 - Owen: There's an online calculator where you can put in what you earn and see how much you save.  I'm ¬£7 a month better off. This makes me so glad we have a bedroom tax. I mean that ¬£7 will buy me an extra beer and a half, that's totally worth thousands of poor people being kicked out of thier homes through no fault of their own. Gooooo budget!!!
09/07/2015, 12:03 - Joe Jarman: I don't know about the no fault thing...
09/07/2015, 12:05 - Mike SJ: Yeah why don't they just try not being poor for once?
09/07/2015, 12:05 - Joe Jarman: Think there are some great incentives
09/07/2015, 12:05 - Joe Jarman: And capping child benefits is excellent
09/07/2015, 12:05 - Joe Jarman: Moving towards a one child policy!!!
09/07/2015, 12:05 - Joe Jarman: Stop the poor breeding!
09/07/2015, 12:08 - Mike SJ: Not convinced capping benefits is going to do anything to birth rates
09/07/2015, 12:09 - Mike SJ: Maybe some people have kids for benefits, but I really don't think that's normal
09/07/2015, 12:09 - Mike SJ: It's just going to increase the number of kids in poverty
09/07/2015, 12:09 - Tegan: especially the ones already born
09/07/2015, 12:10 - Tegan: that bbc synopsis we read yesterday was very right leaning
09/07/2015, 12:10 - Tegan: it didn't really mention any of the major tax cuts to low  income families
09/07/2015, 12:11 - Tegan: luckily now I've read the independent so I've got my bias back on course

10/07/2015, 10:59 - Eliza: I have the table book from 7-10
10/07/2015, 11:01 - Tegan: Awesome :D
10/07/2015, 11:03 - Owen: How many spaces are there?
10/07/2015, 11:06 - Eliza: I booked for 8 - I think we have 7 people for sure and Cate, Sam and Krizia are maybes... I think it should be ok if we run over by a couple. If anyone else is planning on coming let me know though and I'll see if I can increase the table.
10/07/2015, 11:06 - Eliza: I don't think you *need* to be booked - but it would be nice if everyone had seats together...
10/07/2015, 11:20 - Bongo: Where is said lizard event?
10/07/2015, 11:20 - Bongo: What's it called?
10/07/2015, 11:22 - Owen: It's called an orgy with your lizard mother, bongo!
10/07/2015, 11:27 - Lorna: Was I on the yes list?
10/07/2015, 11:28 - Eliza: @bongo - it's at the last Tuesday society. Near London fields again. @lorna, I think so, yes.
10/07/2015, 11:29 - Lorna: Great, ta
10/07/2015, 11:34 - Owen: @bongo - a sensible answer. From Eliza.
10/07/2015, 11:40 - Bongo: @eliza was I on the list? If not can I gatecrash?
10/07/2015, 11:40 - Bongo: @owen, that name is a much better name for it, I think I'll just call it that from now on
10/07/2015, 11:42 - Owen: Yeah I know right. It's not even on a Tuesday, let alone last Tuesday.
10/07/2015, 11:50 - Eliza: Bongo you're on the list!
10/07/2015, 12:45 - Bongo: Yussss
10/07/2015, 12:45 - Bongo: What do you mean by booked a table as well, are we dining with the reptiles?
10/07/2015, 12:46 - Lorna: Or on the reptiles?
10/07/2015, 12:49 - Bongo: Sitting on the reptiles or eating them?
10/07/2015, 12:50 - Lorna: I guess it probably depends on the size reptile...
10/07/2015, 12:53 - Eliza: I think the plan is sit at a table, drink some drinks and have lizards presented for our amusement. I think they also serve food if you want any.
10/07/2015, 12:54 - Bongo: Cool, do we get to fight then Pokemon-style
10/07/2015, 12:55 - Eliza: Almost certainly. In fact I think it's encouraged.
10/07/2015, 12:55 - Bongo: Tarantula, I choose you! Then chuck it in Owen's face
10/07/2015, 12:56 - Bongo: Tarantula, use anti-socialist arguments
10/07/2015, 12:57 - Bongo: Anti-socialist arguments is super effective!

22/07/2015, 15:07 - Alex Bunn: Nah i'm not gonna listen to it cos too many ppl said it was good
22/07/2015, 15:08 - Angela: https://firstlook.org/theintercept/2014/12/29/exclusive-interview-jay-wilds-star-witness-adnan-syed-serial-case-pt-1/
22/07/2015, 20:00 - Vanessa: Shaggy I had the same feeling. I heard so much about it I didn't want to listen to it. It took me about six months before I decided to and really loved it
22/07/2015, 22:32 - Dave: http://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/jul/22/rain-is-sizzling-bacon-cars-lions-roaring-art-of-sound-in-movies
22/07/2015, 22:32 - Dave: I liked this - Henry and Mike i think you would too.
22/07/2015, 22:32 - Dave: Others may also read it

23/07/2015, 10:14 - Henry Dranks: randomly enough I met up with a sound designer mate the other day who was telling me about a job he had recording the sound of a grand piano dropping 50ft onto concrete
23/07/2015, 10:53 - Dave: Lol - was he bald and moustashiod
23/07/2015, 10:58 - Owen: I'm pretty sure he looked like a coyote
23/07/2015, 11:00 - Owen: <Media omitted>
23/07/2015, 11:31 - Martha: <Media omitted>
23/07/2015, 11:31 - Martha: My view from the Caledonian sleeper this morning (all the cool kids are doing it).
23/07/2015, 11:32 - Martha: About to cycle 170miles. Scary! Big love to you all
23/07/2015, 11:33 - Alex Bunn: Ah that looks awesome!
23/07/2015, 11:33 - Alex Bunn: I'm jealous!
23/07/2015, 11:46 - Tegan: have a wicked holiday marth :)
23/07/2015, 11:47 - Dave: Go marth!
23/07/2015, 13:00 - Shaggy: That's a whole marthathon
23/07/2015, 13:01 - Owen: That's 6.538 marathons!
23/07/2015, 17:18 - Joe Jarman: <Media omitted>
23/07/2015, 17:18 - Joe Jarman: Star wars secret cinema
23/07/2015, 17:18 - Joe Jarman: Definitely the best possible secret cinema
23/07/2015, 17:26 - Dave: Could be cool - won't be cheap (¬£70?)
23/07/2015, 17:26 - Joe Jarman: üòé
23/07/2015, 17:26 - Joe Jarman: üôà but pricey
23/07/2015, 17:27 - Dave: Exactly. Wise monkey
23/07/2015, 17:29 - Joe Jarman: Definitely once of a lifetime experience
24/07/2015, 12:25 - Mike SJ: Who's up for Inside Out next week?
24/07/2015, 12:28 - Dave: Yep
24/07/2015, 12:45 - Tegan: Second
24/07/2015, 12:47 - Hannah Murphy: Moi
24/07/2015, 13:55 - Shaggy: I didn't realise it's an animation, I'm in
24/07/2015, 14:05 - Owen: Are you sure shaggy, it's highly rated on rotten tomatoes
24/07/2015, 14:06 - Alex Bunn: Yeah loads of ppl like it
24/07/2015, 14:06 - Alex Bunn: You'll probably hate it
24/07/2015, 14:15 - Hannah Murphy: I've heard it's as good as serial
24/07/2015, 14:34 - Mike SJ: Lol
24/07/2015, 14:44 - Shaggy: Even rotten tomatoes is mistaken sometimes
24/07/2015, 14:48 - Owen: Do you mean even shaggy's rotten tomatoes inverse is mistaken sometimes?
24/07/2015, 14:51 - Shaggy: Same thing. There exists a limited set of films that both of us would enjoy. It's very small, so it's a rate occurrence
24/07/2015, 15:34 - Bongo: This dude working next to me keeps singing like a 4 year old every now and again
24/07/2015, 15:34 - Bongo: üò°
24/07/2015, 15:34 - Alex Bunn: Video pls
24/07/2015, 15:38 - Shaggy: Haha
24/07/2015, 15:39 - Shaggy: This dude next to me keep alternative between "fuck" and "yes". With a French accent. It's hilarious
24/07/2015, 16:29 - Bongo: Ffs he's the most distracting person
24/07/2015, 16:29 - Bongo: He's doing impressions of a geeky consultant
24/07/2015, 16:30 - Bongo: He's got his top button done up, glasses on and mumbling "this is consulting, this is consulting"
24/07/2015, 16:35 - Shaggy: Hahaha
24/07/2015, 16:41 - Owen: Bongo, have you moved from goldman sachs to whatever asylum was featured in one flew over the cuckoo's nest? Say hi to danny de vito for me.
24/07/2015, 16:49 - Bongo: I reckon so
24/07/2015, 16:50 - Bongo: It would be really creepy if I found out this is actually an insane asylum and I've checked myself in without realising it
24/07/2015, 16:52 - Shaggy: That would be crazy
24/07/2015, 16:54 - Owen: #shutterIsland
24/07/2015, 16:54 - Owen: #shockCorridor
24/07/2015, 16:55 - Owen: But seriously watch those two films, they are Aaaawwwsssooommmee.
24/07/2015, 17:35 - Shaggy: I loved shutter island. Haven't seen the other one
24/07/2015, 18:06 - Mike SJ: Shutter island was whack
24/07/2015, 18:07 - Mike SJ: I spent the entire movie trying to convince myself the twist wasn't going to be that obvious
24/07/2015, 18:07 - Owen: You're clearly an idiot.
24/07/2015, 18:07 - Owen: Because that film was amazing
24/07/2015, 18:08 - Owen: And yes I also saw the twist coming a mile off.
24/07/2015, 18:15 - Mike SJ: Nah sorry that film had a dumb plot, no subtlety, and had a really shit attitude to mental health
24/07/2015, 18:15 - Mike SJ: (sorry to pull that card, but it is true)
24/07/2015, 18:16 - Tegan: It was beautiful
24/07/2015, 18:24 - Mike SJ: Maybe in a zero-depth, Pamela Anderson sense
24/07/2015, 18:24 - Mike SJ: I don't know why that film annoys me so, but I really think Scorsese has pulled a fast one on all of you
24/07/2015, 19:32 - Alex Bunn: I didnt see the twist coming. But i also didnt see the 6th sense twist coming
24/07/2015, 19:32 - Alex Bunn: #sucker
24/07/2015, 19:37 - Shaggy: You and me both
24/07/2015, 19:37 - Shaggy: But then I also thought Star Trek sucked balls
24/07/2015, 19:37 - Shaggy: Mike is just wrong
24/07/2015, 19:47 - Mike SJ: Nah, couldn't be
24/07/2015, 19:48 - Mike SJ: It's a classic silly B movie, it's silly to treat it as more than that
24/07/2015, 19:49 - Mike SJ: I'm done.
24/07/2015, 20:03 - Owen: Why are you treating it as more than that then.
24/07/2015, 20:07 - Mike SJ: 'Amazing', 'beautiful'
24/07/2015, 20:17 - Alex Bunn: Wow i just got soaked
24/07/2015, 20:18 - Alex Bunn: Should ve stayed in the pub!
24/07/2015, 20:18 - Martha: <Media omitted>
24/07/2015, 20:18 - Martha: Rain? What rain?
24/07/2015, 20:26 - Shaggy: Bah-rain
24/07/2015, 20:27 - Shaggy: Oh wait that's Scotland
24/07/2015, 20:27 - Shaggy: Did you do it marth?
24/07/2015, 20:28 - Martha: 87 miles down - halfway. SOMANYHILLS
24/07/2015, 20:30 - Alex Bunn: Looks shit
24/07/2015, 20:30 - Alex Bunn: üí©
24/07/2015, 20:31 - Martha: Bust my back wheel up pretty bad nailing all the cattle grids too fast. Thankfully got it fixed up pretty this morning in the town I was passing, and am good to keep going.
24/07/2015, 20:32 - Alex Bunn: üôå praise Jesus
24/07/2015, 20:32 - Martha: Ta.
24/07/2015, 20:32 - Martha: I don't think that was his name though.
24/07/2015, 20:33 - Owen: Derrick
24/07/2015, 20:34 - Martha: The dude used to work in brick lane bikes in London when it first started up. Swapped it in for a place of his own and epic nature every day. Have to say I'm pretty tempted.
24/07/2015, 20:37 - Shaggy: Still steals every back wheel he can't find
24/07/2015, 20:42 - Martha: You can take the mechanic out of brick lane...
24/07/2015, 20:58 - Shaggy: Without paying any money...
25/07/2015, 10:42 - Mike SJ: <Media omitted>
25/07/2015, 10:46 - Alex Bunn: Lanaaa!
25/07/2015, 14:00 - Tegan: Go Marth!
25/07/2015, 17:26 - Martha: <Media omitted>
25/07/2015, 17:26 - Shaggy: Wow is that iphone headphones? Awesome
25/07/2015, 17:27 - Martha: Daily forecast from Scotland: still good. Can we do something like this together sometime soon? Love from Tarbert xx
25/07/2015, 17:27 - Shaggy: Would love to. Let's do Europe later in the year, Italy in october/November?
25/07/2015, 17:29 - Martha: Long as it's not too snowy. Italy sounds great, they've got the food, wine and landscape. That's a hat trick.
25/07/2015, 19:38 - Vanessa: I'll take the train and meet you at the destinations
25/07/2015, 19:38 - Bongo: Down for Europe
25/07/2015, 19:39 - Bongo: 40% off ba flights in Europe with my life assurance
25/07/2015, 19:39 - Mike SJ: Lol, take a taxi and taunt them
25/07/2015, 19:59 - Sam Roberts: Always fancied a cycle across Spain, Italy would be most boday as well!
25/07/2015, 20:00 - Sam Roberts: You done Marth? Epic ride!
25/07/2015, 20:00 - Sam Roberts: Man that really puts our Cambridge antics to shame üòâ
25/07/2015, 21:14 - Martha: Nah, final day tomorrow. 30miles left, couple of ferries, train to Glasgow and then night train home. Yay! Xx
25/07/2015, 22:08 - Sam Roberts: Heavy sleeper train after all that!
26/07/2015, 10:07 - Mike SJ: Sunday? More like Rainday amirite?
26/07/2015, 10:08 - Mike SJ: #selffive
26/07/2015, 10:10 - Alex Bunn: Get home ok?

26/07/2015, 10:39 - Mike SJ: Hahaha
26/07/2015, 10:39 - Mike SJ: In-jokes
26/07/2015, 10:41 - Hannah Murphy: For those of you who missed it, shaggy ranted persistently last night about how cashew nuts are like tiny penises
26/07/2015, 10:41 - Hannah Murphy: And I mean persistently
26/07/2015, 10:46 - Mike SJ: Yeah shaggy, you've ruined cashew nuts for me forever now
26/07/2015, 10:46 - Mike SJ: I'm never going to be able to take them seriously again
26/07/2015, 11:31 - Bongo: Was he still going on about that?
26/07/2015, 11:31 - Bongo: And yea cheers bunny, awesome times
26/07/2015, 11:40 - Alex Bunn: Everyone else will have to swing round next time!
26/07/2015, 14:35 - Dave: Whoop
27/07/2015, 13:14 - Mike SJ: <Media omitted>
27/07/2015, 14:05 - Shaggy: Haha
27/07/2015, 14:05 - Shaggy: Must be a pit ill
27/07/2015, 14:05 - Shaggy: Pitbull
27/07/2015, 14:06 - Shaggy: In the absence of pizza I think we should make wraps again, they were delicious last time. Assuming anyone is coming...
27/07/2015, 14:07 - Owen: Are you lot still watching poo detective?
27/07/2015, 14:33 - Alex Bunn: I think iv given up
27/07/2015, 14:34 - Owen: I'll come along for food and drinks but might nip off before shit cop.
27/07/2015, 14:37 - Mike SJ: In two weeks there'll be a Rick and Morty we haven't seen
27/07/2015, 14:38 - Mike SJ: That'll be the shot in the arm we need
27/07/2015, 14:40 - Owen: Yeah that'll be much better than crap pig.
27/07/2015, 14:44 - Lorna: So which night shall we watch inside out? Wednesday?
27/07/2015, 14:46 - Mike SJ: Yeah I think Weds is best for a few people
27/07/2015, 14:47 - Mike SJ: I'm not organising this one after the Mad Max fiasco
27/07/2015, 14:47 - Owen: Is that "few people" you mike?
27/07/2015, 14:47 - Mike SJ: Sam and Kriz as well
27/07/2015, 14:48 - Mike SJ: I can do tomo if its better
27/07/2015, 14:49 - Lorna: Weds also better for me
27/07/2015, 14:52 - Owen: I am home this week so would prefer the weekend, but it looks like that won't happen so don't mind about me.
27/07/2015, 14:54 - Lorna: Well, when we organise it for weds, and fail to all get to the same cinema they'll probably be a second attempt at the weekend
27/07/2015, 14:58 - Sam Roberts: So I guess we should book tickets this time
27/07/2015, 15:12 - Dave: Tuesday has cheap tickets in some cinemas. Can anyone only do wed?
27/07/2015, 16:18 - Lorna: Is unlikely I can do any day apart from weds. Also, if you buy insurance through comparethemarket.com you get 241 cinema tickets Tuesday and Wednesday. And one day of travel insurance in the UK is about ¬£2
27/07/2015, 16:18 - Lorna: Bit late for this week though
27/07/2015, 16:39 - Joe Jarman: I've got a code!
27/07/2015, 16:46 - Mike SJ: Lol, that's pretty random
27/07/2015, 16:49 - Joe Jarman: I've been banging on about it for months
27/07/2015, 16:49 - Joe Jarman: Haven't actually been  to the cinema yet
27/07/2015, 16:49 - Mike SJ: Good find Lorna
27/07/2015, 16:49 - Joe Jarman: ....
27/07/2015, 16:49 - Joe Jarman: .....
27/07/2015, 16:50 - Dave: Go lorna! üôè
27/07/2015, 16:50 - Joe Jarman: Wooooo lorna üòé
27/07/2015, 16:50 - Joe Jarman: üòî
27/07/2015, 17:16 - Lorna: Yay for me! üòÑ
27/07/2015, 17:30 - Dave: What's the plan for tonight?
27/07/2015, 17:44 - Lorna: Looks like there isn't one
27/07/2015, 17:47 - Lorna: Though we could go for food/drinks if people don't fancy true detective?
27/07/2015, 18:18 - Dave: Shabongo?
27/07/2015, 18:19 - Tegan: Mike, we have proms on Wednesday i think
27/07/2015, 18:20 - Tegan: RACHMANANOV!
27/07/2015, 18:20 - Dave: Oh yeah! we do
27/07/2015, 18:21 - Krizia: Why dont we do it maybe Thursday
27/07/2015, 18:21 - Krizia: Or next week?
27/07/2015, 18:22 - Sam Roberts: Could do a late one tomorrow, got the climbing first though
27/07/2015, 18:22 - Dave: Next week could make sense
27/07/2015, 18:23 - Sam Roberts: Good shout, seems like we've got about 50% anytime this week!
27/07/2015, 18:23 - Mike SJ: And we can all buy travel insurance
27/07/2015, 18:23 - Tegan: Evening plan?
27/07/2015, 18:24 - Tegan: I'm still up for true detective
27/07/2015, 18:24 - Tegan: I quite enjoyed last weeks
27/07/2015, 18:24 - Tegan: Now I'm over the fact that it'll never be as good as the original
27/07/2015, 18:24 - Shaggy: I made some pulled pork for the wraps
27/07/2015, 18:25 - Tegan: Any pulled parsnips?
27/07/2015, 18:25 - Dave: You can't pull a parsnip
27/07/2015, 18:25 - Dave: üò≥
27/07/2015, 18:25 - Shaggy: Alas
27/07/2015, 18:26 - Dave: We'll bring something veggie to wrap
27/07/2015, 18:26 - Dave: You got enough wraps?
27/07/2015, 18:26 - Sam Roberts: I trust Dave as a man who's tried
27/07/2015, 18:26 - Shaggy: I'm still at work, will buy some on the way home
27/07/2015, 18:27 - Tegan: Just kicked out of work by a 6.25 fire alarm, so happy to go shopping
27/07/2015, 18:58 - Vanessa: Omg Rachmaninov! So jealous.  I always forget about the proms until it's too late
27/07/2015, 18:58 - Dave: I'm sure there's still some tickets
27/07/2015, 19:00 - Vanessa: I'll have a look
27/07/2015, 19:02 - Dave: You can always prom it too
27/07/2015, 19:09 - Vanessa: What does that mean?
27/07/2015, 19:43 - Tegan: If you queue for a while before ('prom') you get ¬£5 standing tickets
27/07/2015, 19:48 - Vanessa: Oh I might be able to do that
27/07/2015, 20:54 - Tegan: http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/articles/3598F306c3KnN6t3x6ThKpN/what-is-promming
27/07/2015, 20:54 - Tegan: Does this mean you're home, v??
27/07/2015, 21:05 - Vanessa: Yes it deos
27/07/2015, 21:05 - Vanessa: Does
27/07/2015, 21:05 - Vanessa: I just saw Prokofiev tomorrow night
27/07/2015, 21:12 - Vinay: Oh for a sec I thought you were asking me
27/07/2015, 22:02 - Tegan: Heard you were in Cambridge, other V
27/07/2015, 22:02 - Tegan: How's it going?
28/07/2015, 08:50 - Sam Roberts: VV
28/07/2015, 08:50 - Sam Roberts: You guys should get together so we can call you W
28/07/2015, 08:51 - Sam Roberts: Anyone fancy a non-inside out film tomorrow?
28/07/2015, 08:53 - Sam Roberts: Minions or ant man could be fun
28/07/2015, 08:53 - Sam Roberts: What I really fancy is the new terminator and a bottle of rum though
28/07/2015, 09:23 - Tegan: Movie could be good - it's cineworld cheap night
28/07/2015, 09:24 - Tegan: How bad is the new terminator supposed to be?
28/07/2015, 09:59 - Mike SJ: Supposed to better than the last one
28/07/2015, 09:59 - Mike SJ: So not bad enough
28/07/2015, 10:12 - Joe Jarman: Haha
28/07/2015, 10:13 - Joe Jarman: Luana and I are going to see inside out in c wharf tonight
28/07/2015, 10:29 - Joe Jarman: We would come tomorrow but she has to work
28/07/2015, 11:03 - Sam Roberts: Think we've got a team outing next Wednesday dude
28/07/2015, 11:03 - Sam Roberts: Go samba dancing tonight
28/07/2015, 11:14 - Joe Jarman: Wednesday's are not good for luana
28/07/2015, 11:14 - Joe Jarman: That's beer day
28/07/2015, 11:15 - Joe Jarman: Cineworld man said you can use the ultimate pass with the meerkat thing
28/07/2015, 11:15 - Joe Jarman: I.e. 14.95/month for unlimited films for two people
28/07/2015, 11:15 - Joe Jarman: That's a deal
28/07/2015, 11:16 - Joe Jarman: You only need to see 1 film a month for that to make sense
28/07/2015, 11:20 - Mike SJ: Have you been to the cinema this year yet?
28/07/2015, 11:23 - Sam Roberts: I went to see Jurassic park the other day
28/07/2015, 11:23 - Sam Roberts: Which is awesome
28/07/2015, 11:24 - Sam Roberts: Really dumb in places, but all the introductions to the dinosaurs made me feel like a kid again

28/07/2015, 17:52 - Sam Roberts: <Media omitted>
28/07/2015, 18:20 - Alex Bunn: Lol
28/07/2015, 20:16 - Lora: Anyone seen or keen to see Amy Winehouse documentary this weekend?
28/07/2015, 21:09 - Owen: Anyone on here also on "climbing timing" does your wassap crash when you try and open it?
28/07/2015, 21:18 - Dave: Not for me
28/07/2015, 21:19 - Sam Roberts: I haven't lora, could be cool
28/07/2015, 21:19 - Sam Roberts: Think there's a bit going on as well though, Aussie's leaving partay?
28/07/2015, 21:24 - Lorna: I was thinking of seeing it tomorrow
28/07/2015, 22:05 - Tegan: I'd like to go, but can't make tomorrow
28/07/2015, 22:05 - Tegan: Or the weekend
28/07/2015, 22:23 - Lora: I was thinking tomorrow too lorna but may post pone to this weekend
29/07/2015, 09:00 - Owen: <Media omitted>
29/07/2015, 09:11 - Sam Roberts: d'awww
29/07/2015, 09:15 - Owen: *eats your cats food and makes them watch* ‚Äî oh my gdO CAN YOU DRAW GODZILLA MOMMA CARRYING... - http://lizardshuffle.tumblr.com/post/125284741454/oh-my-gdo-can-you-draw-godzilla-momma-carrying
29/07/2015, 09:15 - Owen: Full cartoon. Turns out I only saved one image of it.
30/07/2015, 16:22 - Mike SJ: Who do you reckon is the most famous Japanese person?
30/07/2015, 16:22 - Mike SJ: It seems really hard to think of them for some reason
30/07/2015, 16:23 - Mike SJ: Mr Miyagi?
30/07/2015, 16:23 - Shaggy: Suzuki? Mitsubishi?
30/07/2015, 16:24 - Mike SJ: I know nothing about either of those people
30/07/2015, 16:24 - Mike SJ: Except they started a car company
30/07/2015, 16:24 - Shaggy: Do you need to know about them? You said most famous
30/07/2015, 16:25 - Mike SJ: I think you should at least be able to pick them out of a line up
30/07/2015, 16:25 - Owen: Kurosawa
30/07/2015, 16:26 - Dan Sluckin: Godzilla?
30/07/2015, 16:26 - Mike SJ: The red power ranger
30/07/2015, 16:27 - Mike SJ: Shit, I think the real answer might be Yoko Ono
30/07/2015, 16:29 - Joe Jarman: Kesuke miyagi
30/07/2015, 16:32 - Dan Sluckin: Ken Watanabe
30/07/2015, 16:34 - Owen: It's obviously kurosawa
30/07/2015, 16:35 - Mike SJ: There is no way kurosawa is more well known than yoko ono
30/07/2015, 16:35 - Mike SJ: Much as I'd love prefer to be true
30/07/2015, 16:36 - Owen: Yoko oh no!!
30/07/2015, 16:40 - Tegan: I'd only know her as the one drinking out of a bowler hay
30/07/2015, 16:40 - Tegan: Hat
30/07/2015, 16:41 - Tegan: Would possibly fail buzzcocks line up
30/07/2015, 16:43 - Alex Bunn: Sad but possibly true
30/07/2015, 16:43 - Alex Bunn: Yuko wins
30/07/2015, 16:52 - Bongo: Surely the emperor
30/07/2015, 16:54 - Mike SJ: Takeshi?
30/07/2015, 16:56 - Alex Bunn: Lol no
30/07/2015, 16:56 - Joe Jarman: Hiromi tanaka
30/07/2015, 16:59 - Owen: The irony of you calling her yuko is palpable.
30/07/2015, 17:00 - Alex Bunn: Lol
30/07/2015, 17:00 - Alex Bunn: Ah well
30/07/2015, 17:00 - Alex Bunn: Hey are peeps aware that aussie Loz is leaving
30/07/2015, 17:00 - Alex Bunn: And tomorrow is a big party
30/07/2015, 17:04 - Vanessa: The writer Murakami
30/07/2015, 17:06 - Krizia: Noooo
30/07/2015, 17:06 - Krizia: mr miyaki
30/07/2015, 17:06 - Owen: ITT people who don't know how to spell Japanese names.
30/07/2015, 17:06 - Krizia: Jajajajjahahha
30/07/2015, 17:09 - Shaggy: Mr ghibli, whatever his name is
30/07/2015, 17:09 - Shaggy: Samurai champloo
30/07/2015, 17:11 - Krizia: Mr Wasabe
30/07/2015, 17:15 - Bongo: Jackie chan
30/07/2015, 17:15 - Shaggy: He's Chinese...
30/07/2015, 17:15 - Alex Bunn: Racist
30/07/2015, 17:16 - Shaggy: Surely racist is he who can't tell the difference
30/07/2015, 17:17 - Alex Bunn: It was directed at bong
30/07/2015, 17:21 - Shaggy: It's hard to tell who you're looking at in whatsapp
30/07/2015, 17:37 - Alex Bunn: You were just quicker!
30/07/2015, 17:41 - Sam Roberts: Star trek guy
30/07/2015, 17:41 - Sam Roberts: George takeshi
30/07/2015, 17:42 - Krizia: üë≤
30/07/2015, 17:42 - Krizia: This guy!
30/07/2015, 17:55 - Mike SJ: Ash Ketchum
30/07/2015, 22:41 - Dave: "Number 1 priority" - when you really need a wee
30/07/2015, 23:41 - Sam Roberts: No one talks about a number 2 priority
31/07/2015, 00:16 - Dan Sluckin: Go ahead
31/07/2015, 00:16 - Owen: Dan, what's your favourite food?
31/07/2015, 00:17 - Dan Sluckin: Sutton Spaghetti Bolognese
31/07/2015, 00:17 - Owen: Dan I have another question.
31/07/2015, 00:17 - Owen: But will ask it in Owen and Dan horde
31/07/2015, 01:49 - Mike SJ: Blasphemy!
31/07/2015, 01:50 - Mike SJ: For it is written : 'I am the horde thy God. Thou shalt have no other hordes before me'
31/07/2015, 01:51 - Mike SJ: Shaggy ban them
31/07/2015, 08:44 - Sam Roberts: <Media omitted>
31/07/2015, 08:45 - Bongo: Why can't they just wire the amount they miss sold to our accounts?
31/07/2015, 08:45 - Bongo: Why bother calling?
31/07/2015, 08:47 - Sam Roberts: Good question
31/07/2015, 08:47 - Sam Roberts: I'd guess bad record keeping
31/07/2015, 08:54 - Dave: I think they need to establish that it was missold in each case. My dad got asked lots of questions when he applied.
31/07/2015, 09:15 - Sam Roberts: Did he win?
31/07/2015, 09:15 - Shaggy: Question is why they call non lloyds customers
31/07/2015, 09:16 - Dave: He did - tbh i don't think it's that hard!
31/07/2015, 09:17 - Sam Roberts: I'd go for it if I'd ever had credit
31/07/2015, 09:18 - Sam Roberts: It's all banks shag, think hsbc had a similar provision recently
31/07/2015, 09:20 - Dave: Our economic department are always keen to point out that PPI compensation has been so large (~¬£20bn) that it has probably had a macroeconomic effect on the UK economy.
31/07/2015, 09:37 - Bongo: Wow
31/07/2015, 09:37 - Bongo: More like "definitely"
31/07/2015, 09:38 - Bongo: 20 billion coming out of pockets of people who were borrowing money
31/07/2015, 09:38 - Bongo: During a recession
31/07/2015, 10:14 - Dave: Well, a lot of the money was taken from the borrowers pre-recession and the returned as a lump sum post recession. In that sense it was a significant fiscal stimulus (although it is true that there was also a drain from the economy to 'fund' it, but over a longer time)
31/07/2015, 10:48 - Bongo: Was it paid back with interest? You can't say taking ¬£100 and giving it back a few years later is a fiscal stimulus, that's preventing any potential investment
31/07/2015, 10:49 - Owen: Well a bank did have it. And theoretically they should be more efficient investors than your average joe.
31/07/2015, 10:57 - Dave: Injecting 20bn into the economy is surely a stimulus. Although you could say it's like giving someone a long relaxing massage then injecting them with adrenaline.
31/07/2015, 11:00 - Shaggy: Yawn. Make a finance group
31/07/2015, 11:00 - Tegan: Woah there Shaggy
31/07/2015, 11:01 - Tegan: Then where will i get my opinions on finance from?
31/07/2015, 11:01 - Mike SJ: The finance group
31/07/2015, 11:01 - Shaggy: Finance group
31/07/2015, 11:01 - Mike SJ: lol
31/07/2015, 11:01 - Dave: üçç
31/07/2015, 11:02 - Tegan: I'm not going to join the finance group
31/07/2015, 11:02 - Tegan: Yawn
31/07/2015, 11:03 - Shaggy: Lol
31/07/2015, 11:03 - Dave: This is nerdgasm fare i think
31/07/2015, 11:04 - Shaggy: It's not nerdy, it's boring
31/07/2015, 11:05 - Mike SJ: Boregasm
31/07/2015, 11:05 - Shaggy: Nailed it
31/07/2015, 11:10 - Dave: What's boring about major redress schemes being viewed as fiscal stimuli?
31/07/2015, 11:10 - Dave: Oh god...
31/07/2015, 11:10 - Dave: üòî
31/07/2015, 11:20 - Mike SJ: Man I always forget that there's like  30 people on this group
31/07/2015, 11:20 - Mike SJ: I wonder how many of them actually read every comment?
31/07/2015, 11:26 - Owen: Just you
31/07/2015, 11:28 - Mike SJ: I think I've read a good 95%
31/07/2015, 11:30 - Mike SJ: Sometimes it's says 153 new messages and I'm like 'how about no'
31/07/2015, 11:30 - Mike SJ: True story
31/07/2015, 11:39 - Owen: Riveting; and you had the nerve to call economics boring.
31/07/2015, 11:55 - Mike SJ: I have a story : last night I went on a date, and half way through she said she didn't like white people
31/07/2015, 11:58 - Dave: Wow - and you stayed for the second half?
31/07/2015, 11:58 - Mike SJ: Second half of the first pint yeah lol
31/07/2015, 11:58 - Owen: Why was she on a date with a white person then!!
31/07/2015, 11:59 - Owen: What race was she?
31/07/2015, 11:59 - Mike SJ: Definitely at least half white
31/07/2015, 11:59 - Mike SJ: I didn't say it made sense
31/07/2015, 11:59 - Owen: To be fair I don't like the majority of white people
31/07/2015, 11:59 - Dave: Lol
31/07/2015, 11:59 - Owen: I don't like the majority of people though
31/07/2015, 11:59 - Krizia: Hahahhahahha
31/07/2015, 12:01 - Mike SJ: Nice to have a low bar though
31/07/2015, 12:01 - Mike SJ: Only uphill from here
31/07/2015, 12:02 - Owen: Did she clarify at all?
31/07/2015, 12:07 - Mike SJ: Nah I wish I'd asked
31/07/2015, 12:07 - Owen: Because I don't like a black person - Bill Cosby
31/07/2015, 12:08 - Mike SJ: Instead of doing what I actually did which was stare blankly in silence for about 15 seconds and then change the subject
31/07/2015, 12:08 - Owen: Maybe she just doesn't like Taylor Swift's music and it came out wrong.
31/07/2015, 12:08 - Mike SJ: lol
31/07/2015, 12:13 - Tegan: Did she seem at all phased by this turn off events?
31/07/2015, 12:13 - Tegan: Does your profile have a picture? Or do you claim to be black?
31/07/2015, 12:16 - Mike SJ: Nah, I and everyone else in all my profile pictures are pretty clearly white
31/07/2015, 12:16 - Mike SJ: Women just can't resist I guess
31/07/2015, 12:16 - Owen: Woman*
31/07/2015, 12:17 - Dave: Ha
31/07/2015, 12:17 - Dave: üê£
31/07/2015, 13:20 - Owen: <Media omitted>
31/07/2015, 13:22 - Bongo: I don't get it
31/07/2015, 13:22 - Bongo: Here you can keep it?
31/07/2015, 13:36 - Owen: Herefordshire, you can keep it
31/07/2015, 13:41 - Owen: Is Loz party tonight or tomorrow?
31/07/2015, 13:48 - Bongo: Tonight
31/07/2015, 14:28 - Owen: Where is it.
31/07/2015, 14:28 - Owen: I get back to London about 10
31/07/2015, 14:32 - Mike SJ: Dunno where we'll be by then
31/07/2015, 14:32 - Mike SJ: Give someone a ring
31/07/2015, 14:32 - Mike SJ: But East London most likely
31/07/2015, 14:32 - Owen: Is it not at her house?
31/07/2015, 14:40 - Alex Bunn: Nah shoreditch most likely
31/07/2015, 14:40 - Alex Bunn: Think she's already moved out
31/07/2015, 14:41 - Owen: What's the plan for the evening.
31/07/2015, 14:41 - Owen: I'm getting into Euston at about 10 it would be nice to pop over for one on my way home.
31/07/2015, 15:09 - Bongo: <Media omitted>
31/07/2015, 15:21 - Alex Bunn: Not sure there is a plan O
31/07/2015, 15:21 - Alex Bunn: Usual mess of affairs
31/07/2015, 15:40 - Owen: I guess I'll just ask at 9:30
31/07/2015, 15:40 - Owen: If you are near Euston I'll come a knocking. If not I'll have been on a train for three house and will just head home.
31/07/2015, 17:38 - Bongo: And the award for laziest employee goes to.. The crazy guy who was sitting next to me last week who's now just constantly on reddit
31/07/2015, 17:56 - Owen: That's what happens when a company doesn't arbitrarily fire 5% of it's employees each year.
31/07/2015, 17:58 - Bongo: 20%
31/07/2015, 17:58 - Bongo: And I suppose
31/07/2015, 17:59 - Bongo: He would definitely be a likely candidate
31/07/2015, 18:02 - Owen: I thought it was 5, 20 wtf!
31/07/2015, 18:03 - Bongo: It's up to 20%, it's usually one or two from each team, usually contractors
31/07/2015, 18:09 - Shaggy: If it arbitrary it wouldn't help
31/07/2015, 18:09 - Shaggy: He could be hella lucky
31/07/2015, 21:02 - Sam Roberts: <Media omitted>
31/07/2015, 21:50 - Owen: Where abouts are people?
31/07/2015, 21:57 - Sam Roberts: Lisa's place
31/07/2015, 21:57 - Sam Roberts: E46ng
31/07/2015, 21:57 - Sam Roberts: E26ng
31/07/2015, 22:00 - Owen: Perhaps.
31/07/2015, 22:25 - Owen: Is that where everyone will be for the next hour?
01/08/2015, 13:02 - Owen: Hey horde. Is there anyone on here that doesn't know programming, or only knows a few things that would like to learn more?
01/08/2015, 13:23 - Sam Roberts: ‚úã
01/08/2015, 13:24 - Sam Roberts: In particular setting up heroku databases and apis
01/08/2015, 13:24 - Owen: You might already know a bit much Sam.
01/08/2015, 13:26 - Sam Roberts: Aww
01/08/2015, 13:26 - Owen: I'm looking for noobs to test this new work book that I will be teaching to year 8 next year. Just to iron out kinks and things that I haven't explained as well as I think I have.
01/08/2015, 13:26 - Sam Roberts: Oh yeah, I'm working at about a year 10 level
01/08/2015, 13:26 - Owen: You can give it a go though. But it is very much a beginner course
01/08/2015, 13:27 - Sam Roberts: Be happy to test run it anyway if you want though
01/08/2015, 13:27 - Sam Roberts: Hehe win
01/08/2015, 13:27 - Sam Roberts: Does it have any pi exercises in?
01/08/2015, 13:27 - Owen: Nah, it's all arduino
01/08/2015, 13:28 - Sam Roberts: Also cool
01/08/2015, 13:28 - Sam Roberts: Gimme a copy tomorrow
01/08/2015, 13:30 - Owen: I can't
01/08/2015, 13:31 - Owen: School is closed on the weekend so I can't pick up arduinos
01/08/2015, 13:32 - Sam Roberts: Ah I see, thought you meant all book work
01/08/2015, 13:33 - Sam Roberts: Well yeah, wing one my way sometime then
01/08/2015, 13:36 - Owen: Cool.

01/08/2015, 13:46 - Vanessa: Me me me
01/08/2015, 13:47 - Alex Bunn: I can give it a shot too
01/08/2015, 13:47 - Sam Roberts: <Media omitted>
01/08/2015, 13:47 - Owen: Nothing is perfect Hannah!
01/08/2015, 13:48 - Owen: The kids know nothing to so it's aimed at that.
01/08/2015, 13:55 - Hannah Murphy: Great! I'll try
01/08/2015, 14:00 - Owen: So I'll bring a copy and an arduino for the following people: Sam, Hannah, V and Bunn.
01/08/2015, 14:00 - Vanessa: Yay!
01/08/2015, 14:03 - Hannah Murphy: As long as I can outcode shaggy by the end of it
01/08/2015, 14:04 - Sam Roberts: üò≥üòÉ
01/08/2015, 14:04 - Owen: I guarantee it...
01/08/2015, 14:04 - Owen: For very specific examples
01/08/2015, 14:04 - Sam Roberts: Do I need a soldering iron ir anything?

03/08/2015, 15:25 - Bongo: TD last week was awesome
03/08/2015, 15:25 - Bongo: It's getting more and more hardcore

04/08/2015, 14:28 - Mike SJ: Tube strike might be a problem...
04/08/2015, 14:29 - Lorna: Yeah I do. How's Stratford for people? The overground and DLR are working
04/08/2015, 14:34 - Krizia: I dont mind the tube strike if we have overground/any form of transport.... Good excuse to wfh thursday!!! ‚ò∫
04/08/2015, 14:58 - Sam Roberts: Haha I might hit a 4 day wfh week!

04/08/2015, 16:26 - Mike SJ: Ta
04/08/2015, 19:01 - Tegan: Has anyone had a plaintive plea for sanctuary from Dave?
04/08/2015, 19:02 - Tegan: We were due down to Oliza's, but grim happenings at LB have stopped all the trains
04/08/2015, 19:02 - Tegan: I think his phone is dead now
04/08/2015, 19:03 - Vanessa: What's happening at LB?
04/08/2015, 19:03 - Tegan: Person under train I think :(
04/08/2015, 19:03 - Bongo: How inconsiderate
04/08/2015, 19:05 - Vanessa: Oh dear
04/08/2015, 19:05 - Mike SJ: I'll be home if you need a place
04/08/2015, 19:05 - Tegan: Oh dear is right - they should have a code for it
04/08/2015, 19:06 - Tegan: I can only think of really tasteless ideas...
04/08/2015, 19:06 - Tegan: That might be very awesome - Dave didn't message you did he?
04/08/2015, 19:07 - Mike SJ: Nah Sam I think
04/08/2015, 19:08 - Tegan: Same area code :)
04/08/2015, 19:08 - Tegan: Will I bring beer? Or gin?
04/08/2015, 19:09 - Mike SJ: Either/or :)
04/08/2015, 19:12 - Lorna: I like to know why my train is delayed, even if it is for morbid reasons. A 'customer incident' is too ambiguous. It unnerves me when they say that.
04/08/2015, 19:13 - Tegan: Sounds knife-wavy
04/08/2015, 21:06 - Lorna: Inside out people: it's showing at Stratford Westfield at 18:50 and 19:40. Either works for me. I vote we book. Any preference? Or different cinema?
04/08/2015, 21:25 - Shaggy: You know where we live, tegs ;)

05/08/2015, 08:15 - Shaggy: He'll be blue if he doesn't win

05/08/2015, 12:56 - Krizia: ‚ò∫‚ò∫üò≥

05/08/2015, 13:00 - Sam Roberts: But it's a paradise on earth
05/08/2015, 13:00 - Sam Roberts: We have a newly spare room... Anyone looking for a place to live?
05/08/2015, 13:01 - Owen: Who moved out?
05/08/2015, 13:01 - Sam Roberts: Andre the grumpy Portuguese
05/08/2015, 13:03 - Owen: Haha
05/08/2015, 13:04 - Owen: Replace him with a grumpy reclusive gamblaholic

05/08/2015, 14:40 - Mike SJ: The London Olympics were so good, why even bother? They should just rename it as the London Olympics from now on.
05/08/2015, 14:41 - Mike SJ: Next year, the London Olympics in Rio
05/08/2015, 16:42 - Alex Bunn: Feels like they're coming around so quickly!
05/08/2015, 16:44 - Mike SJ: <Media omitted>

05/08/2015, 16:55 - Sam Roberts: Weekend?
05/08/2015, 16:59 - Lorna: Yeah OK. Though I've been conditioned into thinking that films occur only on Tuesdays and Wednesdays, and on some sort of offer
05/08/2015, 17:09 - Tegan: Are people coming down to E&C way for Adele's leaving do on Saturday?
05/08/2015, 17:13 - Alex Bunn: Yah ‚úã

05/08/2015, 21:56 - Dan Sluckin: That's brilliant.
06/08/2015, 10:40 - Alex Bunn: Hands up if you're NOT working from home today
06/08/2015, 10:40 - Alex Bunn: ‚úãüò≠

06/08/2015, 10:50 - Mike SJ: Thug life
06/08/2015, 10:50 - Krizia: It builds pressure points were you actually need to work and were you can just chill!
06/08/2015, 10:51 - Lorna: And George Osbourne owes me, that's my theory
06/08/2015, 10:51 - Krizia: Is nice is like a real version of how work should be! Some good days some days of nothing less pretending.... I just miss the office gossip

07/08/2015, 16:10 - Tanya: Yes. That's a good plan. Just need to stay a float in the THAMES (yes..crazy!)...try not to get feet caught in any tesco trolleys or in any other mysteries of the Thames :)
07/08/2015, 16:14 - Mike Joyce: If it looks like poo and smells like poo then there is no mystery there. Yes come on down and support me in my giving of support!!

10/08/2015, 20:34 - Mike SJ: Lol
11/08/2015, 11:20 - Bongo: Kritz you know a lot about marketing, why do companies have slogans/mottos? I'm trying to discuss whether our consultancy should have one or not
11/08/2015, 11:20 - Bongo: Do Americans love company slogans? It feels like they do
11/08/2015, 11:22 - Shaggy: Just do it
11/08/2015, 11:23 - Mal: It's just for brand awareness and shit
11/08/2015, 11:23 - Mal: Something to focus campaigns around
11/08/2015, 11:25 - Mike SJ: We have an office in New York
11/08/2015, 11:25 - Mike SJ: They fucking love slogans
11/08/2015, 11:27 - Owen: Slogan is like naming your company twice, it's silly.
11/08/2015, 11:28 - Owen: Maybe its for when your company name doesn't make a good jingle
11/08/2015, 11:34 - Mike SJ: It's really easy to change your slogan though
11/08/2015, 11:34 - Mike SJ: Like coke and pepsi change slogans every year pretty much
11/08/2015, 11:34 - Krizia: Hey, yes is all about brand awareness and image around the company! I guess american companies do love them but its kind of old ....
11/08/2015, 11:35 - Krizia: Very 90s when big brands were building "families" as consumers
11/08/2015, 11:39 - Krizia: I guess you can have one now but is not as important as in the 90s when companies build companies reputation themselves. I guess thats why you can change the slogan as many times as needed
11/08/2015, 11:41 - Dave: Hey bongo - how about 'Blah Consultancy - we're sick at what you're shit at'
11/08/2015, 11:42 - Owen: I have a good one - 'Blah Consultancy - we won't give your children AIDs'
11/08/2015, 11:43 - Owen: That was your customers will think that all the other consultancy firms will.
11/08/2015, 11:43 - Owen: But you haven't explicitly said they will so you can't be sued for libel
11/08/2015, 12:04 - Dave: You'd be sued wheb you, inevitably, did give their children AIDS though

27/08/2015, 08:18 - Sam Roberts: Got a 2 man hurricane tent, no standing
27/08/2015, 08:19 - Sam Roberts: Or a ten man monster. Awesome and easy to put up, pain in the balls to get anywhere though

27/08/2015, 08:28 - Angela: I have no idea how big that is! But it looks like it would fit in a car
27/08/2015, 08:29 - Angela: Is it a one with sleeping pods or one big room?
27/08/2015, 08:31 - Mike SJ: One big one
27/08/2015, 08:31 - Angela: Haha
27/08/2015, 08:32 - Angela: Do you have a pic of it when it's up? Would it be massively antisocial on a small campsite?
27/08/2015, 08:33 - Angela: Maybe it would be awesome and everyone would be jealous of me
27/08/2015, 08:53 - Mal: Ah, a correct use of antisocial

28/08/2015, 08:16 - Sam Roberts: She never lasted too long on the horde... Can't hurt to try again though
28/08/2015, 09:00 - Mal: Is it because of the unreasonable amounts of messages do you think?
28/08/2015, 09:01 - Mike SJ: Pfft, you haven't seen anything Mal

28/08/2015, 09:18 - Lorna: Having to read 200 messaged to find out which pub people are at is a true test of loyalty to the horde

28/08/2015, 09:39 - Mike Joyce: What about a cerial cocktail obtained by mixing multiple cerials together to become something greater then the sum of its parts?
28/08/2015, 09:40 - Mike Joyce: Or perhaps through in some bbqed meats and maple syrup for the true breakfast experience
28/08/2015, 09:41 - Mike Joyce: Instead of milk use butter
28/08/2015, 09:41 - Mike Joyce: And sprinkle cocaine on the top and douse in whiskey. Truely the breakfast of champions?

28/08/2015, 10:35 - Sam Roberts: Oh! Bbq in c town Sunday
28/08/2015, 10:36 - Sam Roberts: Browen, I was thinking some garden games around midday for board game club, then big meat in the evening?
28/08/2015, 10:43 - Owen: Board game club is the weekend after. But I don't see why we couldn't play a cheeky coup.
28/08/2015, 10:46 - Bongo: Coups are always cheeky, there's no need to explicitly say it
28/08/2015, 10:49 - Mal: BBQ in c town?
28/08/2015, 10:49 - Mal: No can do
28/08/2015, 10:49 - Mal: Monday, surely
28/08/2015, 10:50 - Tegan: Monday is carnival day
28/08/2015, 10:50 - Mike SJ: My brother is down, he's basically a bbq god
28/08/2015, 10:50 - Mike SJ: Not sure he can do Monday
28/08/2015, 10:50 - Tegan: What isn't Niall a god of, though?
28/08/2015, 10:55 - Mal: Both days are carnival days
28/08/2015, 10:56 - Tegan: Obvs. Going on Monday though.
28/08/2015, 10:56 - Mal: Nah too risky
28/08/2015, 10:56 - Mal: I'm going to be mangled
28/08/2015, 10:57 - Mal: Tuesday is a work day
28/08/2015, 10:57 - Tegan: Fair enough
28/08/2015, 10:57 - Mal: Last year I couldn't have worked on Monday!
28/08/2015, 10:59 - Mal: Basically because carnival was followed by squat parties then a rave in the woods
28/08/2015, 10:59 - Mal: On the Sunday
28/08/2015, 11:00 - Tegan: To be fair, it sounds like you're planning to have a much cooler time than me
28/08/2015, 11:01 - Mal: Well the coolness was basically due to the unexpected spontaneity
28/08/2015, 11:01 - Mal: I was going home until this guy said to come into our party!
28/08/2015, 11:02 - Tegan: Your expectations are totally raised now, though
28/08/2015, 11:02 - Tegan: Sunday can only disappoint
28/08/2015, 11:02 - Tegan: Making Monday the only viable option
28/08/2015, 11:07 - Mal: It was all about being on the edge though
28/08/2015, 11:09 - Mal: To e hones today and tomorrow have session written all over them so Sunday may well be needed to wind down haha
28/08/2015, 11:09 - Mal: Keeping it organic
28/08/2015, 11:14 - Tegan: I'm not street enough to continue this conversation
28/08/2015, 11:14 - Tegan: Out :)
28/08/2015, 11:14 - Mike SJ: 2street4me
28/08/2015, 11:15 - Alex Bunn: Doing well to clock up the message spam today
28/08/2015, 11:15 - Shaggy: So what pub?
28/08/2015, 11:16 - Mal: I got "organic" from Archer, the edge was literal as in "the edge of the area on whih carnival is being staged". And the rest are typos.
28/08/2015, 11:16 - Tegan: :)
28/08/2015, 11:17 - Mal: <Media omitted>

28/08/2015, 11:20 - Shaggy: Ooo love that place
28/08/2015, 11:21 - Mal: IF the outdoor bit is essential, why pay ¬£5 for pints when you can go to, say, primrose hill, London fields etc, an drink for 1/5 of the price?
28/08/2015, 11:22 - Shaggy: Grass is wet
28/08/2015, 11:22 - Mal: I doubt that
28/08/2015, 11:22 - Shaggy: 100%
28/08/2015, 11:22 - Shaggy: Concrete isn't dry yet from all the rain
28/08/2015, 11:22 - Alex Bunn: Lol you are funny shags
28/08/2015, 11:23 - Alex Bunn: It'll be dry by lunch
28/08/2015, 11:23 - Mal: It won't be by 6. And the concrete here is well dry
28/08/2015, 11:23 - Mal: I've never seen such dry concrete
28/08/2015, 11:24 - Shaggy: You ain't seen nothin'
28/08/2015, 11:24 - Mal: And I've been to Vegas, Rajasthan and Kuwait
28/08/2015, 11:24 - Mal: This concrete is dryer than. All
28/08/2015, 11:24 - Shaggy: They can't afford rain in those countries
28/08/2015, 11:24 - Shaggy: So no way
28/08/2015, 11:25 - Mal: Kuwait is basically made of money
28/08/2015, 11:26 - Mal: The minimum withdrawal Fromm a cashpoint was equivelan to ¬£40!!
28/08/2015, 11:28 - Mal: To be fair I have a work shindig so it is no skin off my nose, I just can't bear to see people waste money
28/08/2015, 11:34 - Alex Bunn: I think the friday evening pub experience is necessary tonight
28/08/2015, 11:49 - Sam Roberts: I'm in for real beer and seats
28/08/2015, 11:49 - Sam Roberts: Parks are more a midday session to my mind
28/08/2015, 11:50 - Mal: You have 8-10 cold, wet months for real beer and seats
28/08/2015, 11:50 - Sam Roberts: For frolicking and frisbee
28/08/2015, 11:50 - Sam Roberts: Can't wait

28/08/2015, 11:52 - Mal: Like saying carling and kronenbourg are the same
28/08/2015, 11:52 - Sam Roberts: Cheap beer, soft padding and the only atmosphere is the one you bring with you
28/08/2015, 11:52 - Mal: Yeah basically the world needs more cheap chain pubs haha
28/08/2015, 11:52 - Mal: If independent pubs won't be cheap, fuck off and be replaced by a leviathan of commerce like JD
28/08/2015, 11:55 - Sam Roberts: Roebuck then?
28/08/2015, 11:55 - Shaggy: Carling and kronenbourg have 1% objective difference, tyskie and zywiec do not

28/08/2015, 12:04 - Shaggy: You can try, but I'll know straight away it's diluted
28/08/2015, 12:06 - Mal: Haha I wouldn't do it. Years ago when I worked at lords, home of rich cunts and money, we were actually told to incorporate that shit into the pre pours
28/08/2015, 12:06 - Mal: Must be illegal
28/08/2015, 12:14 - Shaggy: Woah amazing

16/09/2015, 13:09 - Alan: Phenoxymethylpenicillin
16/09/2015, 13:10 - Mal: Yeah that's fine then
16/09/2015, 13:10 - Mal: Penicillin based shiznit
16/09/2015, 13:11 - Alan: So its ok to mix alcohol and penicillin?
16/09/2015, 13:13 - Mal: Yeah
16/09/2015, 13:13 - Mal: I mean it's not good for you but none of the side effects are exacerbated
16/09/2015, 13:14 - Mal: Basically it won't have a negative effect on your body
16/09/2015, 13:15 - Mal: But  if you get mangled ire will clearly effect the effectiveness of it
16/09/2015, 13:15 - Mal: Of the penicillin
16/09/2015, 13:15 - Mal: But in terms of damaging you or your body, all is well
16/09/2015, 13:20 - Mal: Do you could easily have like 5 points for examine
16/09/2015, 13:20 - Mal: Example
16/09/2015, 13:21 - Alan: Perfect
16/09/2015, 13:21 - Alan: Thats enough for me to be fun on saturday then
16/09/2015, 13:22 - Alan: Thanks dr mal!
16/09/2015, 13:22 - Mal: No problem haha

16/09/2015, 20:26 - Angela: Maybe they'll have eggs and I can celebrate remotely
16/09/2015, 20:26 - Tegan: Everyone be making plans on my birthday! Not coooo!
16/09/2015, 20:26 - Tegan: No, I forgive you

But we should go to this regardless as it looks awesome (apart from being in clapha. hopefully they find a new location)
16/09/2015, 21:09 - Hannah Murphy: And keep Friday 13th (so lucky) nov free for my joining of the 27 club
16/09/2015, 21:31 - Hannah Murphy: If anyone hears of something fun to do that night, let me know! Xx
16/09/2015, 22:03 - Dave: I hear your birthday is going on that night so we could go to that
16/09/2015, 22:11 - Alan: Birthday is on the 8th. So would prefer the 6th if something better comes up...
16/09/2015, 22:12 - Alan: But regardless, this looks like a fun night
16/09/2015, 22:17 - Mal: Jargons birthday is shortly after as all

17/09/2015, 08:19 - Tegan: Whoop!
17/09/2015, 08:20 - Tegan: How do we celebrate?
17/09/2015, 08:20 - Mal: Austrian stuff
17/09/2015, 08:20 - Mal: Like barbies and shrimps
17/09/2015, 08:21 - Dave: Lol
17/09/2015, 08:22 - Dave: Welcome back Phil
17/09/2015, 08:29 - Bongo: "Hundreds injured as mass bundle erupts in Canning Town to celebrate return of Austrian"
17/09/2015, 08:36 - Tegan: Dudes, sorry to spam you - promise this is a one off - my little brother's friend is going to be deported on Monday. If you have 2 mins could you put your digital John Hancock on this petition? https://www.change.org/p/rt-hon-theresa-may-mp-keep-muhammad-safe?recruiter=225881541&utm_source=share_petition&utm_medium=facebook&utm_campaign=autopublish&utm_term=mob-md-share_petition-no_msg
17/09/2015, 08:37 - Tegan: They're only after another 100 odd signatures, which is so very doable
17/09/2015, 08:41 - Owen: What reason do they give for detaining him?
17/09/2015, 08:44 - Tegan: His asylum had been denied.  More here  http://www.theguardian.com/world/shortcuts/2015/sep/16/the-refugee-who-isnt-welcome-after-all-muhammad-sajjad?CMP=share_btn_fb
17/09/2015, 08:56 - Shaggy added Phil
17/09/2015, 09:12 - Hannah Murphy: Hey uncle phil!
17/09/2015, 09:13 - Hannah Murphy: I'm friends with you on fb phil. But who is this guy?
17/09/2015, 09:13 - Hannah Murphy: <Media omitted>
17/09/2015, 09:15 - Krizia: Heyyy Phil!!! Welcome back!  Looking good! ;)
17/09/2015, 09:56 - Bongo: Lol maybe that's his Canadian alias
17/09/2015, 10:14 - Owen: I think he got married and changed his name. He liked Canada so much he needed a green card.
17/09/2015, 10:34 - Sam Roberts: Signed Teeg, that's messed up
17/09/2015, 10:34 - Sam Roberts: So hungover
17/09/2015, 10:38 - Tegan: Thanks dude.  Preciate it.
17/09/2015, 10:38 - Tegan: Also comiserations on your hangover.
17/09/2015, 10:40 - Dave: I didn't like how change.org asked for money in return for promoting the petition further.
17/09/2015, 10:40 - Tegan: I didn't notice that
17/09/2015, 10:41 - Sam Roberts: Didn't notice, but why not? That's the most basic of capitalism right?
17/09/2015, 10:42 - Sam Roberts: "We'd like to do a thing for you, but we will need some resources to do it"
17/09/2015, 10:48 - Owen: Doesn't feel like a petition should be a capitalist commodity though really does it?
17/09/2015, 10:48 - Sam Roberts: <Media omitted>
17/09/2015, 10:48 - Owen: Just like how votes shouldn't be a commodity.
17/09/2015, 10:49 - Sam Roberts: Neither should health. Let's stop the Nhs budget
17/09/2015, 10:51 - Sam Roberts: This isn't buying votes, it's buying awareness. The votes aren't a commodity
17/09/2015, 10:51 - Sam Roberts: Also lucha lucha lucha!
17/09/2015, 10:51 - Tegan: Agreed - they're selling the audience
17/09/2015, 10:51 - Tegan: Milk?
17/09/2015, 10:51 - Sam Roberts: Cassius! Fuck him up! Cassius!
17/09/2015, 10:52 - Sam Roberts: Got milk?
17/09/2015, 10:52 - Sam Roberts: Oh Mike, hehe yeah
17/09/2015, 10:54 - Owen: Sam your NHS point makes no sense.
17/09/2015, 10:54 - Owen: If we were in America it would.
17/09/2015, 10:54 - Sam Roberts: Things cost money
17/09/2015, 10:54 - Sam Roberts: It's painful but it's true
17/09/2015, 10:55 - Owen: Signing a petition doesn't, other than the ink.
17/09/2015, 10:56 - Dave: Don't even pretend you don't love the NHS Sam. Stop being polemic
17/09/2015, 10:56 - Tegan: What they think is worth money is how laughably easy it now is to get thousands of signatures on a petition
17/09/2015, 10:56 - Tegan: Without standing out in the street, probably in the rain, getting ignored about an issue you care about
17/09/2015, 10:58 - Sam Roberts: I do love the nhs, everyone loves the nhs, and we support the government paying a fuck load for it
17/09/2015, 10:59 - Sam Roberts: I'd imagine if you gave to that petition they'd stick some paid search behind it, or buy a bit of advertising space on some partner site or something
17/09/2015, 11:00 - Owen: Nah, they just send out a chain email to  anyone that's ever signed a petition.
17/09/2015, 11:00 - Owen: Clogging up my inbox.
17/09/2015, 11:01 - Sam Roberts: Everytime someone gives a fiver? Or they do nothing until they get ¬£10k for a project?
17/09/2015, 11:01 - Sam Roberts: How many do you receive?
17/09/2015, 11:04 - Owen: I receive loads.
17/09/2015, 11:08 - Sam Roberts: Like one every 3 seconds?
17/09/2015, 11:09 - Sam Roberts: Anyway a chain email still costs, at least a couple of hundred
17/09/2015, 11:09 - Sam Roberts: At least if it's more complicated than "give us money please" no pictures, no copy
17/09/2015, 11:10 - Owen: Sam can I pay you to shut up!?
17/09/2015, 11:10 - Sam Roberts: Yes
17/09/2015, 11:10 - Sam Roberts: Now you get it
17/09/2015, 11:11 - Owen: Will you accept any amount of money?
17/09/2015, 11:14 - Sam Roberts: I charge on a per minute basis
17/09/2015, 11:14 - Sam Roberts: OR for a grand I'll delete the group from my phone
17/09/2015, 11:16 - Owen: Hmmmm.
17/09/2015, 11:16 - Owen: What do I get for negative ¬£35.99
17/09/2015, 11:19 - Sam Roberts: Slap in the balls
17/09/2015, 11:20 - Mike SJ: Don't listen to him
17/09/2015, 11:20 - Mike SJ: I'll do that for free
17/09/2015, 11:28 - Owen: Sam would you actually pay me ¬£40 to slap me in the balls?
17/09/2015, 11:34 - Sam Roberts: No, you'll have to give me negative ¬£35.99
17/09/2015, 12:07 - Owen: Which is...
17/09/2015, 12:08 - Owen: You're a fucking accountant. I worry sometimes üòÑ
17/09/2015, 12:15 - Sam Roberts: üòÅ
17/09/2015, 13:15 - Phil: Haha. Owen receives loads.
17/09/2015, 13:36 - Shaggy: ‚òùÔ∏è
17/09/2015, 13:41 - Mike SJ: üëåüèª
17/09/2015, 13:49 - Owen: I don't understand. I didn't use the word load once!
17/09/2015, 13:50 - Mike SJ: <Media omitted>
17/09/2015, 13:50 - Shaggy: <Media omitted>
17/09/2015, 13:50 - Shaggy: Doh!
17/09/2015, 13:50 - Mike SJ: Hehe
17/09/2015, 14:00 - Owen: Oh that was ages ago.
17/09/2015, 14:12 - Tegan: Is there a plan for celebrating this evening?
17/09/2015, 14:15 - Mal: Loads
17/09/2015, 14:15 - Mal: I'm with a jet lagged American
17/09/2015, 14:16 - Mal: What are we celebrating
17/09/2015, 14:16 - Mal: The anniversary of the battle of Antietam
17/09/2015, 14:16 - Mal: ?
17/09/2015, 14:20 - Mike SJ: We got completely smashed last night when Phil arrived
17/09/2015, 14:20 - Sam Roberts: Return of the prodigal degenerate
17/09/2015, 14:20 - Mike SJ: Don't think any of us can drink tonight
17/09/2015, 14:45 - Owen: <Media omitted>
17/09/2015, 15:27 - Bongo: Second one seems alright
17/09/2015, 15:27 - Bongo: First one's very weird
17/09/2015, 15:31 - Bongo: What constitutes British values
17/09/2015, 15:31 - Bongo: Seems like they're setting you up for a disciplinary for whatever they want with that vagueness
17/09/2015, 15:37 - Owen: I think it is weird that the second one needs to be explicitly stated.
17/09/2015, 16:14 - Bongo: I had a teacher that bragged about running red lights
17/09/2015, 16:14 - Bongo: That's pretty much point number 2
17/09/2015, 16:15 - Bongo: So there's probably enough people doing it to have to explicitly say it
17/09/2015, 16:16 - Bongo: Just like on the American visa application when it asks you "have you ever committed genocide or planned to do so"
17/09/2015, 16:17 - Dave: That's how America got me
17/09/2015, 16:17 - Dave: So many plans
17/09/2015, 16:21 - Phil: Who's coming to Mexican wrestling on the morrow?
17/09/2015, 16:35 - Phil: This is a disappointing response.
17/09/2015, 16:50 - Bongo: Lucha! Lucha! Lucha!
17/09/2015, 17:22 - Tegan: No-one invited me
17/09/2015, 17:22 - Tegan: c town is totally hogging the phil
17/09/2015, 17:24 - Phil: You are hereby invited

18/09/2015, 08:14 - Tegan: By deed poll

08/10/2015, 08:29 - Mal: But it's ok, I'm taking her to freezing cold Gdansk instead
08/10/2015, 08:29 - Mal: She'll soon forget all about Africa
08/10/2015, 08:29 - Mal: Rosie feels homesick, despite that being a different country
08/10/2015, 09:01 - Phil: What are you doing up at sunrise teeg? Did you pass out on top of that there mountain?
08/10/2015, 09:38 - Mal: Has someone left the group? All the colors have changed
08/10/2015, 09:41 - Tegan: That was one option, Phil. We all opted for the healthier version of getting up at 4AM
08/10/2015, 09:42 - Tegan: I'm going for a tactical nap now
08/10/2015, 10:06 - Shaggy: Whatsapp changed, they are like grouping conversations too now

08/10/2015, 10:24 - Tegan: Good memory
08/10/2015, 10:24 - Shaggy: If you say several things in a row it divides things differently
08/10/2015, 10:24 - Tegan: Does it bother you? Is Bunny inherently red?
08/10/2015, 10:24 - Tegan: Let's try it
08/10/2015, 10:24 - Tegan: Looks the same
08/10/2015, 10:24 - Shaggy: <Media omitted>

08/10/2015, 20:05 - Joe Jarman: Whaaaat?
08/10/2015, 20:05 - Joe Jarman: Where?
08/10/2015, 20:10 - Owen: At the LSE lecture. It was either her, or someone who looked exactly like her.
08/10/2015, 22:54 - Shaggy: Saw you saw a pair of eyebrows
09/10/2015, 14:57 - Alex Bunn: The oktoberfest at the tobacco dock has been completely cancelled today
09/10/2015, 15:00 - Shaggy: Why?
09/10/2015, 15:01 - Alex Bunn: Card payment system issues i think
09/10/2015, 15:01 - Mal: Lolwut
09/10/2015, 15:01 - Mal: Hire cash machines
09/10/2015, 15:01 - Mal: Im sure thats a thing

09/10/2015, 16:52 - Mike SJ: I'm pretty sure we don't
09/10/2015, 16:53 - Mal: Nightmarish
09/10/2015, 16:54 - Mal: I still need to diagnose that that is the problem
09/10/2015, 16:54 - Mal: Damn you Elephone
09/10/2015, 16:54 - Mal: Mike do you guys have tiny screwdrivers?
09/10/2015, 16:55 - Shaggy: In their pants!
09/10/2015, 16:55 - Mal: Weey
09/10/2015, 16:56 - Owen: I do
09/10/2015, 16:56 - Owen: What's the problem Mal?
09/10/2015, 16:56 - Mal: Like the watch repair kit type ?
09/10/2015, 16:56 - Owen: I have one of those too
09/10/2015, 16:56 - Mal: Basically my headphone socket is not working
09/10/2015, 16:56 - Owen: On your phone?
09/10/2015, 16:56 - Mal: I suspect poor workmanship
09/10/2015, 16:57 - Mal: Yeah sadly haha
09/10/2015, 16:57 - Owen: That's a fucking mission to repair.
09/10/2015, 16:57 - Mal: Really
09/10/2015, 16:57 - Mal: That bad
09/10/2015, 16:57 - Owen: I could give it a go if you like
09/10/2015, 16:57 - Mal: That would be awesome if you could
09/10/2015, 16:57 - Mal: Thanks
09/10/2015, 16:57 - Owen: It's more likely the dac than the port itself
09/10/2015, 16:58 - Owen: Unless you bashed it or something?
09/10/2015, 16:58 - Mal: Not That I know of
09/10/2015, 16:58 - Mal: It worked lasr night
09/10/2015, 16:58 - Mal: Not this morning, weirdly
09/10/2015, 16:58 - Mal: Can't rule out a drop but don't recall one
09/10/2015, 16:58 - Owen: Definitely not a setting?
09/10/2015, 16:59 - Mal: Nah because if I really hold it in,  it works
09/10/2015, 16:59 - Owen: You can mute apps individually on some phones
09/10/2015, 16:59 - Owen: Ah ok
09/10/2015, 16:59 - Owen: That is the port then
09/10/2015, 16:59 - Owen: Have you tried different headphones?
09/10/2015, 16:59 - Mal: Yeah just now and earlier
09/10/2015, 17:00 - Mal: My first thought was headphones
09/10/2015, 17:00 - Mal: But sadly is not that simple
09/10/2015, 17:00 - Mal: I wish it was!
09/10/2015, 17:00 - Owen: Have you looked inside the socket with a bright light. It might be as simple as a bit of fluff pushing the headphone jack out a bit.
09/10/2015, 17:00 - Mal: Oh yeah could be I suppose haha
09/10/2015, 17:00 - Mal: I'll get the torch on it when I get home
09/10/2015, 17:01 - Mal: Cheers!
09/10/2015, 17:01 - Mal: It seems a common problem with this dodgy Chinese phone
09/10/2015, 17:01 - Owen: If that doesn't work give it to to me when we next meet
09/10/2015, 17:02 - Owen: I'm at bongo and shaggy's on sunday playing civ. So if you give it to sam or phil or one of them I can take it there.
09/10/2015, 17:02 - Owen: I love fixing things!
09/10/2015, 17:02 - Mal: Cool
09/10/2015, 17:05 - Mal: Thanks man,  I'll let you know how my basic troubleshooting works out
09/10/2015, 17:05 - Owen: If it's a common problem, it probably is the socket.
09/10/2015, 17:06 - Owen: Rather than fluff
09/10/2015, 17:06 - Mal: Yeah I mean is not completely broken, but a large number of frequencies don't play
09/10/2015, 17:06 - Mal: So it's as if the jack is not fully inserted
09/10/2015, 17:07 - Owen: I imagine that the sprung bits of metal that normally push into the jack have relaxed so that they don't make a good connection anymore.
09/10/2015, 17:08 - Mal: Yeah that seems likely.  Does not bode well as the phone is bayeux a month old
09/10/2015, 17:08 - Mal: Varely
09/10/2015, 17:13 - Owen: Barely?
09/10/2015, 17:13 - Owen: Or tapestry?
09/10/2015, 17:13 - Mal: Barely haha
09/10/2015, 17:13 - AlanWright: Owen, do you know how to replace laptop screens aswell?
09/10/2015, 17:14 - Owen: Oh god. What have I done.
09/10/2015, 17:14 - Mal: I have actually seen that particular tapestry
09/10/2015, 17:14 - Dave: Owen, my pack mule is depressed. Can you assist?
09/10/2015, 17:14 - Owen: Yeah probably Alan. I have never done it. But fixing things is basically about having the confidence you can fix your own mistakes
09/10/2015, 17:15 - Owen: I might be able to ASSist Dave.
09/10/2015, 17:15 - Dave: Nice
09/10/2015, 17:15 - Dave: üòé
09/10/2015, 17:16 - Owen: We could turn him from pack mule to prozac mule.
09/10/2015, 17:17 - Owen: As long as it donkey me up all night I'll try fixing him.
09/10/2015, 17:18 - Owen: Sometimes you just need to shout at these pack mules until you are horse
09/10/2015, 17:19 - Owen: As long as you don't equ-whine about it if I fail.
09/10/2015, 17:21 - Owen: You better like these puns. Personally I think they are horseome!
09/10/2015, 17:27 - AlanWright: I hope these horse puns dont go on all knight
09/10/2015, 19:17 - Lorna: Is anyone about tonight?
09/10/2015, 19:19 - Sam Roberts: So full of chicken wings
09/10/2015, 19:20 - Dave: Uxbride?
09/10/2015, 19:20 - Dave: Uxbridge?
09/10/2015, 19:20 - Mal: What a surprise
09/10/2015, 19:21 - AlanWright: Out with work
09/10/2015, 19:21 - AlanWright: Cant believe my horse pun didnt get a good reception
09/10/2015, 19:21 - Mal: It did but I didn't want it all to go to your head
09/10/2015, 19:22 - Mal: <Media omitted>
09/10/2015, 19:22 - Dave: Ha
09/10/2015, 19:23 - Dave: That's great
09/10/2015, 19:23 - Dave: I'm thinking of going to the cinema tonight. What should i see?
09/10/2015, 19:24 - Mike SJ: @ Alan : You whinny some you lose some
09/10/2015, 19:24 - Sam Roberts: Seems like you could do with some back up Alan
09/10/2015, 19:24 - Sam Roberts: Sometimes you just need a bit of support
09/10/2015, 19:24 - Sam Roberts: Maybe you should call in the cavalry
09/10/2015, 19:25 - Dave: Choices are: legend, suffragettes, martian and sicario
09/10/2015, 19:25 - Mike SJ: Martian obvs
09/10/2015, 19:25 - AlanWright: Yes sam. Im having a mare
09/10/2015, 19:26 - Mike SJ: We'll bale you out
09/10/2015, 19:27 - Dave: All this horsing around is getting tiring
09/10/2015, 19:28 - Mike SJ: Stop being a neigh-sayer
09/10/2015, 19:28 - AlanWright: Haha
09/10/2015, 19:28 - AlanWright: Thats great mike
09/10/2015, 19:30 - Lorna: I saw Martian, it was good! A bit cheesy in places.
09/10/2015, 19:31 - Lorna: And great horse puns everyone üëèüèª
09/10/2015, 19:43 - AlanWright: They got a bit foal towards the end. But it was fun whilst it lasted
09/10/2015, 19:45 - Owen: I think you mean it got a bit stable towards the end.
09/10/2015, 19:47 - Mike SJ: Booooo
09/10/2015, 19:49 - Mike SJ: I am decent at puns, but also hate them
09/10/2015, 19:49 - Mike SJ: Please stop everyone
09/10/2015, 19:55 - Owen: I canter help it, it's trot possible to stop, I gal-hope you can forgive me.
09/10/2015, 19:58 - Shaggy removed Owen
09/10/2015, 19:58 - Shaggy: That was terrible
09/10/2015, 19:59 - Shaggy added Owen
09/10/2015, 20:00 - Owen: Bull-ocks to that shaggy, you shouldn't re-moo-ve me just because you cow-n't stand my puns.
09/10/2015, 20:02 - Mike SJ: I feel you're taking a quantity over quality approach
09/10/2015, 20:03 - Owen: <Media omitted>
09/10/2015, 20:23 - Sam Roberts: Cow him into submission
09/10/2015, 20:23 - Sam Roberts: Keep going Owen
09/10/2015, 20:29 - AlanWright: Dont get sheepish now Owen
09/10/2015, 20:43 - Mal: Oh deer
09/10/2015, 20:54 - Lorna: Now these are just puns without a porpoise
09/10/2015, 20:55 - Owen: I'm having a whale of a time
09/10/2015, 21:38 - Martha: Looks like we'll just have to grin and bear it
09/10/2015, 22:01 - Owen: Is that a bear pun Marth? Huge mistake.
09/10/2015, 22:37 - Mal: Bear  puns  n that

12/10/2015, 18:17 - Phil: There is no God!
12/10/2015, 18:18 - Tegan: Previously suspected, now confirmed
12/10/2015, 18:20 - Bongo: Lol poor tegs
12/10/2015, 18:20 - Bongo: That looks hella annoying
12/10/2015, 18:21 - Tegan: I once laughed at bear grylls for having a similar disfigurement, so I have to be amused by this
12/10/2015, 18:22 - Tegan: Also is pretty much gone down now - I didn't share this morning when I feared it might be permanent

13/10/2015, 22:24 - Joe Jarman: Are you coming to the party friday Angela???
13/10/2015, 22:38 - Mal: Ed has been banging on about it haha
13/10/2015, 23:01 - Angela: No can do this Friday I'm afraid, got work on Saturday. Serial is the best podcast ever which you should listen to and get obsessed with
13/10/2015, 23:06 - Mal: Controversial
13/10/2015, 23:21 - Bongo: Nobody tells me what to do!
13/10/2015, 23:21 - Bongo: But I might give that a go I've run out of things to listen to
13/10/2015, 23:22 - Bongo: I'm an old technophobic man when it comes to podcasts, do you just dl them or do you have to be online?
13/10/2015, 23:24 - Mal: Dl
13/10/2015, 23:24 - Lorna: Download them. And serial is awesome. I read that the follow up just repeats a lot of serial though and is sort of shit
13/10/2015, 23:25 - Mal: Isn't it supposed to be based on an entirely different case?
13/10/2015, 23:25 - Mal: But yeah
13/10/2015, 23:25 - Mal: Once you've read murder on the orient express you've read them all...
13/10/2015, 23:26 - Lorna: Nope. The same producers are making another series on a different thing, but that's not out yet
13/10/2015, 23:27 - Angela: I just listened to episode 1, it's way more detailed and slightly confusing but wasn't repetitive
13/10/2015, 23:28 - Angela: It more goes into what other witnesses said that weren't featured in serial
14/10/2015, 09:01 - Alex Bunn: You can give it a test run Ang!
14/10/2015, 09:04 - Mal: Yeah haha
14/10/2015, 09:06 - Owen: My pupils are really facing the wrath of a grumpy mr james today.
14/10/2015, 09:06 - Owen: I have been so mean to them.
14/10/2015, 09:06 - Alex Bunn: Its only 6 past 9
14/10/2015, 09:07 - Owen: They are a bunch of fucking morons bunn!!!
14/10/2015, 09:08 - Hannah Murphy: Are you just ignoring them and whatsapping Owen!
14/10/2015, 09:10 - Mal: Yeah have you even taken register yet haha
14/10/2015, 09:17 - Owen: School starts at 8:30
14/10/2015, 09:23 - Mal: Fair one

14/10/2015, 09:23 - Mal: What time do you let them out
14/10/2015, 09:23 - Owen: 3:30
14/10/2015, 09:27 - Mal: Ah just like in my day
14/10/2015, 09:32 - Mal: Where does the extra half hour go
14/10/2015, 09:32 - Mal: Actually probably only ten minutes in reality
14/10/2015, 09:32 - Mal: So the black hole of lunchtimes I guess
14/10/2015, 09:36 - Owen: Longer lessons
14/10/2015, 09:36 - Owen: We have 7 45-minute lessons
14/10/2015, 10:05 - Shaggy: Back in my day lessons were 1 hour long, assuming they weren't doubles
14/10/2015, 10:05 - Shaggy: Also to begin with I thought you were talking about your eyes and was confused
14/10/2015, 10:08 - Owen: Our doubles are 1:30
14/10/2015, 10:08 - Owen: It's not so much longer lessons. Just more of them
14/10/2015, 10:08 - Owen: I had 5 1 hour lessons when I was in school.
14/10/2015, 10:26 - Mal: Ah we had  10 x 30
14/10/2015, 10:26 - Mal: But some are doubles
14/10/2015, 16:31 - Hannah Murphy: Check out this dude in the office today!
14/10/2015, 16:31 - Hannah Murphy: <Media omitted>
14/10/2015, 17:01 - Tegan: Is that a remote meeting aid? Do you get to control it remotely? Why??
14/10/2015, 17:05 - Mal: Is he controlling it
14/10/2015, 17:05 - Mal: Is that just a stand of is it actually capable of moving
14/10/2015, 17:18 - Joe Jarman: Doublerobotics.com
14/10/2015, 17:20 - Mal: Sick
14/10/2015, 17:20 - Mal: I need one
14/10/2015, 17:20 - Mal: Everyone needs one
14/10/2015, 17:20 - Mal: Government should subsidise that shit massively
14/10/2015, 17:21 - Tegan: Ridiculous :)
14/10/2015, 17:22 - Tegan: If the whole world is telerobotting in...
14/10/2015, 17:22 - Tegan: Whose grooming the badgers for the badger parade?
14/10/2015, 17:22 - Owen: Wasn't that on community?
14/10/2015, 17:22 - Mal: Could well have been
14/10/2015, 17:23 - Owen: But with prisoners doing distance learning?
14/10/2015, 17:27 - Tegan: Hannah, how's the motion? Does it keep bumping into desks?
14/10/2015, 17:29 - Mal: Great idea
14/10/2015, 17:48 - Hannah Murphy: There is a lady here controlling it
14/10/2015, 17:49 - Hannah Murphy: It seems to me like an iPad stuck on a Segway
14/10/2015, 17:50 - Mal: I think that's almost exactly what it is
14/10/2015, 17:52 - Tegan: That's exactly how I described it to my friend here
14/10/2015, 17:53 - Phil: If you glue guns to it you have a primitive terminator.
14/10/2015, 18:03 - Phil: <Media omitted>
14/10/2015, 18:16 - Tegan: Trogdor?

14/10/2015, 18:16 - Bongo: Burninator
14/10/2015, 18:17 - Tegan: If I could have my ipad face on an s, with a more different s, and a beefy arm, that would be badass
14/10/2015, 18:18 - Shaggy: Looks like a vagina with huge arms is clamping that Segway
14/10/2015, 18:18 - Tegan: Yikes
14/10/2015, 22:29 - Joe Jarman: <Media omitted>
14/10/2015, 22:29 - Alex Bunn: Hahahahaha
14/10/2015, 22:29 - AlanWright: So true
14/10/2015, 22:44 - Hannah Murphy: If anyone's free Saturday next week, I'm playing my squeezebox and singing with a friends band at this big night with lots of bands, DJs and theatre: https://www.facebook.com/events/509051399264952/
14/10/2015, 22:45 - Hannah Murphy: At the queen of hoxton
14/10/2015, 22:46 - Hannah Murphy: Most importantly, the night is called Cat Lovers
14/10/2015, 22:50 - Phil: üëçüò∫
14/10/2015, 22:54 - Hannah Murphy: üòªüòªüòª
14/10/2015, 23:41 - Vanessa: Hannah how do you get on the guest list?
15/10/2015, 08:35 - Hannah Murphy: I'll ask now
15/10/2015, 08:42 - Tegan: I saw that on Facebook - from looking at the poster I assumed it was a disco-ball-suit-electro-boy type night
15/10/2015, 08:42 - Tegan: This sounds better :)
15/10/2015, 08:46 - Hannah Murphy: Think it's a mixtcha :)
15/10/2015, 08:49 - Tegan: üëÜüëÜüëÜüôÖ
15/10/2015, 08:50 - Tegan: (There is no emoji for the 'peace fingers glide past eyes' dance)
15/10/2015, 08:50 - Mal: ‚úåüèª
15/10/2015, 08:50 - Mal: There are peace fingers though
15/10/2015, 08:51 - Tegan: They need to be rotatable
15/10/2015, 08:51 - Mal: Yeah
15/10/2015, 08:51 - Mal: Make it happen
15/10/2015, 08:51 - Tegan: I'm sure whatsapp is listing
15/10/2015, 08:51 - Tegan: Listening
15/10/2015, 08:55 - Mal: If not, your keyboard is
15/10/2015, 08:55 - Mal: So I try to throw it off every now and then
15/10/2015, 08:56 - Mal: Boobs

15/10/2015, 08:56 - Mal: Haha
15/10/2015, 08:56 - Mal: That's the spirit
15/10/2015, 08:58 - Mal: ‚òùüèΩüí•
15/10/2015, 08:59 - Mal: My Google searches would surely confuse mi5
15/10/2015, 08:59 - Owen: You know there's that bit in the wire where there's lots of pager activity and macnulty says "well, something went down last night"... The horde is like that sometimes... I'm like "120 new messages, something went down last night." Then I actually get down to reading them.
15/10/2015, 09:00 - Mal: How does nuclear fission work?
15/10/2015, 09:00 - Mal: Does stevie wonder know he's black?
15/10/2015, 09:00 - Mal: In fact is he even blind?! I've seen him catching a microphone!
15/10/2015, 09:42 - Alex Bunn: He's a jedi
15/10/2015, 13:20 - Bongo: <Media omitted>
15/10/2015, 13:20 - Bongo: Highly seductive safety instructions on wizzair
15/10/2015, 13:20 - Bongo: I was really hoping for another comical one like we found on the flight to India lol
15/10/2015, 13:35 - Alex Bunn: Where you flying to?
15/10/2015, 13:40 - Owen: What the fuck is she even doing in most of these instructions. They aren't clear at all. The artist clearly spent too much time perfecting her booty to actually draw the instructive bits
15/10/2015, 13:45 - Phil: Well I wasn't going to download the image but you sold it to me Owen.
15/10/2015, 13:46 - Phil: 400kb well spent

15/10/2015, 15:08 - Mal: Yeah that is gash
15/10/2015, 15:08 - Mal: This along with the train and stadium ban is all because they have their tongues in the asses of Philip morris
15/10/2015, 15:08 - Mal: Or whomever
15/10/2015, 17:20 - Bongo: What other disaster related comments?
15/10/2015, 17:20 - Bongo: I've landed so none of the speculative disasters came true
15/10/2015, 17:28 - Phil: Unless you've been dead all along!
15/10/2015, 17:32 - Lorna: Woah
15/10/2015, 17:43 - Mal: No I didn't bother with them,  it was an invitation to fill the blanks
15/10/2015, 17:45 - Mal: Create your own aviation disaster adventure story
15/10/2015, 17:49 - Phil: If you want to fly over war torn Ukraine turn to page 168.
15/10/2015, 17:52 - Mal: Funnily enough, page 168 is th is

15/10/2015, 17:54 - Mal: That's generous
15/10/2015, 21:13 - Jimena: Did u guys now next week will be the day marty mcfly travelled to in back to the future 2?

15/10/2015, 21:18 - Jimena: I call the purple head brace

17/10/2015, 18:36 - Mal: That Jay sounds like a right wrong un
17/10/2015, 18:38 - Owen: Anand is guilty as fuck!
17/10/2015, 18:39 - Mal: I think he must be, why is nobody sounding even in the slightest bit freaked out? If any of my exs were found strangled and in a shallow grave, even the one who is a Grade a arsehole, I would still be very upset about it
17/10/2015, 18:40 - Mal: Unless there is just a 3rd party
17/10/2015, 18:40 - Mal: I don't see who else could've done it.  Weirdly Jay never really seems to be an actual suspect?! How the fuck not?!
17/10/2015, 18:40 - Mal: Sigh
17/10/2015, 18:41 - Mal: Justice never sleeps.
17/10/2015, 18:45 - Owen: Jay was definitely involved and is downplaying his involvement. Anand can't say how Jay was involved without implicating himself.
17/10/2015, 18:48 - Mal: Yeah haha
17/10/2015, 18:48 - Mal: I need to do the last 5 or 6 episodes then I will pass final judgement
17/10/2015, 18:48 - Mal: But it's all pretty weird
17/10/2015, 18:51 - Sam Roberts: I'm getting round to it, no spoilers please üòä
17/10/2015, 18:52 - Mal: Guilty
17/10/2015, 18:52 - Mal: They're all guilty
17/10/2015, 19:10 - Mike SJ: Anand probly did it, shouldn't have been convicted though
17/10/2015, 19:25 - Angela: I'm listening to the serial follow up called undisclosed podcast, the plot thickens. It thickens very much
18/10/2015, 00:13 - Alex Bunn: So good!
18/10/2015, 10:16 - Eliza: Has anybody watched The Jinx? It's an HBO true crime series - if you liked Serial I would thoroughly recommend it.
18/10/2015, 10:17 - Alex Bunn: Yes! Also awesome!!
18/10/2015, 10:28 - Eliza: The ending!!
18/10/2015, 10:32 - Bongo: There's an ending?! No spoilers!
18/10/2015, 10:38 - Eliza: Such an ending!
18/10/2015, 10:38 - Owen: At one point it ends. Yes
18/10/2015, 10:40 - Alex Bunn: The whole thing is amazing and the ending is so sweet

18/10/2015, 18:45 - Mal: Owen did you stay in the projector room
18/10/2015, 18:45 - Mal: Directly below the upstairs toilet the leak was coming through quote severely
18/10/2015, 18:46 - Mal: Should've gotten you involved in the project actually !
18/10/2015, 18:54 - Joe Jarman: Landlord's brother had his head in his hands when he came round after observing the mess
18/10/2015, 18:56 - Mal: Shit haha
18/10/2015, 19:52 - Lora: Thanks for the rec Eliza, Matt & I have been watching jinx all eve. On ep. 3!! üò±
18/10/2015, 20:41 - Owen: It's amazing isn't it!
18/10/2015, 20:42 - Alex Bunn: Yes Lora!
18/10/2015, 20:42 - Owen: Robert Durst is the creepiest mother fucker ever!
18/10/2015, 20:43 - Alex Bunn: He's a psycho i think
18/10/2015, 20:49 - Owen: Most def
18/10/2015, 20:49 - Owen: The guy shows no emotion to anything.
18/10/2015, 21:13 - Lora: 2 more to go!!!
18/10/2015, 21:20 - Lora: Idiotic Texans üî´
18/10/2015, 21:43 - Owen: No head means no crime apparently!
18/10/2015, 21:44 - Owen: It's so bizarre.
19/10/2015, 10:39 - Bongo: "Man dies shortly after biting a fellow passenger on an airplane"
19/10/2015, 10:39 - Bongo: Bring on the zombie apocalypse
19/10/2015, 11:07 - Phil: Fuck that. I don't even have a crossbow yet.
19/10/2015, 11:23 - Mike SJ: Airline food #amirite
19/10/2015, 11:23 - Mal: Haha yeah
19/10/2015, 11:23 - Mal: I did wonder
19/10/2015, 12:06 - Owen: I call rabies!
19/10/2015, 12:07 - Sam Roberts: Maybe the guy just looked delicious
19/10/2015, 12:25 - Bongo: I wonder what the cause of death was though
19/10/2015, 12:25 - Bongo: Maybe it was just a massively bad drug trip
19/10/2015, 12:25 - Bongo: Or maybe he died of embarrassment
19/10/2015, 12:27 - Tegan: This is definitely how it begins though. ..
19/10/2015, 12:27 - Tegan: Do we have an updated z day plan?
19/10/2015, 12:28 - Tegan: Where was he coming from? Going to?  How long have we got??
19/10/2015, 12:29 - Mike SJ: Go to the Winchester, have a nice cold pint, wait for all this to blow over
19/10/2015, 12:50 - Bongo: He was going to ireland from Portugal, I don't think we have much time
19/10/2015, 12:50 - Bongo: There must be a zombie equation somewhere for the rate of infection
19/10/2015, 13:00 - Owen: P(z) = ¬£Nz / k-1
19/10/2015, 14:00 - Tegan: Then it's already here...
19/10/2015, 14:05 - Phil: Might have just been a Portuguese. Hard to tell the difference.
19/10/2015, 14:06 - Phil: Although I'd still advise stocking up on crossbows.
19/10/2015, 14:09 - Sam Roberts: And hiding all your mirrors
19/10/2015, 14:13 - Bongo: Is Suarez Portuguese?
19/10/2015, 14:13 - Bongo: That would explain all the biting
19/10/2015, 14:19 - Mal: Sadly that would be too simple
19/10/2015, 14:20 - Mal: RECKON suarez is soares in Portuguese too haha
19/10/2015, 14:20 - Mal: But I assume he was mashed up on bath salts or whatever
19/10/2015, 18:06 - Owen: Sleep Owen does not arrived
19/10/2015, 19:24 - AlanWright: Hello horde. What vpn do people use in chrome / firefix nowadays?

20/10/2015, 12:42 - Joe Jarman: I'm still smashing hola
20/10/2015, 12:42 - Joe Jarman: Blown out of proportion
20/10/2015, 12:45 - Sam Roberts: I had a job interview with hide my ass
20/10/2015, 12:45 - Sam Roberts: It's all owned by this super wide eyed, just out of uni kid who has no idea what to do with the insane amount of money it now generates
20/10/2015, 12:46 - Sam Roberts: Or at least it was a couple of years ago
20/10/2015, 12:54 - Lora: Yea he looks like he's 5
20/10/2015, 12:54 - Lora: Kinda cool tho
20/10/2015, 14:19 - Owen: What are people up to tonight? Pub?

20/10/2015, 15:15 - AlanWright: Super busy this week i'm afraid
20/10/2015, 15:52 - Owen: I have to write some meaningless letters in a spreadsheet.
20/10/2015, 15:52 - Owen: 6:30 or 7ish?
20/10/2015, 16:13 - Lorna: OK. I'll probably be there by 6:30, and hopefully you/ someone will find me soon after
20/10/2015, 16:13 - Owen: Yep
20/10/2015, 16:14 - Owen: I am knackered, though, so there is about a 5% chance that I'll fall asleep on the train and end up in endinburgh
20/10/2015, 16:16 - Eliza: I can come for a drink or two - I'll need to head off about 7.30ish. But I can at least get you there.
20/10/2015, 16:17 - Owen: Yey!
20/10/2015, 16:18 - Owen: A human alarm clock will accompany me to the pub
20/10/2015, 16:21 - Lorna: The day is saved

20/10/2015, 19:28 - Owen: Come along han han
22/10/2015, 08:28 - Bongo: It‚Äôs true they say that all‚Äôs fair in love and war, but actually, the use of hollow-point ammunition and mustard gas is banned in both.
22/10/2015, 08:30 - Phil: Also Mario Cart
22/10/2015, 08:31 - Mal: I consider sniffer dogg also cheating
22/10/2015, 08:32 - Mal: Mano a mano you'd like to think you have a fair chance of blagging a cop, but having a chain of doggs across the exit of Farringdon station is cheating
22/10/2015, 08:58 - Tegan: Confirmation that C-town be the bad lands: https://www.google.com/maps/d/viewer?mid=zVJdgT_1_IuU.k79WqODOKaI8&hl=en_US
22/10/2015, 09:07 - Mike SJ: Plaistow mandem lmao

22/10/2015, 09:08 - Mike SJ: So what colour do I need to wear/not wear?
22/10/2015, 09:11 - Owen: Wear rainbow just to be safe. An additional benefit is that then you'll be part of the most fabulous gang ever!
22/10/2015, 09:12 - Tegan: Sound advice, O
22/10/2015, 09:13 - Mike SJ: Lol

22/10/2015, 09:14 - Mike SJ: Shabong, could I interest you in joining the Latino Callejeros Cartel? They sound like they've got moxy
22/10/2015, 09:14 - Owen: I didn't spend my youth listening to N.W.A just to not put into practice everything I learned teegs.
22/10/2015, 09:15 - Tegan: I am not intimidated by any of the gangs who call themselves 'boys'
22/10/2015, 09:16 - Tegan: At least from a safe distance
22/10/2015, 09:23 - Lorna: Fellows court sound pretty lame.
22/10/2015, 09:24 - Tegan: They're a jacobean gang
22/10/2015, 09:24 - Tegan: Ruffs n that
22/10/2015, 09:25 - Lorna: Fight turf wars by jousting
22/10/2015, 09:28 - Mal: Did I look at the wrong map

22/10/2015, 10:30 - Phil: Paki panthers! I wonder if they'd let me join.
22/10/2015, 10:34 - Mal: Probably
22/10/2015, 10:34 - Mal: They sound pretty inclusive
23/10/2015, 16:51 - Shaggy: http://www.google.com/patents/US5443036
23/10/2015, 17:39 - Tegan: Now just wait for the money to roll in....
23/10/2015, 17:39 - Tegan: Is this why my Facebook wall is recently switching to dog videos?
23/10/2015, 17:45 - Bongo: <Media omitted>
23/10/2015, 17:54 - Mal: Ye
24/10/2015, 16:45 - Tegan: How's the weather in Mexico, Sam and Kriz? All safe and that?
24/10/2015, 17:09 - Mike SJ: <Media omitted>
24/10/2015, 17:09 - Mike SJ: In case they don't see it
24/10/2015, 17:17 - Shaggy: Hurricane Sam
24/10/2015, 20:03 - Phil: Anyone up for drawing stuff with light + long exposure pictures tomorrow?
24/10/2015, 20:17 - Eliza: ‚úã
24/10/2015, 20:25 - Owen: üê°
24/10/2015, 20:47 - Tegan: We'll probably be able to make one of the slightly late ones - will let you know tomorrow
24/10/2015, 23:26 - Owen: The satisfying feeling of finally finding a comfy position in bed - http://i.imgur.com/GZcsgbG.gifv
24/10/2015, 23:36 - Luana: Awwwn
Hahahaha üòÑüòçüòÑ
25/10/2015, 11:33 - Tegan: With a fair wind and a modicum of luck, we should be moored up within the hour
25/10/2015, 11:33 - Phil: Can you get there for 14.00?
25/10/2015, 11:34 - Mal: Where you mooring
25/10/2015, 12:00 - Tegan: I was wrong. .. I forgot about camden
25/10/2015, 12:00 - Tegan: Unless there's a space around regents Park...
25/10/2015, 13:48 - AlanWright: Anyone interested in this brixton academy event for nye?  http://ram-nye.eventgenius.co.uk/
25/10/2015, 14:01 - Owen: Public NYE is always awful. I am a big proponent of the small house party that you have low expectations of which then turns out to be really fun.
25/10/2015, 14:05 - Mike SJ: That lineup is crazy though
25/10/2015, 14:06 - Shaggy: It is a good line up, but I agree with Owen
25/10/2015, 14:09 - Mike SJ: I had an amazing night at the Junction in Cambridge a few years ago, it can be done
25/10/2015, 14:12 - Mal: Noisia
25/10/2015, 14:12 - Mal: Sickness
25/10/2015, 14:12 - Mal: But Owen has a point
25/10/2015, 14:12 - Mal: Nye overhyped
25/10/2015, 14:12 - Mal: I've only been disappointed with nye raves!
25/10/2015, 14:12 - Mal: No Andy and no mind vortex either
25/10/2015, 14:12 - Mal: Is barely a ram night
25/10/2015, 14:43 - Mal: Not meaning to piss on your bbq there Alan haha
25/10/2015, 14:47 - AlanWright: Still an awesome lineup though
25/10/2015, 14:47 - AlanWright: Very tempted
25/10/2015, 14:47 - AlanWright: But if nobody goes, it won't be that great
25/10/2015, 15:33 - Bongo: House party!
25/10/2015, 15:34 - Bongo: They're always fun
25/10/2015, 15:34 - Bongo: There hasn't been a single party that hasn't included champagne, blood or other antics
25/10/2015, 16:45 - Alex Bunn: Whats the plan, euston ppl?
26/10/2015, 09:35 - Mike SJ: <Media omitted>

26/10/2015, 14:25 - Mal: There's a wicked party on a boat on Friday
26/10/2015, 14:26 - Mal: The ss chum guzzler haha
26/10/2015, 14:31 - Phil: I'll have it Alan
26/10/2015, 14:33 - AlanWright: I guess that's why bunn can't make it anymore...
26/10/2015, 14:33 - AlanWright: The ticket is yours phil :)
26/10/2015, 14:34 - Phil: üåû

27/10/2015, 11:22 - Mal: The new conservative mp for Cambridge south.
27/10/2015, 11:32 - Phil: I'd like to privatize her nhs if you know what I mean
27/10/2015, 11:36 - Owen: I'd show her my private finance initiative.
27/10/2015, 12:19 - Joe Jarman: Going to see spectre at west india key tomorrow 630 showing
27/10/2015, 12:19 - Joe Jarman: If anyone fancies it!
27/10/2015, 12:23 - Mike SJ: 630 really?
27/10/2015, 12:23 - Mal: No good
27/10/2015, 12:23 - Joe Jarman: Yuuuuup
27/10/2015, 12:23 - Mal: Why don't you go at lunchtime
27/10/2015, 12:24 - Mal: Since that's basically lunchtime
27/10/2015, 12:24 - Joe Jarman: I mean it will start at 645
27/10/2015, 12:24 - Mal: Still no good
27/10/2015, 12:24 - Mal: Actually it's probably possible
27/10/2015, 12:24 - Joe Jarman: Home by 9 in time for hot chocolate and a hot water bottle

27/10/2015, 12:26 - Joe Jarman: Madness
27/10/2015, 12:26 - Joe Jarman: 528 out the door
27/10/2015, 12:27 - Joe Jarman: That's how you get a promotion
27/10/2015, 12:27 - Joe Jarman: üòù
27/10/2015, 12:34 - Alex Bunn: Lol
27/10/2015, 13:03 - Dave: That's the new tory MP who spoke out over tax credits
27/10/2015, 13:04 - Dave: That's your fact of the day
27/10/2015, 13:08 - Phil: Well then I'd like to congratulate her on not participating in bipartisan politics.
27/10/2015, 13:08 - Phil: If you know what I mean
27/10/2015, 13:09 - Dave: Brap
27/10/2015, 13:16 - Mal: Yeah there would be footprints on the ceiling after I was done with her
27/10/2015, 13:16 - Mal: Erx
27/10/2015, 13:16 - Mal: Etc
27/10/2015, 13:19 - Tegan: I have to despair
27/10/2015, 13:19 - Tegan: Because it's right and it's expected of me
27/10/2015, 13:24 - Mal: You'll probably love this site then tegan

27/10/2015, 13:35 - Tegan: Did you scroll down to the top 10 Mal?
27/10/2015, 13:36 - Tegan: Equal ops site for men. And maybe women with bicurious leanings.
27/10/2015, 13:38 - Mal: No actually I haven't yet looked in depth, is it good?
27/10/2015, 13:44 - Mal: In fact having had a cursory glance, I'm not sure there's a lot to go by on there. I'd imagine it's mps interns voting for them as instructed
27/10/2015, 13:44 - Mal: When I first looked around election time there were more men in the upper echelons
27/10/2015, 13:44 - Mal: Ha, that's weird
27/10/2015, 13:44 - Mal: Now is dominated by females
27/10/2015, 13:44 - Mal: Where's your glass ceiling now ladies?
27/10/2015, 13:45 - Mal: That's exactly what my interns would be doing
27/10/2015, 13:45 - Tegan: Yup, women can take heart. They may not be the best paid or the most respected people in politics, but it's undisputed that they are some of the sexiest.
27/10/2015, 14:01 - Mal: I dunno,  that siddiq khan is a silver fox
27/10/2015, 14:01 - Mal: Haha
27/10/2015, 14:03 - Mal: To be fair you can count the number of current politicians I respect on one hand
27/10/2015, 14:05 - Tegan: He is like a Asian Phillip Schofield
27/10/2015, 14:07 - Tegan: Noted that you respect none of then. And that you disrespect less than half of them more ludely and vocally than the others.
27/10/2015, 14:13 - Mal: Do you mean lewd
27/10/2015, 14:13 - Mal: Ly
27/10/2015, 14:13 - Mal: Or rudely
27/10/2015, 14:13 - Mal: To be honest what I really want is diverse representation
27/10/2015, 14:14 - Tegan: In terms of sexiness?
27/10/2015, 14:14 - Tegan: Seems fair
27/10/2015, 14:15 - Mal: Hahd Yeah
27/10/2015, 14:15 - Tegan: It's the Zap Brannigan model of galatic politics
27/10/2015, 14:15 - Mal: Various exotic aliens

29/10/2015, 15:03 - Mal: Poorly balanced individual
29/10/2015, 15:05 - Tegan: Poorly balanced individuals sound less boring to me
29/10/2015, 15:11 - Mal: Well, you've got neanderthal types at one end,  and ridiculous social awkward goons at the other, I assume
29/10/2015, 15:11 - Mal: If you want to hang with either demographic, go right ahead haha

08/11/2015, 13:47 - Hannah Murphy: I'm dying a death on the sofa I'm afraid Alan
08/11/2015, 14:37 - AlanWright: No probs guys. Im struggling to make it out myself today!

08/11/2015, 14:44 - Angela: Sorry Alan, bit late for me, I have dinner plans xx
08/11/2015, 16:38 - Sam Roberts: Happy birthday bro! I'm just about out of bed...

09/11/2015, 14:42 - Shaggy: Wooo awesome
09/11/2015, 14:44 - Mal: I hope it works cos otherwise I'll look a right muppets.  Looks like it's added to the payment section.
09/11/2015, 14:53 - Sam Roberts: Mal the Haxx0r
09/11/2015, 14:55 - Mal: To be fair uber deserve it
09/11/2015, 15:32 - Joe Jarman: Off your first ride?
09/11/2015, 15:33 - Mal: Apparently not
09/11/2015, 15:33 - Mal: That's just what that message says,but it's now in your promo codes
09/11/2015, 15:34 - Mal: I'm just sharing the love haha
09/11/2015, 15:37 - Mal: Is on mine under active promos so presumably it will come off next ride
09/11/2015, 15:38 - Mal: If it doesn't work then that sucks but you'd think it wouldn't add to my list of active promos
09/11/2015, 18:16 - Mal: There was some serial news today  for those who listened to the podcast
09/11/2015, 18:17 - Owen: Yeah?...
09/11/2015, 18:17 - Mal: Retrial tings a gwan
09/11/2015, 18:18 - Mal: Or appeal. Whatever the correct terminology is
09/11/2015, 18:18 - Owen: Really? So they will both go down this time üòÉ guilty fuckers.
09/11/2015, 18:18 - Mal: Appeal is successful
09/11/2015, 18:18 - Mal: Haha yeah and Mr s
09/11/2015, 18:19 - Owen: üéµMr Füéµ
09/11/2015, 18:25 - Mal: Haha yeah
09/11/2015, 22:57 - AlanWright: Hi all. Would anyone be up for doing some kind of national park trip over the bank holiday weekend at the beginning of May? I'm thinking leave on the Saturday morning, come back on the Tuesday afternoon.¬† The monday is a bank holiday so just need to take 1 optional day off on the tuesday, and that gives us 3 nights somewhere.¬† I was thinking Lake District, but anywhere else apart from Snowdonia or Peak District will work (I did both of those in previous years with some non horde people who might be coming on this trip).¬† If we get a group of 15ish people, i've found a place that will work out at ¬£45 each for 3 nights in the lake district.¬† It's a bunkhouse - basic, but self-catered, so will be super cheap.¬† It's also next door to the village pub.¬† The only other cost is car rental / petrol, which should be ¬£60/¬£70ish each for the weekend.¬† If we decide against Lake District, i'm sure we can find a similar place somewhere else.¬† So, that's the general plan so far.¬† Let me know if you're interested
09/11/2015, 23:08 - Joe Jarman: I'm up for it
09/11/2015, 23:08 - Joe Jarman: üëçüèª
09/11/2015, 23:09 - Joe Jarman: A few people went recently
09/11/2015, 23:09 - Joe Jarman: I missed out
09/11/2015, 23:22 - Owen: <Media omitted>
09/11/2015, 23:24 - Eliza: Yes yes yes!
09/11/2015, 23:26 - Angela: Yes, love it! But maybe we could think about somewhere a hit closer? It's a 5.5 hour drive to the Lake District from here, without traffic
09/11/2015, 23:30 - Mal: People rave about the cotswolds
09/11/2015, 23:33 - Mal: Minimal peaks
09/11/2015, 23:34 - Mal: Keep me posted though, like a good ramble
09/11/2015, 23:34 - Angela: Or Brecon Beacons?
09/11/2015, 23:35 - Angela: I'm up for the Lake District too, but it would be a lot of car
09/11/2015, 23:36 - Mal: I know it's a long way but I've never been to the nor Scotland
09/11/2015, 23:36 - Mal: There *
09/11/2015, 23:36 - Mal: Also my cousins stag is in PL in may so probably can't make it in reality haha
09/11/2015, 23:47 - Shaggy: Yeah sounds awesome
10/11/2015, 09:12 - Cate: Me! I want to!!
10/11/2015, 11:12 - Lorna: Yes please! Though it is faaaar. We could always get a train and hire a car when we're there
10/11/2015, 11:15 - Mal: Yeah haha
10/11/2015, 11:15 - Mal: Looooong
10/11/2015, 13:16 - AlanWright: Ok. Will see what i can find in brecon beakons and cotswolds
10/11/2015, 13:17 - AlanWright: I guess the nearer it is, the more people will be up for it
10/11/2015, 13:22 - Lorna: The cotswalds is a poor imitation of the peak district
10/11/2015, 13:22 - Mal: Peak District has been ruled out sadly
10/11/2015, 13:26 - Lorna: Yeah, but my point's still valid. Beacons would be a great choice, as would lakes
10/11/2015, 13:26 - Sam Roberts: So I thought 6 hours by car was a lot, but then we did it and it was amazing
10/11/2015, 13:26 - Sam Roberts: Think it massively added to the experience tbh, both got the titillation and for the isolation
10/11/2015, 13:27 - Mal: Yeah
10/11/2015, 13:27 - Mal: Got to love long journeys
10/11/2015, 13:29 - Mike SJ: Peak district is pretty massive
10/11/2015, 13:30 - Mike SJ: I've been >30 times, don't think I've seen all of it
10/11/2015, 13:30 - Mal: It's peak blud
10/11/2015, 13:32 - Mal: How about the pennines
10/11/2015, 13:33 - Mal: That's Yorkshire dales and moors rifht
10/11/2015, 13:38 - Hannah Murphy: Alan the second your bday is over and you're making plans for may 2k16 haha
10/11/2015, 14:20 - AlanWright: I went to peak district 2 years ago. Kind of want to see somewhere new this time.
10/11/2015, 14:21 - AlanWright: Hannah, i'm actually planning all my holidays for 2016 at the moment :)
10/11/2015, 14:36 - Sam Roberts: How do you know a destination will still exist?
10/11/2015, 14:36 - Sam Roberts: I wouldn't book anything near north Korea, or Switzerland. Just a hunch
10/11/2015, 14:40 - Mal: Or anywhere between Western Sahara and Pakistan inclusive
10/11/2015, 15:17 - Owen: Why Britain. We could go to France.
10/11/2015, 15:17 - Owen: ...?!
10/11/2015, 15:17 - Owen: üá´üá∑üá´üá∑üá´üá∑
10/11/2015, 15:17 - Owen: It would probably take less time.
10/11/2015, 15:28 - Mal: Almost definitely would haha
10/11/2015, 15:32 - Owen: The wine is cheap and the cheese is stinky. I was initially joking, but now I am actually serious.
10/11/2015, 15:34 - Mal: You make very good points
10/11/2015, 15:35 - Mal: I would be up for either
10/11/2015, 15:35 - Mal: Although going to France anyway for the euros in June /July realistically
10/11/2015, 16:08 - Joe Jarman: I'm going to France twice
10/11/2015, 16:08 - Joe Jarman: To shout abuse at germans
10/11/2015, 16:08 - Joe Jarman: And generally behave quite poorly
10/11/2015, 16:09 - Joe Jarman: And watch england lift the cup
10/11/2015, 16:11 - Mal: üá¨üáßüö¢/üöäüá´üá∑‚õ∫‚öΩüóº‚öΩüöá‚öΩüí∏üöîüöëüööüá¨üáß

10/11/2015, 16:43 - Angela: The weather is nice in France too. It's rained every single day that I've ever been to the lakes
10/11/2015, 17:22 - AlanWright: France sounds like so much more effort to organise
10/11/2015, 17:45 - AlanWright: I'll set up a separate whatsapp group for this
10/11/2015, 17:53 - Mal: Sweet
10/11/2015, 20:35 - AlanWright: Ok, separate WhatsApp group set up.  If you haven't had an invite and want one, let me know.  @Mal - did you want in? I added you then removed you, but now i'm not sure if you should be in or not...
10/11/2015, 20:36 - Mal: No please add
10/11/2015, 20:36 - Mal: I will leave if cousins stag is an issue
10/11/2015, 20:36 - Mal: Which it could be
10/11/2015, 20:55 - Sam Roberts: Invite please! Unless it's to Paris, in which case Kriz will chop of my legs
10/11/2015, 21:30 - Mal: Nope
10/11/2015, 21:57 - Krizia: üëäüèº

12/11/2015, 08:15 - Sam Roberts: I've got good news and bad news
12/11/2015, 08:16 - Sam Roberts: I found my bike, which is great, but it means I'm officially an idiot
12/11/2015, 08:16 - Sam Roberts: Thanks to everyone who supported me through this trying time
12/11/2015, 08:25 - Shaggy: Go on then, where was it?
12/11/2015, 08:40 - Sam Roberts: West ham station!
12/11/2015, 08:40 - Sam Roberts: I only found it because I'm really hungover and need to take the Hammersmith line, apparently for the second time ever
12/11/2015, 08:41 - Mal: How long it been the
12/11/2015, 08:44 - Shaggy: A fine example of serendipity
12/11/2015, 08:44 - Shaggy: I wonder how many bikes you see this behaviour is responsible for
12/11/2015, 08:45 - Sam Roberts: About a month
12/11/2015, 08:47 - Sam Roberts: I thought that about money the other day, like I've got a couple of old savings accounts with about ¬£1 in them. I wonder how much money is just sitting around like that
12/11/2015, 08:50 - Mal: 1. 25
12/11/2015, 08:50 - Mal: Would be generous
12/11/2015, 08:55 - Tegan: I remember the condem government planning to make some money by reclaiming all those accounts
12/11/2015, 08:59 - Mal: I had an abbey national one, but they haven't existed for years
12/11/2015, 09:01 - Mal: There is a wasp terrorising the train haha
12/11/2015, 09:01 - Mal: Basically by being a dick
12/11/2015, 09:02 - Sam Roberts: e-savings account, ¬£4.86
12/11/2015, 09:02 - Sam Roberts: Thank you compound interest

13/11/2015, 20:13 - Mal: That sounds like a massive stitch up
13/11/2015, 20:14 - Mal: Courtesy of south West trains
13/11/2015, 20:15 - Owen: Haha, yeah, funny...
13/11/2015, 20:16 - Owen: Fuck trains
13/11/2015, 20:17 - Lorna: <Media omitted>
13/11/2015, 20:20 - Shaggy: üòÇ
13/11/2015, 21:22 - Cate: Hey Eliza where are you? The others are going in are you already there? Xx
13/11/2015, 21:29 - AlanWright: Can you guys look after shaggys bag
13/11/2015, 21:30 - Eliza: I'm walking with Dave and Tegs. Eta 5-10mins. See you outside?
13/11/2015, 21:35 - Eliza: We're here.
13/11/2015, 21:47 - Hannah Murphy: Those at the gig we have set up camp in the middle, a couple of rows in front of the sound fella
13/11/2015, 22:52 - Tegan: I've got a spot in the cloakroom queue
13/11/2015, 22:55 - Tegan: Let me know what is the plan
13/11/2015, 23:02 - Lorna: We're heading to slim jims
13/11/2015, 23:03 - Owen: Narcos is awesome for those of you who also had your train station close and nees something amazing to watch on Netflix.
13/11/2015, 23:05 - Mal: Yeah don't watch the news basically
13/11/2015, 23:05 - Mal: Narcos is wicked, only just started though
13/11/2015, 23:10 - Owen: It feels wrong to say but pablo escobar was a fucking boss.
13/11/2015, 23:11 - Mal: Have you ever read "catching pablo"
13/11/2015, 23:11 - Mal: Killing pablo
13/11/2015, 23:35 - Sam Roberts: This is the problem with all media right?
13/11/2015, 23:36 - Sam Roberts: Somehow it dissociated the judgmental part of humanity from the part that wants to gossip
13/11/2015, 23:36 - Sam Roberts: Form without context
13/11/2015, 23:39 - Owen: You may be right Sam, have you see it though. It hardly paints him in a good light. But early on he ran for government and randomly handed money out to the poor.
13/11/2015, 23:40 - Owen: The guy was cool, he's a great example of the corrupting power of... well... power.
13/11/2015, 23:41 - Henry Franks: it's more a dissociation between morals and competence tho
13/11/2015, 23:42 - Henry Franks: he's clearly a monster but he's portrayed as highly effective at achieving goals
13/11/2015, 23:42 - Henry Franks: and that's admirable even if his goals are horrific
13/11/2015, 23:43 - Sam Roberts: No, he started off as an asshole and he was always an show asshole
13/11/2015, 23:44 - Owen: Incorrect
13/11/2015, 23:44 - Sam Roberts: His opening scene is threatening policemen with their children's lives
13/11/2015, 23:44 - Sam Roberts: But it looks cool
13/11/2015, 23:44 - Mal: Some men are born assholes
13/11/2015, 23:44 - Mal: Others become ass holes
13/11/2015, 23:45 - Owen: He literally got elected into government by a huge landslide because the Colombian people loved him so much.
13/11/2015, 23:45 - Mal: Others have assholery thrust upon them
13/11/2015, 23:46 - Owen: Which one is Cameron Mal?
13/11/2015, 23:47 - Mal: Hard to tell, I didn't know him as a kid
13/11/2015, 23:47 - Mal: But I have my suspicions....
13/11/2015, 23:48 - Owen: He probably started by fucking mice and moved up to pigs later on in his political career.
13/11/2015, 23:48 - Phil: Did he actually duck a pig out was that an onion story?
13/11/2015, 23:48 - Mal: Hahaha
13/11/2015, 23:49 - Mal: He never denied it
13/11/2015, 23:49 - Owen: No it was true, he put his dick in a pig mouth as an Oxbridge prank.
13/11/2015, 23:50 - Owen: I think we all judge him a bit harshly to be fair. Loads of us did stupid shit in uni.
13/11/2015, 23:53 - Owen: But anyway back to Escobar. Sam I think there is a certain amount of media portrayal involved. Escobar killed people to make trafficking cocaine easier, Bush killed people to make the dollar stronger. I think us lot as citizens rather than the powerful people pulling the strings can't comprehend the way those with power see human life.
14/11/2015, 01:55 - Dave: üê§

14/11/2015, 02:29 - Lorna: Cameron also allegedly burnt a ¬£50 note in front of a homeless person as a bullingdon prank
14/11/2015, 02:30 - Lorna: Uni or not, you can't judge him hardly enough for that
14/11/2015, 02:30 - Lorna: üêîüêºüê∏üê∑
14/11/2015, 02:43 - Mike SJ: Lad
14/11/2015, 02:46 - AlanWright: Unilad
14/11/2015, 02:50 - Phil: Isn't it illegal to setteth fire to yon sacred majesty's face?
14/11/2015, 08:23 - Mike SJ: It's illegal to set fire to most people's faces
14/11/2015, 09:26 - Mal: Think that's a myth really Phil sadly
14/11/2015, 10:19 - Mike SJ: That uber thing worked last night, cheers mal
14/11/2015, 10:19 - Mike SJ: Only got ¬£15 off tho
14/11/2015, 10:19 - Mal: No worries
14/11/2015, 10:19 - Mal: I'm ecstatic it worked
14/11/2015, 10:19 - Mal: Oh. Well I'm surprised it worked at all ha ha
14/11/2015, 10:20 - Mal: I don't know how much I got because my whole ride was free
14/11/2015, 11:53 - Bongo: Jesus I wasn't prepared for last night
14/11/2015, 11:54 - Bongo: I lost my headphones
14/11/2015, 11:54 - Hannah Murphy: Ha! The shot king is awake
14/11/2015, 11:55 - Krizia: üëäüèº very nice night! Was great to see you all!!!!üéâüéâüéâ
14/11/2015, 11:55 - Krizia: Thanks hannah!
14/11/2015, 11:58 - Bongo: I blame Sam, who orders Jameson's shots
14/11/2015, 11:58 - Krizia: üéâüéâüéâ
14/11/2015, 11:58 - Bongo: And myself for drinking them
14/11/2015, 11:59 - Krizia: Love jamesons shots!!!
14/11/2015, 11:59 - Bongo: üòµ
14/11/2015, 12:10 - Cate: Bongo i think I have your headphones!!
14/11/2015, 12:10 - Bongo: Seriously? Amazing, I was sure I left them at the bar
14/11/2015, 12:11 - Bongo: The last thing I remember was getting a taxi home at 4am then driving round the block several times for a laugh
14/11/2015, 12:12 - Cate: Was it funny?
14/11/2015, 12:13 - Bongo: Very, I only did it to keep talking to the driver, he had some interesting views on immigration
14/11/2015, 12:14 - Cate: You should bring him to the discussion group
14/11/2015, 12:14 - Bongo: Anyway, gief headphones!
14/11/2015, 12:24 - Dave: Headphones are on the boat. We'll get them to you.
14/11/2015, 12:24 - Dave: Do you remember coming to the boat?
14/11/2015, 12:24 - Bongo: Vaguely
14/11/2015, 12:24 - Bongo: I remember it being very cold
14/11/2015, 12:25 - Dave: Heh - it took all of us to carry you along the towpath without you stumbling in the canal
14/11/2015, 12:26 - Dave: Sorry it was cold. These are the hard times
14/11/2015, 12:26 - Mal: Haha yeah last night was pretty cold right
14/11/2015, 12:27 - Mal: I'm trying to stop all the people from hot countries in my house turning on the heating
14/11/2015, 12:27 - Shaggy: Was the taxi driver an immigrant? They always have views on immigration an that amuses me. As an immigrant
14/11/2015, 12:27 - Shaggy: Why? You monster
14/11/2015, 12:28 - Bongo: He wasn't, but we both agreed buying an island off the coast of Greece was the best option
14/11/2015, 12:29 - Bongo: Are you at Hannah's?
14/11/2015, 12:29 - Bongo: Does this mean I can roam around the house naked?
14/11/2015, 12:51 - Hannah Murphy: Can somebody stop shaggy roaming around my house naked
14/11/2015, 12:51 - Shaggy: If you don't mind the webcams
15/11/2015, 06:25 - Phil: <Media omitted>
15/11/2015, 10:25 - Mal: Haha
15/11/2015, 10:25 - Mal: Have you had it before?
16/11/2015, 07:33 - Phil: Pretty disappointing üòî
16/11/2015, 08:27 - Mal: I know right
16/11/2015, 08:27 - Mal: Is alright, but it's no beef
16/11/2015, 08:27 - Joe Jarman: It's quite easy to overcook
16/11/2015, 08:49 - Mal: Yeah, all you have to do is cook it for too long
16/11/2015, 08:56 - Phil: I think it was not overcooked. It's good but beef n pork are better.
16/11/2015, 08:58 - Mal: Yeah
16/11/2015, 08:58 - Mal: Get some ostrich in man
16/11/2015, 08:59 - Phil: It might also just have been bad meat. It was just from a supermarket.
16/11/2015, 09:30 - Mal: Maybe go into the outback and find your own!
16/11/2015, 09:30 - Mal: Yeah go to a kangaroo farm, source your meat directly
16/11/2015, 09:46 - Joe Jarman: Just go out for a spin, knock one down
16/11/2015, 09:46 - Joe Jarman: Stick it on the bbq
16/11/2015, 09:57 - Mal: Yeah
16/11/2015, 09:57 - Mal: Although in order to have enough force to kill it, it's going to do some serious damage to the verbosity
16/11/2015, 09:57 - Mal: Vehicle
16/11/2015, 09:59 - Mal: But at least while you're roasting next to your smouldering wreck, you'll have something to eat
16/11/2015, 09:59 - Mal: Waiting g for the help that never comes
16/11/2015, 10:14 - Phil: I saw a bunch of wallabees today. Reckon they'd be tender. And easier on the vehicle.
16/11/2015, 10:21 - Mal: Awesome.  Is bunn still there?
16/11/2015, 10:24 - Alex Bunn: I'm in Melbourne
16/11/2015, 10:24 - Alex Bunn: Phil is on the beach atm
16/11/2015, 10:24 - Alex Bunn: I'm joining on weds
16/11/2015, 10:25 - Mal: Oh haga
16/11/2015, 10:28 - Joe Jarman: Sweeeeet
16/11/2015, 10:28 - Joe Jarman: Love melbourne

16/11/2015, 10:34 - Mal: Lots of beards and craft ales?
16/11/2015, 10:35 - Alex Bunn: You betcha
16/11/2015, 10:51 - Joe Jarman: That couldn't exist here!!!
16/11/2015, 10:51 - Joe Jarman: I paid 0 a couple of times
16/11/2015, 10:51 - Joe Jarman: Go to lentils as anything
16/11/2015, 10:51 - Joe Jarman: That place is pretty unique
16/11/2015, 10:51 - Joe Jarman: You get shouted at for asking for moo milk in your latte tho
16/11/2015, 10:51 - Joe Jarman: Pay as you feel restaurant
16/11/2015, 10:56 - Joe Jarman: Soy latte is a step too far
16/11/2015, 11:01 - Alex Bunn: Its pretty great here
16/11/2015, 11:08 - Joe Jarman: I'm pretty jealous
16/11/2015, 11:08 - Joe Jarman: I don't care much for Australia but melbourne is sweeeeet
16/11/2015, 11:38 - Owen: Watch "Cats VS Cucumbers" on YouTube - https://youtu.be/sc0mi0Ei1CQ
16/11/2015, 12:24 - Bongo: Yea old news O
16/11/2015, 12:25 - Bongo: Still don't know why cats are so freaked out by them
16/11/2015, 12:25 - Owen: My old news though.
16/11/2015, 12:25 - Owen: I just wanted to post a compilation of them. I am pretty obsessed with it at the moment. Angela have you tried it on your cat yet?
16/11/2015, 12:28 - Shaggy: In your cat
16/11/2015, 12:34 - Angela: No I forgot! And I've been away since Friday. I'll try and remember tomorrow and video it
16/11/2015, 12:34 - Mal: Haha
16/11/2015, 17:32 - Joe Jarman: Fuck you Monday, I win this round!!
16/11/2015, 17:39 - Sam Roberts: <Media omitted>
16/11/2015, 17:46 - Owen: Monday looks cross and Joe has clearly been working out.
16/11/2015, 18:18 - Joe Jarman: üëçüèª
16/11/2015, 20:11 - Angela: <Media omitted>
16/11/2015, 20:20 - Owen: Maybe it didn't work because that is clearly a courgette!
16/11/2015, 20:21 - Angela: Cats do know their vegetables
16/11/2015, 20:27 - Phil: Maybe it was all video shopped. They actually scared the cats with sobering else.
16/11/2015, 20:27 - Phil: Like dread capsicum
16/11/2015, 20:27 - Dave: Maybe cats are super tasters
16/11/2015, 20:27 - Dave: Like Mike
16/11/2015, 20:45 - Lorna: C town - put a cucumber near mike and see what happens!
16/11/2015, 20:46 - Lorna: Bet he runs away
16/11/2015, 20:46 - Sam Roberts: He didn't mind my cucumber
16/11/2015, 20:47 - Angela: That's because it's more of a courgette
16/11/2015, 20:57 - Bongo: More like a string bean
16/11/2015, 21:03 - Sam Roberts: Water melon
16/11/2015, 21:18 - Owen: You should probably get it checked out then Sam.
16/11/2015, 21:19 - Mal: Weeeey
17/11/2015, 10:47 - Mike SJ: <Media omitted>
18/11/2015, 13:13 - Hannah Murphy: Hi gang, anyone willing to speak to a journalist at the FT about how this generation is likely to be poorer than their parents? Colleague writing a piece, they would want some to chat over the phone ASAP this afternoon. X
18/11/2015, 13:17 - Owen: Don't they want to talk to some specialist or something? Instead of "one of the guys on my wassap horde" üòÑüòÑ
18/11/2015, 13:18 - Joe Jarman: Malcolm step up
18/11/2015, 13:18 - Joe Jarman: It would amuse me if you were quoted in the financial Times
18/11/2015, 13:19 - Mike SJ: Second
18/11/2015, 13:19 - Joe Jarman: I'm sure you'll have a lot to say
18/11/2015, 13:19 - Owen: "some guy on wassap said 'we all be done fucked sir'" - FT
18/11/2015, 13:19 - Joe Jarman: Infact I've read most of your rants on col u chat
18/11/2015, 13:20 - Bongo: Lol please just talk about football in the interview it'll be hilarious
18/11/2015, 13:20 - Bongo: Or only talk about our economy through footbal analogies
18/11/2015, 13:21 - Owen: Problem with Cameron is that he always tries to walk it in.
18/11/2015, 13:21 - Mal: I'm not feeling on top form bit I could answer questions I suppose
18/11/2015, 13:22 - Mal: Haha yeah I'm up for it
18/11/2015, 13:23 - Joe Jarman: Go on hannah sort it out
18/11/2015, 13:23 - Owen: But in al seriousness Hannah, what kind of person is he looking for?
18/11/2015, 13:24 - Owen: I might be able to, both my parents were teachers so I can directly compare with them.
18/11/2015, 13:25 - Joe Jarman: You could buy up half of wales with a teacher's salary
18/11/2015, 13:25 - Joe Jarman: Probably hasn't changed that much
18/11/2015, 13:27 - Owen: Well they taught in London, so a pretty direct comparison. They owned a flat in crystal palace at my age. Jerks!!!
18/11/2015, 13:28 - Joe Jarman: Laaaandaaaan
18/11/2015, 13:29 - Owen: Joe, are you drunk!?
18/11/2015, 13:29 - Owen: Lucky bugger...
18/11/2015, 13:29 - Mal: Pulled a sick day to play fallout 4 I reckon
18/11/2015, 13:31 - Bongo: What's fallout like? Everyone seems to be bumming it
18/11/2015, 13:31 - Mal: Great series, dumbed down for the console brigade
18/11/2015, 13:34 - Joe Jarman: I was planning on being drunk
18/11/2015, 13:34 - Joe Jarman: But the bathroom has flooded again
18/11/2015, 13:34 - Joe Jarman: So I'm dealing with that instead
18/11/2015, 13:34 - Mal: No way
18/11/2015, 13:35 - Mal: Ah man wtd
18/11/2015, 13:35 - Mal: Wtf
18/11/2015, 13:35 - Mal: Is it dripping down the walls
18/11/2015, 13:37 - Joe Jarman: Yeah
18/11/2015, 13:37 - Hannah Murphy: Sorry to disappoint but they already found someone
18/11/2015, 13:37 - Mal: That is disappointing. Not just for me but for my loyal supporters
18/11/2015, 13:37 - Joe Jarman: Their loss
18/11/2015, 13:37 - Mal: Yeah my sound bites are sound
18/11/2015, 13:44 - Owen: "my sound bites are sound" - Mal (2015)
18/11/2015, 15:18 - Joe Jarman: All sound bites are sound
18/11/2015, 15:18 - Joe Jarman: Technically
18/11/2015, 15:40 - Mal: I think they can be written down
18/11/2015, 15:40 - Mal: In this day and agw
19/11/2015, 07:57 - Shaggy: http://news.nationalgeographic.com/2015/11/151117-cats-cucumbers-videos-behavior/
19/11/2015, 08:23 - Mike SJ: "If you do it for laughs it makes me question your humanity."
19/11/2015, 08:23 - Mike SJ: Terrible article
19/11/2015, 08:24 - Shaggy: Yeah I can't believe national geographic posted it
19/11/2015, 08:24 - Phil: That's a pretty lame response. They are hella  predators so I don't think being startled once or twice by a cucumber is going to do any lasting harm.
19/11/2015, 08:25 - Phil: Also it doesn't say why it scares them or am I missing something?
19/11/2015, 08:27 - Mike SJ: Goldman explains that the cucumbers are triggering the cats‚Äô natural startle responses, since they ‚Äúwould not normally see cucumbers on the floor.‚Äù¬†
19/11/2015, 08:27 - Mike SJ: SCIENCE
19/11/2015, 08:28 - Tegan: Lol
19/11/2015, 08:29 - Phil: Must be an expert in catonomy
19/11/2015, 08:31 - Shaggy: From what we've read it's more like catology
19/11/2015, 08:40 - Mal: Felinology
19/11/2015, 08:41 - Mal: Is what it is
19/11/2015, 08:41 - Mike SJ: No, she's the catman ski bi di bi di do bap do
19/11/2015, 08:41 - Phil: Not the gibberish in that article
19/11/2015, 08:41 - Mal: Haha no fair enough
19/11/2015, 08:47 - Owen: Wait so the article just winges at cat videos and then doesn't even bother trying to explain!
19/11/2015, 08:48 - Owen: Also what BS, its no more harmful than if you suddenly realise someone entered the room without you noticing.
19/11/2015, 08:54 - Mal: Yeah fuck em
19/11/2015, 08:54 - Mal: Cats I mean
19/11/2015, 08:54 - Mal: It is a poor article
19/11/2015, 08:54 - Mike SJ: I question your humanity Mal
19/11/2015, 08:55 - Mal: Haha
19/11/2015, 08:55 - Mal: To be fair I love cats. They're like number 2 on the list of awesome breasts
19/11/2015, 08:55 - Mal: Beasts
19/11/2015, 08:58 - Phil: What's number one?
19/11/2015, 08:58 - Phil: For breasts?
19/11/2015, 08:58 - Shaggy: Lol
19/11/2015, 08:58 - Shaggy: Are breasts number one on the list of awesome breasts?
19/11/2015, 08:59 - Phil: Human breasts are def top five
19/11/2015, 09:03 - Mal: Yeah human
19/11/2015, 09:03 - Mal: Or cow
19/11/2015, 09:03 - Mal: I mean great apes are number one in the beast o meter
19/11/2015, 09:03 - Mal: And breasts therefore
19/11/2015, 09:04 - Phil: Chicken breast has sick protein yo. That should count for something damn it.
19/11/2015, 09:05 - Mal: I mean is probably still top 5
19/11/2015, 09:05 - Mal: Is up the. Competitive, if not a true champion
19/11/2015, 09:05 - Mal: Therw
19/11/2015, 09:07 - Mike SJ: Haha
19/11/2015, 15:02 - Bongo: That diesel dog is so cute
19/11/2015, 15:03 - Bongo: <Media omitted>
19/11/2015, 15:46 - Mal: Don't think that's actually him is it
19/11/2015, 15:46 - Mal: ?
19/11/2015, 15:46 - Mal: because he died. This is another dog paying homage
19/11/2015, 15:53 - Mal: Isn't it?
19/11/2015, 17:58 - Bongo: Oh
19/11/2015, 18:23 - Mal: I think
19/11/2015, 18:23 - Mal: Not gospel
19/11/2015, 18:33 - Bongo: #JeSuisDesole
19/11/2015, 18:41 - Mal: I do hope I'm wrong though
19/11/2015, 18:53 - Hannah Murphy: They sent diesel in to check if anyone was still alive after the police raided that terrorist holdout.
19/11/2015, 18:53 - Hannah Murphy: Turns out someone was alive and they shot diesel :(
19/11/2015, 18:54 - Angela: How does a dog check that? Do they ask him when he comes out?
19/11/2015, 18:55 - Hannah Murphy: Probably some barking shit
19/11/2015, 18:55 - Mal: Well you'd at least hear the sound of the guy shooting the dog
19/11/2015, 18:56 - Lorna: üòÉ...üò¢
19/11/2015, 18:56 - Mal: Yeah basically
19/11/2015, 18:56 - Mal: But I still think that dog in the picture is an alternative dog
19/11/2015, 19:07 - Shaggy: If you're colour blind, how do you know if you're seeing it all gray and not all pink, for example?
19/11/2015, 19:33 - Mike SJ: Dogs can't see red, but they can see the other colours
19/11/2015, 19:33 - Mike SJ: #dogfacts
19/11/2015, 22:34 - Bongo: When a dog sniffs another dogs butt it's actually opening an invisible portal to another dimension
19/11/2015, 22:34 - Bongo: #dogfacts
19/11/2015, 22:50 - Dave: All horrible stench ridden dimensions
19/11/2015, 22:52 - Mike SJ: Dog spelled backwards, is the word god
19/11/2015, 22:52 - Mike SJ: #dogfacts

20/11/2015, 10:06 - Mike SJ: He's not skipping leg day
20/11/2015, 11:00 - Jimena: So if they can't see red, what do they see when there is something red?
20/11/2015, 11:04 - Owen: What do I see when something is red?
20/11/2015, 11:04 - Jimena: <Media omitted>
20/11/2015, 11:05 - Owen: If you can answer that you can answer the dog question.
20/11/2015, 11:05 - Jimena: *prays this doesn't turn into metaphysics*
20/11/2015, 11:07 - Owen: The physics answer is that I assume they have green and blue cones then if they are only red color blind, so they would probably see red as a slightly different shade of green.
20/11/2015, 11:07 - Mike SJ: Yeah if this goes into philosophy chat I'll see red
20/11/2015, 11:10 - Owen: I looked it up, dogs have  blue and yellow cones.
20/11/2015, 11:10 - Owen: So red would look yellow to them.
20/11/2015, 11:10 - Jimena: <Media omitted>
20/11/2015, 11:12 - Owen: Hmmm, interestingly, humans don't actually have red cones, they have blue, blue-green and yellow-green cones.
20/11/2015, 11:12 - Jimena: I found my answer üòÅ
20/11/2015, 11:12 - Jimena: <Media omitted>
20/11/2015, 11:13 - Owen: Yeah, that's what I said.
20/11/2015, 11:13 - Jimena: They see red as brown
20/11/2015, 11:13 - Jimena: Aaah i didnt see that

20/11/2015, 18:40 - Tegan: It's really a big world,  isn't it
20/11/2015, 18:42 - Bongo: I'm actually impressed fb has that level of profanity screening
20/11/2015, 19:02 - Shaggy: Those prejudiced phucs

20/11/2015, 19:30 - Owen: Is anyone with Eliza, can you ask her if I need to pick up dinner, I don't think she can hear her phone.

21/11/2015, 20:47 - Shaggy: Oh well if you found it on the internet, it must be true
21/11/2015, 20:48 - Owen: I was so close to coming, I saw Dan all the way to the train, at that point I decided to go home, because home is 10 minutes away, and seven sisters is an hour and a half away.
21/11/2015, 20:49 - Cat: Fair enough. Very last minute
21/11/2015, 20:50 - Owen: I was also dressed as that guy that accidentally walks into frame in normal street clothes, which breaks the fourth wall and pulls you completely out of proceedings.
21/11/2015, 23:32 - Tegan: How about the bar in the shard for a cocktail? Feels sufficiently classy for a birthday
21/11/2015, 23:32 - Tegan: Also, it needs an occasion for us to go up there

24/11/2015, 00:56 - Phil: I think it's taken from 4chan which was always super racist
24/11/2015, 00:56 - Phil: What I meant is I got it from Facebook
24/11/2015, 00:58 - Phil: Vanilla Isis is brilliant though.

24/11/2015, 09:37 - Sam Roberts: And you should be, that's some internet racist levels of humour
24/11/2015, 09:40 - Owen: Sharia Twain isn't racist.

16/12/2015, 18:33 - Owen: Sutton sucks. They cancel about 50% of my trains.
16/12/2015, 18:33 - Owen: So I'll be there about 7:40 instead.

17/12/2015, 01:40 - Cat: Are you still out on the lash!?
17/12/2015, 01:57 - Dave: Nah...stumbling home!
17/12/2015, 08:12 - Owen: Gah, so hungover. And I have to interact with children today.
17/12/2015, 08:12 - Owen: Instead of being Owen Owen couldn't I be Clive Owen from children of men?
17/12/2015, 08:19 - Sam Roberts: Omg I hurt so much
17/12/2015, 08:20 - Sam Roberts: Also uber car share, never again
17/12/2015, 08:20 - Owen: http://i.imgur.com/j7VAqi5.gifv
17/12/2015, 08:20 - Sam Roberts: Took me an hour and I ended up at shaggy's place instead of c town
17/12/2015, 08:20 - Phil: Where did you uber to?
17/12/2015, 08:21 - Sam Roberts: Well, I asked for c town, but bailed when we were still heading south
17/12/2015, 08:21 - Joe Jarman: But you saved 25%!!!
17/12/2015, 08:21 - Sam Roberts: I think they match me with someone going to Dover
17/12/2015, 08:21 - Sam Roberts: Haha yeah, it was hella cheap!
17/12/2015, 08:22 - Mike SJ: I bet you said Croydon rd and he thought you mean Croydon
17/12/2015, 08:22 - Owen: Who were you going to shaggy's with?
17/12/2015, 08:30 - Sam Roberts: Some nerd in a suit
17/12/2015, 08:30 - Sam Roberts: I didn't say anything to either of them
17/12/2015, 08:31 - Tegan: Sorry for buying the last pint we all didn't need
17/12/2015, 08:31 - Mal: You want good, don't get uber haha. Although I liked our guy last night
17/12/2015, 08:31 - Sam Roberts: They've almost eliminated every human element of the taxi experience. I think I'm turning into an uber denier
17/12/2015, 08:31 - Sam Roberts: Haha yes Teeg! You even called it at the time!
17/12/2015, 08:34 - Owen: Some nerd stayed at shaggy's?
17/12/2015, 08:35 - Sam Roberts: Ok, so they do this thing now where you can get an uber sharer, or uber pool or whatever they call it
17/12/2015, 08:36 - Phil: Yo nerds. When are we seeing Star Wars and who has a thousand wigs I can staple together for a Chewbacca costume?
17/12/2015, 08:36 - Sam Roberts: So you get in and go one street, then some random dude gets in and you both get taken home on the cheap
17/12/2015, 08:37 - Sam Roberts: Yeah man, Monday? I'm wfh now
17/12/2015, 08:38 - Owen: But why shaggy's?
17/12/2015, 08:38 - Dan Sluckin: But why male models?
17/12/2015, 08:38 - Owen: Haha
17/12/2015, 08:38 - Sam Roberts: That's where they took me, because of the sharer algorithm
17/12/2015, 08:39 - Owen: Presumably you tell the taxi where to go though. Since when do taxis decide your destination?
17/12/2015, 08:39 - Owen: Uber is weird.
17/12/2015, 08:40 - Shaggy: In communist Russia
17/12/2015, 08:40 - Owen: They have an algorithm to decide where you want to go independent of whether you actually want to go there or not?
17/12/2015, 08:41 - Mal: Haha yeah I wondered that!
17/12/2015, 08:41 - Mal: To be fair for 25 percent only,  I'm not turned into the idea
17/12/2015, 08:41 - Mal: If everyone is only saving 25 percent, they're making fat stax ?!
17/12/2015, 08:44 - Mal: 2 fares at 75 percent actually equals 150 percent of what they'd actually get for a solo riddim rider
17/12/2015, 08:44 - Sam Roberts: Not sure if joking, or our aggregate hangover has reached brain damage levels
17/12/2015, 08:54 - Phil: Sam got out before he reached his destination because he felt the trip was taking too long. Either because the uber share algorithm matched him poorly, with someone who's destination was out of the way or because he was drunk and needed a leak more than a ride home.
17/12/2015, 08:55 - Mike SJ: I mean, it can't help your passenger rating if you piss yourself in the car
17/12/2015, 08:56 - Phil: Would probably bring yours up Mike
17/12/2015, 08:57 - Mike SJ: Haha
17/12/2015, 08:57 - Mike SJ: Nah uber love me, had my 100th trip the other day
17/12/2015, 08:58 - Shaggy: Waaaaht
17/12/2015, 08:58 - Mike SJ: I know right
17/12/2015, 08:58 - Mal: No
17/12/2015, 08:59 - Mal: Did they give you it for free?
17/12/2015, 08:59 - Mike SJ: Sadly no
17/12/2015, 09:00 - Mike SJ: I don't think it's worth giving discounts to people who are already hooked
17/12/2015, 09:02 - Mal: üí∏
17/12/2015, 09:02 - Sam Roberts: Right on both counts Phil, excellent summary
17/12/2015, 09:03 - Tegan: I love people who give me things for free even when they don't have to
17/12/2015, 09:03 - Tegan: It gives me a sense of enormous wellbeing
17/12/2015, 09:04 - Sam Roberts: Now we're so far into the topic, big love for shaggy n Bongo for letting me in!
17/12/2015, 09:05 - Phil: You should try streaming teegs. Same principle.
17/12/2015, 09:05 - Phil: Stealing
17/12/2015, 09:06 - Mal: Haha
17/12/2015, 09:06 - Mal: Did you stay over I assume?
17/12/2015, 09:36 - Sam Roberts: Nah, I just made them open the door
17/12/2015, 09:38 - Mal: Then legged it?
17/12/2015, 09:58 - Dave: I feel like death today
17/12/2015, 09:58 - Dave: I think I'm still drunk l
17/12/2015, 09:59 - Dave: But not in a good way
17/12/2015, 10:01 - Alex Bunn: Your last message was at 2am!
17/12/2015, 10:02 - Owen: Are you in work?
17/12/2015, 10:03 - Dave: Ergh...two parties on a Wednesday does not bode well for Thursday
17/12/2015, 10:03 - Dave: I'm on a bus full of singing children
17/12/2015, 10:04 - Owen: I'm teaching a class of singing children. So suck it Dave!
17/12/2015, 10:05 - Dave: Dang...that's tough.

17/12/2015, 11:20 - Mike SJ: Space is physics right?
17/12/2015, 11:21 - Alex Bunn: The whole point of going during the day is to avoid kids?
17/12/2015, 11:21 - Mike SJ: Good point

24/12/2015, 12:48 - Owen: Mine remembers all the stupid shit I spell wrong when I'm drunk and then slips it into sober conversation.
24/12/2015, 13:19 - Mal: No idea what I meant guys sorry
24/12/2015, 13:22 - Sam Roberts: "Hugging balls" most sensible I could make

24/12/2015, 13:57 - Mal: If I did that I wouldn't have a mug depicting some of my greatest fails
24/12/2015, 14:03 - Mike SJ: You can't check anything if you don't mean to send

24/12/2015, 14:05 - Owen: Mike should get a mug of all the times he's been premature.
24/12/2015, 14:05 - Mal: I was thinking that

01/01/2016, 22:43 - AlanWright: Today is the day for organising things it seems... on Friday 5th February there are two awesome looking events. Renegade Hardware at the Coronet which is ¬£30.  Rumpus (very similar to the old discontinued ALAN nights but with more fancy dress and less underage people) is also happening on the same night.  Will probably be ¬£15 or ¬£20 a ticket.  I've emailed Rumpus to find out where the venue is - if it's Islington Metal Works it sounds like a good bet.
01/01/2016, 22:43 - AlanWright: So, is anyone up for going to one or either of these events?
01/01/2016, 22:55 - Tegan: I'd be up for another rumpus
01/01/2016, 22:55 - Tegan: But I'm out for that one sadly
01/01/2016, 23:05 - AlanWright: Have you been to Rumpus before?
01/01/2016, 23:05 - AlanWright: I've actually never been.  It didn't exist before I left for Vietnam
01/01/2016, 23:08 - Joe Jarman: I'm impressed by your motivation alan
01/01/2016, 23:09 - Joe Jarman: What sort of music is rumpus
01/01/2016, 23:09 - Joe Jarman: Bit like carousel?
01/01/2016, 23:14 - AlanWright: More carnival than Carousel
01/01/2016, 23:15 - AlanWright: http://rumpusparty.co.uk/videos/
01/01/2016, 23:15 - AlanWright: There's usually lots of rooms though. So a big variety of stuff
01/01/2016, 23:17 - Joe Jarman: Like regression sessions? üòù
01/01/2016, 23:18 - Joe Jarman: I'm not sure people can handle the renegade hardware
01/01/2016, 23:18 - Joe Jarman: Definitely not with yellow üçì
01/01/2016, 23:19 - Joe Jarman: Too cuddly
01/01/2016, 23:20 - AlanWright: I think it'll be better then regression sessions.  Certainly we'll feel less like we're too old to be there.  Here are photos from the last event.  Everyone looks kind of our age... https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.961315087269366.1073741860.151698098231073&type=3
01/01/2016, 23:21 - Joe Jarman: Will they play mr happy
01/01/2016, 23:22 - AlanWright: But yeah, Rumpus is more for the festival feel and carnival atmosphere than music we're guaranteed to all really like.  Musically, Renegade Hardware will be the better night IMO
01/01/2016, 23:24 - Tegan: Friends of mine have been and really enjoyed it
01/01/2016, 23:24 - Tegan: Fancy dress is totally obligatory though
01/01/2016, 23:38 - Angela: Mr happy! I haven't heard that song in years
02/01/2016, 00:19 - Joe Jarman: üòäüòäüòäüòäüòä
02/01/2016, 09:44 - Mal: How can renegade hardware keep doing these final ever renegade hardwares

02/01/2016, 14:12 - Tegan: Given how it's a Saturday and all
