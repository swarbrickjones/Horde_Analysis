with cava heading to chipotle.i don't remember anything after the th bottle of wine.ooh yay my shirt.what debate is this.my fruit bowl made my nectarine sad or happy.he's dead now.yeah poor little guy didn't stand a chance far too tasty looking.technically he was killed by his oxygen tank exploding set off by the eecigarette.so you're probably ok unless you're carting one of those around in which case you're not that ok to begin with.i'm guessing he had some kind of smoking related illness how ironic.it'd be bad for whoever finds you vaporised by poo.tom means lesbian in thai specifically it means dyke any toms here ben means stupid in chinese too.exactly how it sounds tasty dyke broth thai has a letter in between d and t which is used for tom yum soup so it's a bit different.have you

join you.maybe he's just passing on his greatest legacy the name of an amazing piece of kitchenware being called george forman must open a lot of doors in life.what happened and what is that crazy spirit.rocking a burberry hat too years ahead of the curve.i think it'll be a no what do you think.i didn't think i was bothered but actually i would be a bit sad if they voted yes like being dumped by someone i completely took for granted all these years.i agree i think at least for no.while they weight the results for sampling they can't weight them for people lying all the polls in predicted a labour win but it turned out that voting conservative was so uncool that people just didn't want to admit to it.probably voting no is seen as boring but actually people do want the safer option.happy birthday teegs it was nearly scotland's birthday too.haha that looks kind of menacing.so if i wear jeans no cancer.wait jean skirts though no jean skirts.itsu used to have some really nice veggie potsu but they have got rid of them and replaced them with chicken and duck i was mighty disappointed and now all their veggie food sucks apart from selected stores lucky bastards best veggie sushi is crushh crussh it all looks wrong.i don't even know how to express how that comment made me feel a cross between amusement and horror.hi horde does anyone know anyone who is between houses or something who might wanna stay at my house and look after my cat for a week when i'm on holiday it's the st week of november.oh really cool.awesome that sounds perfect the cat is slightly high maintenance the one time we ever left her alone overnight she brought a revenge pigeon into the house her only ever kill so as long as you can be in the house at least at some point overnight she should be fine i live in streatham btw if that's ok for you.i have actually thought about it you can buy these cat training litter boxes that fit in the toilet i think it's too late now though she prefers the great outdoors.no she gets too confused by that one when i try she stands up on her hind legs i will try again though.sam would you mind bringing my shirt to the globe tomorrow i've lost all my hipster credentials without my plaid.thank you.perky.this is my favourite ever headline or was until i saw that one.loud noises.i actually have one of those vegetable sharpener peelers one of the random xmas presents my sister always gives me yet to try putting the peelings on my face.what £ a day that's nuts.are you still gonna be at london bridge when you stay at mine mins on the train and £ for the week d.what's going on with that burger why is bread in the middle.haha you'd need something like a hockey goalie to save you i think.i'm up for something after work if it's early working tomorrow so early tomorrow.heading to the george with sam soon.just saw birdman it's a groovy film and not at all what i expected tell me when you've seen it it's the kind of movie to discuss over a pint.me and jason are on our way prob be mins.will be a bit longer now had to abandon initial journey plan when it turned our that a train from st pancras to stratford was £.at highbury and islington now.haha please find a way to write about that in your exam.there's a theory that says when you learn another language you hear a word regularly without taking it in it for ages and then one day when your ability gets good enough you suddenly 'notice' it and either understand it through context or you look it up or whatever then after that you notice it every time it's said because you know it's there which is spooky if it's also true in english cos it means you're just deaf to this word for years but it's actually been there all along.it's the rd most popular phrase in the horde didn't you see mike's analysis.why did it make you angry teegs.getting old to the point where that becomes apparent is rubbish no longer do i have potential i had so much potential.my cat just got so confused about the snow tried to jump on a chair and skidded off then was digging around.streatham snow.did someone say pancakes.i did just looking at trains from mine now is there free parking near yours feeling lazy and what can i bring.all my trains to elephant are cancelled what treachery is this.cool thanks trains are all cancelled til and then it says bulletin on the service whatever that means.woohoo i'll be there in about then with lemons.what was that thing called that we were watching last night with the animals and the lovin' and the carpet pigeon.loads of people in my office were eating those for lunch even though it took them mins on the bus to get there.burn.wow god is really micromanaging these days.i will not sure i can keep up with you though teegs when are you reading it by.alan partridge should be the new presenter.hammond isn't a hamster he's a sheep with his head far up clarksons arse.i'm not sure my work would employ a pirate over an alcoholic they encourage drinking on occasion but never plundering..sounds about right ba politics and ketamine.is the paperclip club some kind of biker gang.i think that's a formal letter of complaint..i would feel like i had to vote labour without it which i'm not particularly keen to do and would only do cos my mp is good voting for ed miliband though euch.he may be sincere but he has no ideas of his own.his main policy is slightly less austerity than the conservatives.but cats though when will this country see a sensible policy on bus passes for cats.but buying a house isn't the same as having a personal deficit because the money grows.and you can borrow against the rising value to gain more money for investment this isn't the same as just getting into more debt you technically owe more money but your assets are worth more.i don't know whether the value of whatever the gov is investing in will also grow though.yeah definitely i mean they sold the eurostar which is majorly in profit.for like deficit reduction.it's all clearly ideological.that's so true labour have completely fallen into line with the tory 'divide and conquer' mentality of blaming everything bad that happens on people slightly poorer and therefore lazier than you which i think is a major contributor to the success of ukip.haha waxwork snake.has anybody checked whether the cameron waxwork is missing.it actually does look more like a human.as i heard someone say on the radio tory policies are like deciding not to feed your kids because you want to pay off the mortgage faster.i would accept big companies being made to pay their tax.i think a lot of that is scaremongering when the minimum wage was introduced the main argument against it was that companies would all react by firing a load of employees but that didn't happen if here's the political will then companies tend to fall into line.the will just doesn't exist.but they still sell goods in this country and avoid paying tax on those by not being registered here there's a loophole to be closed.they won't want to stop selling goods here i'm talking about amazon though not startups it's about making companies pay the tax that is due not raising all business tax.i've also heard that it would be more than the deficit.maybe if it's backdated.the conservative party really do.though actually neither party is protecting the education budget in their manifesto.yeah they have protected it either against inflation or per pupil but no party has committed to both so if pupil numbers rise or there's inflation it could still potentially decline in real terms.ukip should really be focusing on scotland.bloody parasites.is 'hot asian' a different race.ducks on saville row.it was me no i haven't seen that.it's a nice idea to include more parties i wonder how many people use it..i don't think you need it.eerily quiet at my polling station i was the only one in there for a while awkwardvoting should i stay here for a while read the whole list to make it seem like i'm thinking about it.it's lose lose for me really can i get a veg now.what happened.that's so weird why wouldn't they.and yet you don't have to show id when you go and vote.people joined voteswap thats pretty cool.as soon as he stops sobbing long enough to appear on camera probably..mine might we have post th form interns what do they want to do.i think if they came here they'd probably be set some work to do rather than shadowing someone.but they would see professional people.aw man not gonna be around how do you get tickets.yeah how random was that and now here's thought for the day.we could ponder over the seconds menu and then decide we'd better not.ooh seconds in a doggy bag would be great.would avoid that problem of already having eaten all the best bits.maybe some people give it to the dog.maybe there could be doggy bagging rights at restaurants if you see a plate of unfinished food from another table you should be able to claim it.let's start a campaign.campaign for doggy bagging.you should carry around some tupperware once it's in your tupperware all cooties disappear and that's science.just because i've bought food doesn't stop me wanting to eat everyone else's food.lol diseases.i'm not sure lizards would attack putin he is one of them..www kissmyass com.i went to see it today it's extremely silly but quite enjoyable.some mega cheesy scenes yup some real fictional science a wobbly dna character keeps jeeps it has it all.nobody gives a shit about archeologists any more though that's old hat it's all about snazzy geneticists.i can't confirm or deny those rumours it might spoil the incredible suspense and uncertainty about the outcome.mind blown.there needs to be a tumbleweed emoji.anyone in london bridge area station shut and all buses full hanging out for a while i guess.made it onto a bus in the end so hot might be a fire on the bus too.the conference i was at today had broken air con and massive windows why does no air con work in this country it's like every year on the hottest day everyone remembers that it didn't work last year either but they've forgotten to get it fixed.swimming with a coot nice where is that surely not hampstead heath when it's so empty.wow whenever i've been there it's been super busy looks awesome jealous bet those old guys live down the road and bought their houses for £.is that in april the water festival.waterloo.clapham.ha suck it bunn..ha nice.i've spent way too long staring at a tube map trying to figure out that clock bus now.does overground count i must have read all the name by now.maybe the canadian flag represents the sound 'ay' cos of how canadians love to say ay.yeah that's it i've got nothing clockbusay station.the bus to canada.go on.haha nice good research i thought maybe barbican as in buscan dunno where the clock fits in.i love serial.after it finished i missed it so much.there's meant to be a season.who's carl again.oooh yeah jay is so shady.did you see that jay did an interview after the podcast came out..classy joint.☝ ️.the one day when it sucks being a cyclist no excuses.yup same then i remembered that i would be having a very boring and quiet day at work.hey horde does anyone happen to have a tent i could borrow for a week in september the kind you can stand up in rather than the kind that's just a roof for a bed.wow how big is the man when it's packed away i do have a car.i have no idea how big that is but it looks like it would fit in a car is it a one with sleeping pods or one big room.haha do you have a pic of it when it's up would it be massively antisocial on a small campsite maybe it would be awesome and everyone would be jealous of me.maybe emojis are lego or simpsons but black simpsons still have dark skin.that's awesome.nice.hey alan not around this weekend unfortunately but hope to see you soon.hate to break it to you but summer ended in july this year.where's the fud is it in notting hill too i love injera dave i walked past the eritrean restaurant in clapham junction last week where you accidentally went on my birthday last year good times for the rest of us.could well be.what's the film festival about themed.sounds good i'm in.i like funny.ha that's awesome.probably as many terrorists as party clowns.dave and tegan what time are you around later.can prob be there around then have got some work stuff i need to get done though so might be late.wo.yeah corbin.what are you doing to that poor chicken.tegan i'm at a wedding this saturday so i can't make it maybe they'll have eggs and i can celebrate remotely.but eggs though i'd love an egg
