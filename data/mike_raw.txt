4 Aug 11:36 - Shaggy: One of the chilies turned red over the weekend
4 Aug 11:41 - Hannah Murphy: Yay! Go red!
4 Aug 11:42 - Dave: Whoop!
4 Aug 11:58 - Sam Roberts: That means it's done
4 Aug 12:23 - Alex Bunn: Eat it
4 Aug 12:24 - Alex Bunn: Good Saturday Shaggy drinks everyone x
4 Aug 12:37 - Phil: Eat it before it turns the neighbouring plants red. Domino effect is a Bitch.
4 Aug 20:20 - Alex Bunn: <Media omitted>
5 Aug 20:46 - Sam Roberts: Anyone watching the debate? I need to educate myself!
5 Aug 20:51 - Tegan: Can you record it? Does that still happen?
5 Aug 20:51 - Angela: What debate is this?
5 Aug 20:52 - Tegan: Or could iplayer it later in the week?  Would be happy to join you to yaahboo at Alex Salmond
5 Aug 20:52 - Dave: The summary is that salmond will say lots of optimistic things and darling will say lots of pessimistic things (despite his name).
5 Aug 20:52 - Dave: It will be unclear who is right
5 Aug 20:53 - Dave: End result will depend on whether you are optimistic or not
6 Aug 12:35 - Sam Roberts: Good debate, felt a lot more like opinions backed by facts, and less like rabble rousing rhetoric than I was expecting
6 Aug 12:35 - Sam Roberts: Just saw this a week, guess who made their own outfit from a bin bag
6 Aug 12:35 - Sam Roberts: <Media omitted>
6 Aug 12:54 - Phil: Is it that bearded chick in the middle?
6 Aug 12:57 - Martha: Awesome picture!

6 Aug 13:07 - Krizia: Building up a beautiful image around thanks ;)
6 Aug 13:11 - Alex Bunn: So shiny
6 Aug 13:20 - Sam Roberts: Makes me laugh every time. It actually looked really good, just all the flash photography
7 Aug 16:57 - Owen: Wassappening this evening erybody?
7 Aug 17:08 - Phil: Silver 1 you noob slacker
7 Aug 17:46 - Owen: Yeah lets do the impossible! !!

8 Aug 10:22 - Shaggy: Óêí that's so awesome
8 Aug 10:24 - Alex Bunn: Lol
8 Aug 10:42 - Tegan: Yaaaay!
8 Aug 10:43 - Angela: He's dead now.
8 Aug 10:48 - Shaggy: Because you ate him?
8 Aug 11:00 - Angela: Yeah, poor little guy didn't stand a chance
8 Aug 11:01 - Angela: Far too tasty looking
8 Aug 11:19 - Alex Bunn: Thats what gets for being sad/happy on a friday
8 Aug 11:33 - Krizia: Hahahaha happyyy üéäüéäÓåíÓåí Friday!!!
8 Aug 11:33 - Krizia: I don't want to get eaten ;)
8 Aug 14:45 - Shaggy: Someone died from e cigarette exploding, they are bound to make them illegal now
8 Aug 14:46 - Henry Dranks: laaame I love my ecig
8 Aug 14:46 - Tegan: A few people have set on fire already
8 Aug 14:47 - Tegan: I imagine it will be hard to stop people ordering them from China,  which is where they all seem to come from anyway
8 Aug 14:47 - Henry Dranks: tbh mine gets really sodding hot im not surprised theyre combusting
8 Aug 14:48 - Angela: Technically he was killed by his oxygen tank exploding
8 Aug 14:48 - Angela: Set off by the eecigarette
8 Aug 14:48 - Tegan: Was he under water?
8 Aug 14:48 - Angela: So you're probably ok unless you're carting one of those around, in which case you're not that ok to begin with
8 Aug 14:48 - Shaggy: That's circumstantial, e cigarettes are the real #terrorists here
8 Aug 14:49 - Angela: I'm guessing he had some kind of smoking related illness - how ironic
8 Aug 14:50 - Shaggy: To have lung cancer and die from explosion?
8 Aug 14:50 - Shaggy: At least he can laugh in the face of cancer
8 Aug 14:51 - Henry Dranks: id rather die explosively than cancerously tbh
8 Aug 14:51 - Shaggy: That's ambiguous. Explosive diarrhoea is not a nice way to go
8 Aug 14:53 - Henry Dranks: depends just how explosive surely. I mean, if your digestive system straight up vaporises you it wouldnt be too bad
8 Aug 14:53 - Angela: It'd be bad for whoever finds you
8 Aug 14:54 - Angela: Vaporised by poo
8 Aug 15:16 - Tegan: Ye gods
8 Aug 15:16 - Tegan: Is it possible?
8 Aug 15:46 - Shaggy: Yup, lookup pooverization
8 Aug 15:47 - Shaggy: In fact this is where the word poverty is desired from, literally meaning bathing in own shit
8 Aug 15:49 - Henry Dranks: haha pooverisation love it
8 Aug 15:49 - Henry Dranks: not to be confused with hooverisation, wherein the victim is slowly pulled inside a dyson
8 Aug 15:55 - Shaggy: If anyone is interested in etymology, the term was invented by dyson on Hoover dam, and has nothing to do with hoovers, which are not powerful enough for that particular form of homicide
8 Aug 15:55 - Tegan: Or shoeverisation, where the victim is beaten to death with his own shoes...
8 Aug 15:55 - Tegan: Good Fridaying, everyone x
8 Aug 16:03 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: Lol
8 Aug 16:03 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: Poo
8 Aug 16:03 - Alex Bunn: I just misprinted 80 sheets of paper

19 Aug 18:03 - Lorna: Two mathematicians I know: dong Wang and jumbo wang
19 Aug 18:05 - Lorna: There should be a support group for people whose names mean penis
19 Aug 18:07 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: You can't not succeed in life with a name like Jumbo Wang
19 Aug 18:09 - Hannah Murphy: A lot of pressure on you in the bedroom I would expect
19 Aug 18:09 - Hannah Murphy: Stressful
19 Aug 18:09 - Sam Roberts: It's a big name to live up to

19 Aug 19:06 - Angela: Exactly how it sounds, tasty dyke broth
19 Aug 19:08 - Angela: Thai has a letter in between d and t, which is used for tom yum soup. So it's a bit different
19 Aug 19:32 - Owen: I teach a kid called dong hung. I bet he doesn't get picked on because he can always use the "dong hung by name dong hung by nature" comeback.
19 Aug 22:15 - Bongo: Lol I remember xxx! We cracked up so much when we saw it, think we were massively high or something

29 Aug 15:08 - Angela: I felt far more Friday yesterday when I'd given up on productivity. Today I'm mainly panicking as a result of that.
29 Aug 15:08 - Tegan: I am not going to achieve any more today. ..
29 Aug 15:09 - Tegan: I may take myself to the pub

29 Aug 18:31 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: It was only 4 days lol
29 Aug 18:32 - Bongo: I know!!!
29 Aug 18:34 - Bongo: I feel like I've grown up, had kids, retired and I'm sitting on a park bench slowly dying in husk of a body

30 Aug 11:18 - Angela: How about a gravestone with a tempting yet destructive clue: here lies Angela Clark, I buried the treasure under the house
30 Aug 11:22 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: Lol. I think I might randomly slag off Owen for no reason. "He knows what he did"
30 Aug 11:29 - Owen: Mine will read. "Here lies Mike Swarbrick. They replaced me with a robot do not trust the replacement"

30 Aug 16:22 - Tegan: But then,  it probably depends on the man and the day
30 Aug 16:22 - Vanessa: The front bar is better than the back bar
30 Aug 16:23 - Tegan: I'm game

1 Sep 18:44 - Lorna: Yo horde, does anyone have any awesome restaurant suggestions around London bridge? In the 'parents are paying but don't want to look like I'm taking advantage' price bracket?
1 Sep 18:49 - Shaggy: If you like turkish cuisine I strongly recommend tas, it's pretty cheap and mighty tasty. If you want tapas then brindisa is really good, it's moderately priced. If you want a more pub-like atmosphere the George has excellent chefs too
1 Sep 19:41 - Lora: Brindisa is expensive and always too crowded, long wait. I always love me a good vapiano!
1 Sep 22:58 - Bongo: I thought you said it was Friday henners, or is that something else
1 Sep 22:58 - Henry Dranks: I did, I was wrong

5 Sep 20:20 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: Racist
5 Sep 20:39 - Dan Sluckin: That's what SHE said.
5 Sep 20:40 - Owen: I believe bongo was relaying the information that a fine gangsta named shorty is able to fire a shot gun proficiently but only if he is in less affluent neighbourhoods.
5 Sep 20:41 - Dan Sluckin: (After the 'incident')
5 Sep 20:50 - Tegan: Thank you Owen

5 Sep 20:56 - Shaggy: Now this is a rhyme I haven't heard
5 Sep 20:57 - Krizia: <Media omitted>
5 Sep 21:25 - Owen: I am a slow loris
I live in a forest
Eating bugs makes my day
Detroit what'd ya say?
5 Sep 21:26 - Owen: I pull out my gat
And with a ratatat tat
Five slugs in your belly
Makes tupac jelly.
5 Sep 21:30 - Owen: When I left compton town
The crime rate went down
Like sam's mom on peter kay
Thats g life; O-K?
5 Sep 21:30 - Shaggy: Not bad
5 Sep 21:31 - Shaggy: For a five year old dive dwelling chive favouring slum child
5 Sep 21:32 - Tegan: Lol
5 Sep 21:32 - Tegan: Chive favouring
5 Sep 21:32 - Tegan: Nice rhymes, o
5 Sep 21:33 - Tegan: Where did V go?
5 Sep 21:37 - Owen: Let's have a word for Mike swarbrick.
He wears the badge of a law dick.
Takes names: 'your nicked'
His mom takes the dicks of four tricks!
5 Sep 21:39 - Tegan: Niiiiiice intro
5 Sep 21:48 - Owen: Whatup tegan palmer
Voice like a farmer.
Herder of llama.
Wearer of armour.

Yeah I know, that's not so good.
But it ain't bad for a guy from the hood.
I'll stop and continue you should.
While I pause and eat my pud.
5 Sep 21:52 - Dan Sluckin: O, your rhymes are so reckless,
We'll show you up as a ludicrous,
feckless, slow loris.
Less ability than Boris...
Johnson at rapping,
caught you napping, prattling
about other's mothers,
but yours ain't getting no thinner,
Time to shut up and eat your dinner.
5 Sep 21:53 - Shaggy: I like your rhymes but they're not quite mature, think for a bit and then when you're sure hit back, with rhyme that ain't whack, rhyme that will make me take smack, rhyme that will me take crack, crack my back, whack the smack and all that, sure
5 Sep 21:53 - Owen: Reckless and ludicrous rhyme in no way at all.

Other than that.  It was pretty good.
5 Sep 21:55 - Shaggy: Dan your rhymes rule, you've studied the school of cool, they literally make drool. You ain't no fool! Like poor O
5 Sep 22:04 - Dan Sluckin: I don't need no rhyming dictionary using critic,
The links and perfect timing, work when I just hit it.
If you read the flow like my man Shaggage
You'll find no space for baggage:
Ludicrous, said like the rapper, entrepreneur and actor
rhymes with reckless and is a determining factor,
In your freestyling downfall,
Your mind is so small,
I await your next reply, so
Alex Trofymenko,
Can just show
How its done yo.
5 Sep 22:04 - Dan Sluckin: Or alternatively teegz
Because I just want to play leagues...
5 Sep 22:14 - Owen: Ok I guess I have to play leagues now. That was excellent.
5 Sep 22:15 - Shaggy added Adimina
5 Sep 22:17 - Shaggy: That was hands down winner. I bow to dan "the rhyme buster" Ruddick.

6 Sep 12:34 - Vanessa: Generally they clip parts of their wings so they can't fly off

11 Sep 20:02 - Alex Bunn: Already at home bro
12 Sep 12:57 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: TIL: George Foreman has 5 sons called George, George, George, George and George
12 Sep 12:57 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: And a daughter called Georgetta
12 Sep 13:00 - Sam Roberts: That's nuts
12 Sep 13:00 - Sam Roberts: And a great Wikipedia read
12 Sep 13:01 - Joe Jarman: Must get confusing at Christmas
12 Sep 13:01 - Joe Jarman: Do they have nicknames

12 Sep 13:09 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: Lol
12 Sep 13:11 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: I like that he turned down Georgia, Georgie, Georgina for Georgetta!
12 Sep 13:12 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: Probly cause they don't keep the George intact
12 Sep 13:13 - Tegan: Roman numerals are always a stately option
12 Sep 13:13 - Sam Roberts: Think it's a cultural thing?, or he just really really loves himself?
12 Sep 13:14 - Sam Roberts: <Media omitted>
12 Sep 13:15 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: I read somewhere he convinced his wife to do it because he's shit at remembering names
12 Sep 13:15 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: What with the marbles he lost boxing
12 Sep 13:34 - Angela: Maybe he's just passing on his greatest legacy. The name of an amazing piece of kitchenware. Being called george Forman must open a lot of doors in life
12 Sep 13:35 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: His sons should change the name to George Fiveman
12 Sep 13:43 - Sam Roberts: Would you rather fight one George Fiveman sized George Foreman, or four George Foreman sized George Fivemans?
12 Sep 13:43 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: That's a question philosophers will be asking for many years to come I imagine Sam

12 Sep 14:32 - Joe Jarman: Does grandmaster flash have to be a page they've liked?
12 Sep 14:33 - Hannah Murphy: Nah it's just started making any old suggestions closest to what you're writing
12 Sep 14:33 - Hannah Murphy: Or perhaps old nana's just love the flashster
12 Sep 14:35 - Alex Bunn: Maybe thats what old people are calling themselves these days
12 Sep 14:35 - Alex Bunn: Its hard to keep up with trends
12 Sep 14:36 - Shaggy: I showed it to work peeps, they're tweeting it
12 Sep 14:38 - Hannah Murphy: From my 60th bday onwards, I would like to be know as 'grandmistress flash'
12 Sep 14:38 - Hannah Murphy: Thnx guys

12 Sep 18:05 - Adimina: Guys I would come... But Hamburg is just so nice
12 Sep 18:09 - Tegan: Bet you can't find a slow larry in Hamburg

13 Sep 09:47 - Angela: And what is that crazy spirit!!
13 Sep 09:50 - Shaggy: Drunken cycling again
13 Sep 09:59 - Owen: I think we should put a breathalyser on mikes bike that only lets him ride if he is below 4 times the legal limit.
13 Sep 10:23 - Phil: How will he get to work then?
13 Sep 11:27 - Bongo: Lol that's pretty funny
13 Sep 11:46 - Bongo: Just buy a leather jacket. problem, pavement?
13 Sep 11:49 - Dave: Yo bunn. Come join. We're near hackney wick
13 Sep 11:49 - Dave: Others welcome
13 Sep 12:08 - Dave: C town...is Tegan's phone at your place?
13 Sep 12:09 - Sam Roberts: Haven't seen it, any idea where?
13 Sep 12:12 - Dave: Let me call it
13 Sep 13:01 - Sam Roberts: Can't find it, it's going straight to answer phone as well, sorry teeg!
13 Sep 13:44 - Dave: Hmm, I'm sure it'll turn up
13 Sep 18:02 - Vanessa: Brunch at Adam's tomorrow from 3pm. Bring goodies
13 Sep 18:20 - Sam Roberts: Will have to skip, I'm entertaining papa all day tomorrow
13 Sep 18:20 - Sam Roberts: From the people who've been to the wellcome, worth it?
13 Sep 18:45 - Adimina: Would... But planning to get to sleep about 10am
13 Sep 19:20 - Dave: Tegs found her phone. You can stop looking...x
13 Sep 19:22 - Sam Roberts: Good, I was just ready for a break ;)
13 Sep 19:23 - Tegan: Thanks for all the hard work, guys :)
13 Sep 19:24 - Tegan: Wellcome is sweet, the exhibition is small, but the permanent exhibition is also worth a look
13 Sep 19:25 - Tegan: In the vacinity of the cider tap aswell, which is a home away from home for a West Country man
13 Sep 19:50 - Sam Roberts: Cider specific? The Roberts clan has never been too apple-centric
13 Sep 19:51 - Sam Roberts: Top tip though, cheers
13 Sep 19:52 - Dave: It's all cider but it has a beery brother over the road
13 Sep 19:54 - Sam Roberts: Sounds like a winning recipe for a powerful hangover, can't wait
13 Sep 19:58 - Tegan: The beer version is the Euston tap- it's much busier, with much more liklihood of having to stand on the pavement
13 Sep 20:15 - Tegan: <Media omitted>
13 Sep 20:15 - Tegan: Eric Cantona. 1987
13 Sep 21:46 - Angela: Rocking a Burberry hat too, years ahead of the curve

14 Sep 05:57 - Adimina: <Media omitted>
14 Sep 05:57 - Adimina: Fischmarkt
14 Sep 10:01 - Vanessa: Sorry guys brunch is postponed today
14 Sep 10:33 - Bongo: Lol that looks tasty
14 Sep 10:47 - Adimina: At 6:30 it was amazeballs
14 Sep 10:57 - Tegan: Mmmmm
14 Sep 10:58 - Tegan: Shall we do something else instead of brunch?
14 Sep 11:01 - Joe Jarman: Fry up
14 Sep 14:09 - Tegan: The time for fry ups may have passed
14 Sep 14:09 - Tegan: But if anyone fancies coming round for a beer and a board game you'd be more than welcome
14 Sep 14:32 - Tegan: Or out for a roast later?
14 Sep 14:32 - Tegan: Options
14 Sep 14:34 - Joe Jarman: Flint knapping in stoke Newington is an option
14 Sep 14:52 - Lorna: I was going to head to the old blue last later on, for some jazzy live music. Its free, and round the corner (from me at least)
14 Sep 14:57 - Tegan: Both sound intriguing
14 Sep 14:57 - Tegan: Will you be stripping out the copper as well, Joe?
14 Sep 16:54 - Tegan: (Have since looked up what flint knapping is- looks like fun)
14 Sep 18:24 - Joe Jarman: I know I'm gutted I didn't attend
15 Sep 15:49 - Alex Bunn: <Media omitted>
15 Sep 15:49 - Alex Bunn: <Media omitted>
15 Sep 16:32 - Tegan: Where's the second one from?
15 Sep 16:35 - Alex Bunn: Google extrafabulouscomics
15 Sep 16:52 - Adimina: Yo c town. I'm back from Hamburg today to take Phil's bed. Who is home when?
15 Sep 16:53 - Sam Roberts: Wooo! I'll be around about 6.30, we were just discussing making a pie, in?
15 Sep 16:55 - Alex Bunn: Yeah back around 6.30ish
15 Sep 16:55 - Alex Bunn: Bring wine
15 Sep 16:55 - Adimina: It's meat-free Monday so if it's a veggie pie then yes
15 Sep 16:56 - Adimina: I got y'all a postcard. Here's a sneak peek
15 Sep 16:56 - Alex Bunn: Afraid it has several types of meat
15 Sep 16:57 - Adimina: <Media omitted>
15 Sep 16:57 - Sam Roberts: That's a man
15 Sep 16:58 - Adimina: Hehehe

16 Sep 13:29 - Sam Roberts: I think it gets busier though, let me see if dreas is up for it
16 Sep 13:31 - Adimina: What time ya thinking?
16 Sep 13:31 - Tegan: 7ish?
16 Sep 13:32 - Adimina: Ah, gotta be in North London for 8 so I'll pass. But keen for a cling sometime
16 Sep 17:27 - Sam Roberts: Going to the usual place just now, if you fancy a Bermondsey climb I'll be there in 30 mins or so
16 Sep 19:18 - Adimina: Do I got a bit excited and tie dyed a dress... So of anyone needs to dye anything green our blue there is some outside... I'll be back later tonight to dispose of it if not
16 Sep 20:17 - Sam Roberts: Let's tie dye all Bunns pants, he loves hippy stuff like that
16 Sep 20:18 - Adimina: Or his work shirts?
16 Sep 20:18 - Sam Roberts: Even better! He's in the green division, guaranteed promotion
16 Sep 20:28 - Dave: Don't forget his hats...he hates that they're not all green
16 Sep 20:32 - Adimina: Oh, and his undies
16 Sep 20:33 - Dave: You always have to turn a serious conversation into something silly don't you...
16 Sep 20:36 - Adimina: I am dead serious. If Bunn doesn't have all green undies then he's not a real man
16 Sep 20:37 - Dave: Well as long as you're serious! Shame you don't have yellow dye, could get a teenage mutant teenage turtle theme going
16 Sep 20:38 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: Wait, do you mean this?
16 Sep 20:38 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: <Media omitted>
16 Sep 20:39 - Dave: They don't make cartoon news anchors the way they used to
16 Sep 20:39 - Dave: Sigh
16 Sep 20:58 - Bongo: Dat ass
16 Sep 21:44 - Sam Roberts: Going for a beer with the Bongo tomorrow, anyone fancy poping round for a sensible couple?
16 Sep 22:01 - Bongo: A mere tipple I assure thee
16 Sep 22:23 - Adimina: Well I'll be finishing work in the area around then

17 Sep 13:13 - Sam Roberts: Love that flat! I've got work stuff for a leaving do, might turn up a little tipsy around 11
17 Sep 13:36 - Adimina: Anyone keen to join me and Sam for the colour run weekend after next? We bed to be four for a team entry
17 Sep 13:37 - Bongo: What's a colour run and how far is it?

17 Sep 13:51 - Krizia: ÓÑÖ
17 Sep 13:52 - Sam Roberts: I've been lied to! The color run started as a holi thing, but this one isn't on holi which is always in spring
17 Sep 13:52 - Sam Roberts: Good comparative religion Bunn
17 Sep 13:53 - Alex Bunn: I remember holi was just after we left india in feb
17 Sep 14:15 - Krizia: ajhhhhhhhhhhhhh I just realised my friend is coming! !! We should do something amazing all weekend!!!
17 Sep 14:16 - Krizia: and then she could meet all you beautiful people from the other side of the world ÓÑÜ

17 Sep 15:47 - Bongo: I'm up for loud Mexican times
17 Sep 15:47 - Bongo: Also up for the colour run
17 Sep 15:48 - Krizia: She is gorgeous!!! to not say one of the most beautiful people I know! !
17 Sep 15:49 - Krizia: She is a musical actress so super fun to be around
17 Sep 15:50 - Owen: Well I don't know  about anyone else but that was a  good sell. I'm in. Let  us all gaze upon this beauty.
17 Sep 15:58 - Krizia: Hehe he well I'm just saying we should do something fun :)

17 Sep 19:01 - Alex Bunn: Hmm
17 Sep 19:01 - Alex Bunn: Might bail then
17 Sep 19:01 - Alex Bunn: Only wanted a quick one
17 Sep 19:02 - Tegan: Won't be long
17 Sep 19:02 - Tegan: I've had enough of this
17 Sep 19:05 - Bongo: Eta tegs?
17 Sep 19:05 - Bongo: Google says I'll be 15 mins

17 Sep 19:11 - Alex Bunn: This guy was bored and finished at 6
17 Sep 19:13 - Bongo: Lol I won't blame you if you leave, I'd rather be water boarded than bored
17 Sep 19:15 - Tegan: 13 minute walk from here
17 Sep 19:26 - Bongo: Just got here if anyone's around
17 Sep 19:27 - Bongo: The pints are on me
17 Sep 19:27 - Bongo: Just like an alcoholic milkybar kid
17 Sep 19:32 - Tegan: I'm outside Bong- let's enjoy this mild evening
17 Sep 19:48 - Alex Bunn: Yeah i went home
17 Sep 19:56 - Sam Roberts: Just tubing from Euston, the anchor still aye?
17 Sep 20:21 - Bongo: Aye
17 Sep 22:27 - Tegan: Owen owen owen, what was the pretty building game for phones you talked about, with the building interaction and such?
17 Sep 22:39 - Owen: ?
17 Sep 22:39 - Tegan: I need a game
17 Sep 22:39 - Tegan: You mentioned you were playing one
17 Sep 22:40 - Tegan: A building game
17 Sep 22:40 - Tegan: Where rabbits interact work blueberries and the like
17 Sep 22:40 - Owen: Terrestial?
17 Sep 22:40 - Owen: Ohhhh
17 Sep 22:40 - Owen: That's not a phone game
17 Sep 22:40 - Owen: Reus.
17 Sep 22:40 - Tegan: Bum
17 Sep 22:40 - Owen: It's really good.
17 Sep 22:40 - Tegan: I only need a phone game
17 Sep 22:41 - Owen: I am learning android to make a phone game with similar ideas.
17 Sep 22:41 - Owen: What kind of phone game?
17 Sep 22:43 - Tegan: A building game
17 Sep 22:43 - Tegan: With pretty
17 Sep 22:43 - Tegan: All crowd sourced suggestions welcome
17 Sep 22:48 - Sam Roberts: Terraria. Best game ever
17 Sep 23:09 - Owen: There aren't  many good phone  building  games.
17 Sep 23:10 - Sam Roberts: Ooh xconstructor
17 Sep 23:10 - Owen: Tiny tower was pretty addictive but it was one of those stupid wait  4 hours for something to  finish.
17 Sep 23:10 - Sam Roberts: Not sure if it's on iPhone, but it's awesome
17 Sep 23:10 - Owen: X constructor?
17 Sep 23:10 - Owen: That sounds good. What is it?
17 Sep 23:10 - Sam Roberts: I think that's it, where you build railway bridges and trains go over them
17 Sep 23:11 - Sam Roberts: But if you build them badly, everyone dies
17 Sep 23:18 - Owen: Nice
17 Sep 23:34 - Joe Jarman: Hey Owen how good with android are you
17 Sep 23:34 - Joe Jarman: I'm starting a coursesa course in a few days
17 Sep 23:35 - Joe Jarman: Looking for others interested
17 Sep 23:35 - Joe Jarman: Also I've been messing about with unity as well
18 Sep 00:24 - Owen: I'm about 1/4 of the way through my book. I have got the basics and am now using fragments. It's a pretty neat setup. Very scalable, but that means that you have to do quite a lot for even the simplest app. Fortunately android released a development  kit pre bundled with eclipse which takes away loads of the legwork  that existed when android was first  released. I haven't  looked into unity, mainly because I don't have an apple. What's  it like?
18 Sep 09:01 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: What's the predictions for Scotland vote then?
18 Sep 09:02 - Angela: I think it'll be a no, what do you think?
18 Sep 09:02 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: I reckon no too, morbidly curious to see a yes vote though...
18 Sep 09:02 - Angela: I didn't think I was bothered but actually I would be a bit sad if they voted yes
18 Sep 09:03 - Angela: Like being dumped by someone I completely took for granted all these years
18 Sep 09:03 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: Lol
18 Sep 09:03 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: And all those cyclists. Damn
18 Sep 09:04 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: 55% no, that's my bet
18 Sep 09:06 - Sam Roberts: Cyclists?
18 Sep 09:06 - Martha: Reckon 52% no - a bit too close for comfort
18 Sep 09:06 - Sam Roberts: I'm not sure I care about the really. The important thing is it sets the stage for Cornish independence, which is way overdue
18 Sep 09:07 - Sam Roberts: *result
18 Sep 09:07 - Sam Roberts: They actually have their own currency, take that Scotland
18 Sep 09:08 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: Yeah think about all those gold medals we got in the cycling!
18 Sep 09:08 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: I reckon no's are underreporting. I'd be surprised by a yes vote
18 Sep 09:13 - Angela: I agree, I think 55% at least for no
18 Sep 09:18 - Dave: I think I would be happy either way: excited for an independent Scotland, content to see an island united.
18 Sep 09:20 - Dave: The underreporting point is true though the polls may not be very reliable. There was a chap from yougov on the radio the other day saying that polls are usually weighted to control for the way they are sampled however this process requires historical data
18 Sep 09:20 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: There's no exit polls! Bullshit, where's the fun in that?
18 Sep 09:20 - Dave: There isn't any such data for this referendum but the weighting process has been done anyway which can skew the results
18 Sep 09:24 - Joe Jarman: Ungrateful Scots costing us a fortune yes or no, best just to cull the lot of em. Off to collect my dole money ÓêÖ
18 Sep 09:25 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: You know betfair have already paid out on no? Thats pretty cocky...
18 Sep 09:26 - Angela: While they weight the results for sampling, they can't weight them for people lying. All the polls in 1992 predicted a labour win but it turned out that voting conservative was so uncool that people just didn't want to admit to it
18 Sep 09:26 - Dave: What happens if it's yes? Do they have to return the money?
18 Sep 09:27 - Angela: Probably voting no is seen as boring but actually people do want the safer option?
18 Sep 09:28 - Alex Bunn: I'm for a yes vote
18 Sep 09:28 - Dave: Maybe, bit I wonder how many people, when in the ballot box, will let the excitement take over and change to yes
18 Sep 09:28 - Alex Bunn: I bet they could have a more progressive country if they cut London loose
18 Sep 09:31 - Alex Bunn: Great Britain is renamed, not-so-great-anymore Britain
18 Sep 09:32 - Krizia: I think the contrary actually happens in the ballot box a lot of people take the safe option or they change right there!
18 Sep 09:32 - Alex Bunn: Not-as-united as before Kindom
18 Sep 09:33 - Krizia: I can't wait for this to be over! !! its boring at work all is Scott here there! ! Common
18 Sep 09:43 - Sam Roberts: They'll all be deported tomorrow, it'll be a lonely Friday for you!
18 Sep 09:49 - Krizia: Hehe well if I had a vote I would say yes!!! Let's start a revolution just for the sake of it!!
18 Sep 09:54 - Alex Bunn: Thats the spirit!
18 Sep 09:56 - Dave: Yay!
18 Sep 09:57 - Adimina: If the Scots leave then soon enough we'll have Wales and the rest of Ireland jumping ship too
18 Sep 09:57 - Adimina: Then well just be "Britain"
18 Sep 09:57 - Alex Bunn: Wales and Ireland dont have any oil
18 Sep 09:59 - Alex Bunn: But i would quite like to see Wales go it alone
18 Sep 09:59 - Alex Bunn: They could export loveliness
18 Sep 10:05 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: Let's have a London referendum! Fuck everyone else!
18 Sep 10:05 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: Except Hatfield
18 Sep 10:07 - Owen: I hope it is a yes. That would be an awesome experiment.
18 Sep 10:08 - Owen: One that we can observe but that really doesn't  affect us much.
18 Sep 10:08 - Sam Roberts: Whisky prices will go up
18 Sep 10:08 - Sam Roberts: It's the only effect on my life I can think of
18 Sep 10:11 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: Gold medals in cycling will plummet
18 Sep 10:11 - Vanessa: England is starting to produce some good whiskey
18 Sep 10:11 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: People keep ignoring the big issues
18 Sep 10:12 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: Do we still get to claim someone from the uk won Wimbledon?
18 Sep 10:12 - Owen: Will they? That depends on  a lot of factors: Import  and export tax between England and Scotland, whether the new scoring government  decides to subsidise whiskey, EU trade rules.
18 Sep 10:14 - Sam Roberts: It won't go down
18 Sep 10:14 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: It also depends on whether we decide to put Hadrian's wall back up
18 Sep 10:14 - Sam Roberts: We're only losing Hoy, and without the superior british bikes and training, he'll dwindle to a hollowed has been
18 Sep 10:21 - Alex Bunn: He'll dwindle to a hollowed has been anyway
18 Sep 10:21 - Alex Bunn: Ha!
18 Sep 10:21 - Alex Bunn: Ageing
18 Sep 10:22 - Alex Bunn: I think claiming Andy Murray as our own has been a gigantic push for Scottish independence
18 Sep 10:24 - Owen: It could go down sam. It is a big industry. Wouldn't be suprised if a Scotland in charge of thier own economy decide to subsidise it loads. That coupled with EU trade laws would mean no export tax to Britain.
18 Sep 10:25 - Owen: France subsidise thier wine industry considerably.

18 Sep 12:51 - Owen: Too many times.

24 Sep 21:45 - Sam Roberts: Trees!
24 Sep 21:45 - Sam Roberts: Yees!
24 Sep 21:45 - Adimina: Haha sweet. Coming
25 Sep 06:45 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: <Media omitted>
25 Sep 10:18 - Adimina: Hey c-towners. Where is this cheap racist hairdresser I can go to for a short back and sides
25 Sep 10:19 - Shaggy: I think you should grow a mullet
25 Sep 10:23 - Adimina: That is an option...
25 Sep 10:48 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: Peter's. He may also be sexist in which case you'll have to pretend to be a guy
25 Sep 10:50 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: He's really crap btw, I just go there out of habit now
25 Sep 10:54 - Adimina: Haha... I do look a bit like a boy
25 Sep 10:54 - Adimina: How can you mess up short back and sides though?
25 Sep 10:56 - Owen: By doing long back and sides instead.
25 Sep 10:56 - Owen: Like a monk.
25 Sep 11:00 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: One time he forgot to cut one of the sides, and I had to remind him
25 Sep 11:03 - Adimina: Hahaha
25 Sep 11:03 - Tegan: Lol
25 Sep 11:28 - Owen: A kid just dislocated his knee. On my break duty!
25 Sep 11:38 - Vanessa: Just pop it in place
25 Sep 11:38 - Owen: Instructions unclear. Now he has two dislocated knees.
25 Sep 11:39 - Vanessa: Now you can call for an ambulance
25 Sep 11:40 - Owen: Instructions unclear. Now he has an ambulance stuck under his kneecap.
25 Sep 11:45 - Shaggy: Get off your phone and help the damn kid
25 Sep 11:45 - Owen: Instructions unclear. Now my phone is duct taped to his forehead!
25 Sep 12:43 - Bongo: Skirt size linked to breast cancer?!
25 Sep 12:44 - Bongo: I've seriously had enough of bbc news
25 Sep 12:48 - Owen: Wait shorter or longer?
25 Sep 12:49 - Owen: Shorter skirt size linked to breast cancer - Christian union says.

Long skirt size linked to breast cancer - playboy magazine says.
25 Sep 12:49 - Owen: One might begin to question thier motivations.
25 Sep 12:50 - Tegan: Ha
25 Sep 12:50 - Owen: Also if it's long skirts that cause breast cancer does that mean we can stop victim blaming when a woman in a short skirt gets raped because she was just trying to protect herself from cancer.
25 Sep 12:51 - Tegan: I think they mean skirt size causes cancer.
25 Sep 12:55 - Owen: It's like the people who do these studies have never heard of comorbidity.
25 Sep 12:55 - Angela: So if I wear jeans? No cancer?
25 Sep 12:55 - Tegan: Solved!
25 Sep 12:55 - Angela: Wait... Jean skirts though
25 Sep 12:56 - Angela: No jean skirts
25 Sep 12:56 - Dave: Which way round is the correlation? Should I wear skirts?
25 Sep 12:57 - Tegan: Perhaps you should do a pamphlet
25 Sep 12:57 - Tegan: But not wearing skirts doesn't stop you have a skirt size
25 Sep 12:57 - Tegan: So yes dave
25 Sep 12:57 - Tegan: You should
25 Sep 12:57 - Joe Jarman: Why isn't it bum size linked to breast cancer
25 Sep 12:58 - Owen: The skirt doesn't even cover the breasts!  How the hell would it cause them to get cancer!
25 Sep 12:58 - Joe Jarman: Although I imagine there is some seriously positive correlation with bum size and boob size
25 Sep 13:00 - Bongo: I reckon we should all just go naked from the waist down to avoid looking stupid
25 Sep 13:02 - Joe Jarman: Naaaah waist up, nobody wants to see that bongo, put it away!
25 Sep 13:04 - Owen: Wait. So a size 8 is less likely to get cancer than a size 14. Why don't they just say people who are larger are generally less healthy. The skirt thing is irrelevant!!!
25 Sep 13:09 - Vanessa: I'm not sure where they got the correlation of waist size for breast cancer. But there is a definite relation between waist size and heart disease, which is not a cancer
25 Sep 13:09 - Vanessa: I just read the article and it's pretty poorly written
25 Sep 13:48 - Alex Bunn: Pints in the george tonight?
25 Sep 13:56 - Dave: Doig! Not sure. What's the occasion?
25 Sep 14:13 - Shaggy: Going to that gig in angel tonight
25 Sep 14:23 - Alex Bunn: Thursday is the occassion
25 Sep 15:02 - Tegan: Can't celebrate Thursday this week

25 Sep 17:06 - Vanessa: Did you receive an email?
25 Sep 17:12 - Shaggy: Just because you applied doesn't mean you have the tickets
25 Sep 17:52 - Sam Roberts: Pretty sure I got a thing, let me check
25 Sep 17:58 - Sam Roberts: Boo. Got an email saying application received
25 Sep 17:59 - Sam Roberts: You going for a drink?I need a drink

25 Sep 18:28 - Vanessa: Should be there in about 10
25 Sep 18:28 - Shaggy: Or rather will be, it's being refurbished, so spoons it is
25 Sep 18:31 - Sam Roberts: 'Mazing, got caught up, be there in 10
25 Sep 18:37 - Vanessa: They have kraken so all is good
25 Sep 18:37 - Sam Roberts: Try and get an outdoors seat, I want to smoke and drink beer
25 Sep 18:38 - Adimina: What time gig starting? Kickboxing note in Camden
25 Sep 18:39 - Shaggy: No seats outside
25 Sep 18:49 - Sam Roberts: Flip mode,, to the castle!
25 Sep 18:50 - Sam Roberts: Doors open at 7, gig starts at 8
25 Sep 18:50 - Adimina: Soooo... I'll be done here 8:15 if I go to the session
25 Sep 18:51 - Adimina: Kk.. I'll come now instead
25 Sep 18:51 - Vanessa: Where's the castle?
25 Sep 18:55 - Shaggy: Flip mode again, spoons

25 Sep 19:28 - cate fuchter: Awesome.
26 Sep 01:06 - Sam Roberts: I've learnt that if you're blind, it's all hot
26 Sep 06:59 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: Poet. How drunk did you guys get last night?
26 Sep 08:13 - Martha: Congratulations cate, that's awesome, sounds like you've sold a lot of Japanese holiday happiness!! How much time do you have left for the monkey 300?
26 Sep 08:44 - cate fuchter: Thanks Marth! 3 days left. On the bus right now with eye of the tiger playing in my head ÓÅêÓÅê

26 Sep 08:45 - Tegan: Win it like the 80s, Cate!  Xx
26 Sep 09:01 - Martha: Montage scene. GO CATE!
26 Sep 09:32 - Owen: How much is the bonus? If it is more then 300 the rational choice would be to just buy yourself a monkey (or whatever percentage of a monkey is equal to 300).
26 Sep 10:04 - cate fuchter: Haha. The bonus is 10%. Or five monkies (?) Not sure where this cost of monkey estimate has come from Owen!
26 Sep 10:07 - Adimina: üôäÓàÅüôâÓÑïüôàÓîüüòÜ
26 Sep 11:03 - Owen: 10% of everything over the bonus limit? Or 10% of all your sales for the month?
26 Sep 12:11 - Adimina: So I just discovered that since 2011 LOL has been formally recognized in the Oxford dictionary

26 Sep 12:41 - Dave: Roffle sounds good
26 Sep 12:44 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: Yeah actually roffle can stay
26 Sep 12:50 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: Omguh I just got cherry flavoured Pepsi instead of Pepsi flavoured Pepsi. Fummle.
26 Sep 12:54 - Sam Roberts: I started saying omg like an American schoolgirl to be edgy and ironic, after a week I was just talking like an American schoolgirl
26 Sep 12:57 - Adimina: I'm the same with soz. Out started out ironically, but now I genuinely mean sorry

28 Sep 16:50 - Bongo: What's the BBQ situation like?
28 Sep 16:54 - Sam Roberts: We're through round 1, having meat naps currently
28 Sep 16:54 - Sam Roberts: Addy's left us some homemade burgers if you fancy one
28 Sep 16:57 - Tegan: Sorry to miss this momentous occasion
28 Sep 16:57 - Tegan: Needs to be a Sunday of penitence though
28 Sep 16:57 - Sam Roberts: You were in our hearts
28 Sep 16:58 - Sam Roberts: What happened?
28 Sep 16:58 - Tegan: My parents were staying
28 Sep 16:59 - Tegan: Feel like if we can't get through a weekend of moderation with them then I'm pretty much genetically screwed
28 Sep 16:59 - Tegan: And I will always have to have sunday hangovers
29 Sep 08:34 - Sam Roberts: Sorry to do a Hannah guys but...
29 Sep 08:34 - Sam Roberts: <Media omitted>
29 Sep 08:44 - Tegan: That's tomorrow aswell! You double life leader you
29 Sep 08:59 - Sam Roberts: Hehe 'climbing'
29 Sep 08:59 - Sam Roberts: I'm really intrigued, might pop along and see what my id gets me into
29 Sep 09:31 - Shaggy: Lol!
29 Sep 09:54 - Alex Bunn: To youtube!
29 Sep 10:28 - Owen: Your like Ron Swanson sam.
29 Sep 10:28 - Owen: You're*
29 Sep 10:49 - Adimina: So it's almost October. Anyone keen to arrange a trip to Thorpe Park Fright Nights
29 Sep 10:51 - Krizia: Sam!!!! He loves the rollercoasters ;)
29 Sep 10:51 - Krizia: And me!! I haven't been in a park for ages!  I always faint though
29 Sep 11:04 - Sam Roberts: I've never been on a roller coaster, feels a little strange to make it to 28 and then pop my cherry
29 Sep 11:06 - Dave: It'll be even stranger of you make it to 29
29 Sep 11:06 - Dave: if
29 Sep 11:08 - Adimina: Haha true. Even numbers are best
29 Sep 12:28 - Alex Bunn: Ive never been on one of those massive ones either
29 Sep 12:29 - Shaggy: That's what she said
29 Sep 12:32 - Alex Bunn: <Media omitted>
29 Sep 12:36 - Owen: Sam. My pension counts as an untaxed allowance correct?
29 Sep 12:37 - Owen: So my taxable income is my income minus my pension.
29 Sep 12:37 - Owen: And minus NI?
29 Sep 12:40 - Owen: Wait. The ¬£10,000 limit before you start having to pay tax counts as an allowance.
29 Sep 12:41 - Owen: ?
29 Sep 12:41 - Owen: Be on lunch break already. I want answers!!
29 Sep 12:44 - Owen: Never mind. I figured it out.
29 Sep 12:45 - Owen: By the way. If you earn less than 41k then tax on dividends is only 10% compared to the 20% on regular savings. If you earn more than that then dividend tax is 32.5%
29 Sep 12:46 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: Banter
29 Sep 12:47 - Owen: Lel
29 Sep 12:47 - Owen: What I just said was wrong anyway.
29 Sep 12:47 - Owen: There is a 10% tax credit.
29 Sep 12:48 - Owen: So if you earn below 41k you pay no tax on dividends.
29 Sep 12:48 - Owen: And 22.5% if you earn more than 41k.
29 Sep 12:48 - Shaggy: Yawn
29 Sep 12:49 - Owen: Fine. Go invest your money somewhere stupid like up your arse!
29 Sep 12:50 - Shaggy: I invest my money into beer, and my fund, read stomach, has swollen enough to show that it's a good choice
29 Sep 12:51 - Tegan: Plus investment in liver cirrhosis at this stage negates the need to think about retirement plans
29 Sep 12:52 - Tegan: Morbid, yet simple
29 Sep 12:53 - Owen: Ok well I'm going to choose companies with a high price to earnings ratio and..... who am I kidding I'll invest in booze as well.
29 Sep 12:54 - Adimina: Woo boozevestment
29 Sep 12:57 - Sam Roberts: Great bant-ccountancy Owen, thanks
29 Sep 12:58 - Sam Roberts: And the 10% credit means you actually get money back for getting dividend income, it's to encourage poor people to invest in the market, which I find weird on a few levels
29 Sep 12:59 - Adimina: In other news. I just watched three episodes of parks and rec back to back
29 Sep 12:59 - Alex Bunn: Get a job
29 Sep 13:00 - Adimina: I have a job. It's called couch tuner
29 Sep 13:01 - Alex Bunn: Haha. Aw man i wish i was watching parks and rec!
29 Sep 13:03 - Adimina: You could be. If you quit. He he he
29 Sep 13:04 - Adimina: True fact: addiction to parks and rec us the heading cause of unemployment
29 Sep 13:05 - Tegan: Neither true, nor a fact. But 'true fact' is a truism.
29 Sep 13:05 - Tegan: So there's that
29 Sep 13:06 - Tegan: Man, I'm in a monday mood. Sigh.
29 Sep 13:07 - Alex Bunn: I just ate a lovely Gulash from EAT
29 Sep 13:07 - Alex Bunn: That helped
29 Sep 13:07 - Tegan: I decided to try itsu again. Bad decision.
29 Sep 13:07 - Tegan: That shit is nasty.
29 Sep 13:10 - Krizia: Hahahaha !   I'm in I won't work again mood, so I'll participate in any sort of conversa!!! it's been a very very slow day :$
29 Sep 13:16 - Lorna: I leave my job tomorrow. So anything I do badly today is someone else's problem. Comforting. And in no way motivating.
29 Sep 13:17 - Krizia: ÓåíÓåíÓåí congrats! !!
29 Sep 13:37 - Tegan: Party cones!
29 Sep 14:45 - Sam Roberts: I love itsu! The rare salmon steak is one of my all time favorite work lunches
29 Sep 15:14 - Tegan: They leave a lot to be desired in the world of noodle soups
29 Sep 15:15 - Tegan: Tomato soup isn't Japanese!
29 Sep 15:15 - Tegan: They have taken 'fusion' to a terrible place
29 Sep 15:23 - Hannah Murphy: Soup is poor but their sushi is the top
29 Sep 15:27 - Tegan: They also don't do any veg sushi really
29 Sep 15:27 - Tegan: Which makes wasabi my lunchtime fave
29 Sep 15:33 - Angela: Itsu used to have some really nice veggie potsu but they have got rid of them and replaced them with chicken and duck. I was mighty disappointed and now all their veggie food sucks
29 Sep 15:34 - Angela: Apart from "selected stores", lucky bastards.
29 Sep 15:35 - Angela: Best veggie sushi is crushh. Crussh?
29 Sep 15:35 - Angela: It all looks wrong!

30 Sep 16:03 - Angela: I don't even know how to express how that comment made me feel
30 Sep 16:03 - Angela: A cross between amusement and horror
30 Sep 16:04 - Angela: üôÄüòøüòπ

30 Sep 20:52 - Vanessa: They used their charm to get in
30 Sep 21:04 - Alex Bunn: Gay
30 Sep 21:22 - Sam Roberts: I changed the bouncer's perception of homoerotica
30 Sep 21:22 - Sam Roberts: Nohomo
30 Sep 21:23 - Bongo: Everything about that sentence was indeedhomo
30 Sep 21:23 - Bongo: That's like saying "I hate Jews"
30 Sep 21:23 - Bongo: Noantisemetic
30 Sep 21:25 - Alex Bunn: <Media omitted>
30 Sep 22:06 - Owen: Whats the story sam?

6 Oct 13:22 - Angela: Awesome, that sounds perfect!
6 Oct 13:26 - Angela: The cat is slightly high maintenance - the one time we ever left her alone overnight she brought a revenge pigeon into the house (her only ever kill), so as long as you can be in the house at least at some point overnight she should be fine!
6 Oct 13:27 - Angela: I live in streatham btw if that's ok for you?
6 Oct 14:32 - Owen: Angela you could train your cat to go to the loo like the cat in meet the parents.

14 Oct 10:56 - Krizia: Seeing me twice a week :p
14 Oct 10:57 - Krizia: Hoho no I really don't know!! Joe?
14 Oct 10:59 - Owen: Why do you want to learn spanish dave. Are you planning on eloping with kritzia, much to sam's dismay?
14 Oct 11:00 - Dave: Erm.....no?
14 Oct 11:00 - Owen: Sounds suspicious.
14 Oct 11:00 - Krizia: Why won't you learn Spanish??
14 Oct 11:01 - Krizia: It's a beaaauuuttiiful language
14 Oct 11:05 - Hannah Murphy: Go on international house
14 Oct 11:06 - Hannah Murphy: They do semi -intensive courses (twice a week) for only 25¬£ - if you do a special option where you're being taught by trainee teachers (rather than qualified ones)
14 Oct 11:09 - Dave: I saw that it was cheap - is the teaching good?
14 Oct 11:50 - Joe Jarman: What do you want, start from basics book style learning, conversation practice or wat?
14 Oct 11:50 - Joe Jarman: I've never had a spanish lesson üòê
14 Oct 11:56 - Dave: I'll need to start from the very beginning. I like the idea of some lessons to get the conversational side and it's nice to have a teacher.
14 Oct 11:56 - Dave: What did you do before going travelling?
14 Oct 11:57 - Sam Roberts: I'd be interested in joining if you find something Dave, I've always wondered what Kriz is saying
14 Oct 11:59 - Krizia: Hahahhaha!!! You don't want to know ;)
14 Oct 11:59 - Joe Jarman: I watched a lot of tv and had a spanish lady friend aaaand did an audio course a while ago. Went to Espa√±a a few times, did duolingo which is great but you can't beat conversation practice with local people
14 Oct 11:59 - Joe Jarman: Because that's your end goal right
14 Oct 12:00 - Joe Jarman: So check out italki and verbling web sites
14 Oct 12:00 - Joe Jarman: There's butcket loads of spics to Make friends with in London too ÓêÖ
14 Oct 12:02 - Joe Jarman: I think I'm shit now because of a lack of conversation practice but I still understand a lot
14 Oct 12:03 - Sam Roberts: I got on really well with duolingo, really fun way to learn some basics, I feel like a commitment now would help a lot though
14 Oct 12:05 - Owen: Just shout loads and say everything is beuuutiiifullll. Thats spanish isn't it?
14 Oct 12:18 - Joe Jarman: That's what krizea does definitely Óêâ
14 Oct 12:39 - Krizia: Hahahhaha
14 Oct 12:40 - Krizia: Seguro!!!!
14 Oct 12:41 - Krizia: Dave if I can help in any way let me know!!!  I'm sure you'll be a better student than Sam
14 Oct 12:48 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: Lol, burn
14 Oct 13:08 - Sam Roberts: She's a bit molesty as a teacher, you probably want to study somewhere public
14 Oct 13:09 - Krizia: Hehe true!!! Can't help it ;)
14 Oct 16:37 - Phil: Is it to late to sign up for this Spanish/groping session? I want to get my hands on some Dave.

20 Oct 12:01 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: As Marilyn said, If Lora can't handle us at our worst, she doesn't deserve us at our best
20 Oct 12:50 - Owen: Why would anyone have a problem with a picture of marylin monroe?
20 Oct 13:04 - Adimina: She's competition
20 Oct 13:04 - Alex Bunn: That link
20 Oct 13:04 - Alex Bunn: Bleh

20 Oct 13:06 - Adimina: Hahaha. Agreed with Bunn. It's an awful link... It may lead to sweet delicious Marilyn, but the link itself Óêá
20 Oct 13:06 - Lorna: Doesn't really help your argument
20 Oct 13:46 - Adimina: Hey kids, so erryone who wants to come Saturday the place is booked at 1:45 so I suggest meeting at Uxbridge station at 12:30 in full kigu if possible. We cab either get a public transport bus which takes Ca. 20-30 min, or I book a taxi for fifteen purple or so (Phil kinda knows wagwan just not specifics)... Also if you've no idea what I'm on about message me directly.
20 Oct 14:42 - Martha: You can probably take a bike on the train since its a weekend, so I'll probably do that, any other takers?
20 Oct 14:51 - Shaggy: Sounds like a good idea
20 Oct 14:53 - Adimina: Hmmm yea bike actually would be cool
20 Oct 16:35 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: You can't cycle from Canning town to Uxbridge
20 Oct 16:36 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: Well I mean, you can, but it will take like 2 hours
20 Oct 16:37 - Alex Bunn: Bike on train
20 Oct 16:38 - Alex Bunn: Then cycle the rest once train reaches station
20 Oct 16:42 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: What train?
20 Oct 16:43 - Adimina: Metropolitan
20 Oct 16:43 - Joe Jarman: That's not a train
20 Oct 16:43 - Joe Jarman: Ie no bike
20 Oct 16:44 - Sam Roberts: You can do it from anywhere it goes overground, so cycle to baker street or something
20 Oct 16:44 - Sam Roberts: Not the dlr though, I got stung like that once
20 Oct 16:45 - Alex Bunn: Yeah i was thinking cycle to west london first
20 Oct 16:45 - Alex Bunn: All sounds like quite a lot of effort tbh!
20 Oct 16:45 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: You guys are keen!
20 Oct 16:46 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: I am not gonna risk getting drunk afterwards
20 Oct 16:46 - Joe Jarman: 3.5 mile cycle from slough train station
20 Oct 16:52 - Adimina: Metro, overground, dlr and circle/district allow trains off peak
20 Oct 16:52 - Adimina: I am pro lazy
20 Oct 16:53 - Sam Roberts: https://www.tfl.gov.uk/cdn/static/cms/documents/bicycle-tube-map.pdf
20 Oct 16:57 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: I think we should take non-kigu clothes with us, they might not be cool with it
20 Oct 16:58 - Martha: London marylebone to denham station (chiltern railways towards Aylesbury), followed by a 15 minute cycle.
20 Oct 16:58 - Alex Bunn: üëç
20 Oct 17:24 - Dave: So you all know, Denham is outside of the oyster range so make sure you get tickets if that's your plan
20 Oct 17:25 - Martha: Good shout, thanks doc!
20 Oct 17:27 - Joe Jarman: Sounds expensive, what's the difference between that and uxbridge oyster business?
20 Oct 17:42 - Adimina: I reation cheaper to oyster to Uxbridge
20 Oct 17:44 - Dave: Its 3 quid off peak to Uxbridge from zone 1, unless its changes since march
20 Oct 17:46 - Adimina: Young persons rail card!
20 Oct 17:50 - Dave: Youth is wasted on the young

23 Oct 11:54 - Owen: That is the kind of sweet shit I'm talking about shaggy. Who wants a cure for malaria when we could have ninja turtles. Once you have ninja turtles the cure for malaria inevitably follows.

Then i realised you meant the camping shop.
4 Nov 12:59 - Owen: Maybe they are avid campers. Thats not a sterotype I have heard though.
4 Nov 13:05 - Adimina: Racist Owen
4 Nov 13:08 - Joe Jarman: Black people hate camping, thus more.likely to give up sleeping bags?! Óêâ
4 Nov 16:57 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: TIL I've lived in the 3 most unaffordable cities in the country woooo!
4 Nov 16:57 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: Seriously, still gonna be renting when I'm 40 üò©
4 Nov 17:00 - Alex Bunn: Oxford, cambridge and london
4 Nov 17:00 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: Yip
4 Nov 17:01 - Alex Bunn: Yeah lets not talk about rent. We might never leave ctown
4 Nov 17:08 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: 4 MORE YEARS! 4 MORE YEARS!
4 Nov 19:01 - Lorna: Maybe you could afford a deposit and buy the house if you all club together...
4 Nov 19:04 - Owen: You clearly haven't seen how much money that house spends on beer lorna üòÉ
4 Nov 19:05 - Owen: They could probably get the deposit by saving up a week's worth of empties and selling the aluminum.
4 Nov 19:11 - Bongo: Yea but then the cleaner wouldn't have anything to pick up
4 Nov 19:26 - Sam Roberts: Can't believe she's lasted so long
4 Nov 19:26 - Sam Roberts: Even through bin-gate, and this Saturday's binge fest
4 Nov 19:28 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: Didn't the landlord get it for like 50k?
4 Nov 21:26 - Sam Roberts: ¬£50 and a bag full of nails
4 Nov 21:55 - Bongo: Lol bin-gate
4 Nov 21:57 - Bongo: Some witch was like "have this house on yonder but beware! mould grows everywhere, ye shall be plagued by rats and forever there will be the foulest stench enflicted upon man"
4 Nov 21:57 - Bongo: But lucky for him he found you guys
4 Nov 22:13 - Owen: I think the foul stench will clear itself right up when phil goes abroad for a bit.
4 Nov 22:21 - Sam Roberts: That's the only thing keeping the mould at bay
5 Nov 01:14 - Adimina: Ah but its really not
5 Nov 08:40 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: <Media omitted>
5 Nov 09:14 - Alex Bunn: White power!

5 Nov 12:57 - Owen: A conversation i just overheard between two kids: "do you think scorpion from mortal kombat could overcome the combined might of the chaos gods on battle?"... I teach such nerds!
5 Nov 12:57 - Owen: They are literally like comic book guy from the simpsons.
5 Nov 12:59 - Sam Roberts: .... well could he?
5 Nov 13:01 - Adimina: <Media omitted>
5 Nov 13:01 - Adimina: Look who's come to say hello
5 Nov 13:03 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: Scorpion ain't all that
5 Nov 13:33 - Phil: Shut your dirty mouth mike you sub human sub zero fanboy. Obviously scorpion can't battle all the chaos gods but he'd do better than pretty much anyone else.
5 Nov 14:07 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: People just like scorpion cause of the stupid sob story. He's like those contestants on X factor who are on there cause their dad died even though everyone knows they won't win
5 Nov 14:14 - Alex Bunn: üëèüëè
5 Nov 14:29 - Phil: The sob story came later when the drooling masses couldn't handle that a bad ass ninja had no back story beyond being a bad ass ninja.
5 Nov 14:48 - Shaggy: Yellow is a pretty awesome colour
5 Nov 14:50 - Owen: Scorpion is a pretty awesome animal.
5 Nov 15:26 - Dave: Skulls are cool
5 Nov 15:43 - Shaggy: And so is fire
5 Nov 16:00 - Phil: Also, harpoons.
5 Nov 16:13 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: These are dumb arguments
5 Nov 16:16 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: He's a cheap-ass teleporting bitch
5 Nov 16:19 - Phil: Someone got his ass beat by scorpion to many times. He was just the vessel man.
5 Nov 17:48 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: <Media omitted>
5 Nov 18:12 - Sam Roberts: Hahaahahahah
5 Nov 18:52 - Adimina: No one loves me so I'm heading to Heathrow now. See y'all on the flip side

9 Nov 20:14 - Martha: Yes. Have to buy them in advance since it usually sells out. There may not be many left next to each other though. Would people prefer to be loners sitting on their own or should we go for Tuesday?
9 Nov 20:15 - Sam Roberts: I'm totally climbing Tuesday, well in for tomorrow though
9 Nov 20:15 - Sam Roberts: Can we see how next to each other we are? Pairs would be ok

11 Nov 09:42 - Dave: Can you imagine?
11 Nov 10:48 - Sam Roberts: Thought it was a super racist headline in first glance, I'm much happier at the thought of ninja terrorist Mike
11 Nov 12:46 - Phil: I think that is the closest anyone can reasonably come to being called a teenage mutant ninja turtle by a newspaper. Congrats mike.

12 Nov 10:33 - Alex Bunn: I think interstellar is worth a second watch
12 Nov 10:33 - Alex Bunn: With lowered expectations
12 Nov 10:33 - Alex Bunn: There was a lot to be appreciated in that film
12 Nov 10:33 - Alex Bunn: But there was also a lot that was lame
12 Nov 10:34 - Owen: Phil needs to see it again definitely. Because he spent half the film in the loo
12 Nov 10:34 - Alex Bunn: Shit. Probably not worth a convo here cos theres peeps that havnt seen it
12 Nov 10:34 - Henry Dranks: I absolutely loved it. beautiful homage to some of my fav scifi
12 Nov 10:34 - Sam Roberts: It's weird, I really enjoyed maybe 9/10 of it, but felt cheated by the end
12 Nov 10:34 - Owen: The last 15 minutes just shouldn't have been in the film
12 Nov 10:35 - Tegan: Lots of Sci Fi films s have that quality though
12 Nov 10:36 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: Yeah like Source Code
12 Nov 10:37 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: Interstellar was pretty daft, can't say I wasn't entertained though
12 Nov 10:37 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: Low marks for the Barbican cinema though
12 Nov 10:37 - Shaggy: I think Matthew mcconaghey had a speech impediment, did he have a stroke?
12 Nov 10:37 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: I think its more that the sound was shit
12 Nov 10:38 - Owen: Yeah barbican cinema was rubbish
12 Nov 10:38 - Owen: Barbican't  more like! Amiright?!
12 Nov 10:38 - Alex Bunn: Yeah i think we might have had a better experience somewhere else
12 Nov 10:38 - Alex Bunn: My fave was the sarcastic robot
12 Nov 10:38 - Shaggy: IMAX
12 Nov 10:49 - Martha: Meh, I agree the screen was pretty weeny, but it was nice to go somewhere close to me for once. Thank you folks for coming to my neck of the woods! That wins you 3 times I don't complain about going east :)
12 Nov 10:49 - Martha: Sarcastic robot wins it.
12 Nov 10:50 - Owen: Marthican't more like! Amiright folks!?
12 Nov 10:50 - Owen: üêõ
12 Nov 10:51 - Sam Roberts: Could've done with subtitles
12 Nov 10:52 - Martha: I just realised: you know that film 'contact' I said it was quite like? Matthew mcconnorghdkdkd was in that too.
12 Nov 10:52 - Sam Roberts: I liked the barbican centre though, felt like we were running through a Kafka novel to get there
12 Nov 10:52 - Martha: Yes to subtitles, then we might have been able to understand over bun's rustling.
12 Nov 10:54 - Sam Roberts: Hahaha I'd forgotten that! Full points for rustling bunny!
12 Nov 11:30 - Alex Bunn: Shouldve munched during re-entry
12 Nov 11:31 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: Or during one of those organ solos

12 Nov 11:33 - Joe Jarman: I want to go today üòÑ

13 Nov 08:09 - Owen: Wow. Isn't it ironic than palindnilap is also a palindnilap.
13 Nov 08:21 - Hannah Murphy: There are 2 types of people in the world. Those who can extrapolate from incomplete data.

13 Nov 13:10 - Tegan: All amazing
13 Nov 13:10 - Tegan: Though I like 26 a lot
13 Nov 13:29 - Tegan: Why not test your memory with the 'Richard Madeley or Alan Partridge' quiz?
13 Nov 13:29 - Tegan: http://i100.independent.co.uk/article/who-said-it-richard-madeley-or-alan-partridge--ekEJrmQ5Pg
13 Nov 14:23 - Bongo: Is anyone else reading those quotes in an alan partridge voice?
14 Nov 11:08 - Hannah Murphy: Is it your last day at ocado mike?
14 Nov 11:08 - Hannah Murphy: What havoc are you going to wreak? Woooo! Celebrations
14 Nov 11:10 - Lorna: Delete all the data
14 Nov 11:11 - Joe Jarman: Forward all orders to tesco
14 Nov 11:11 - Tegan: That would be impish
14 Nov 11:14 - Owen: Damn that was a horde analysis anyway. My üê≤s were worthless there
14 Nov 11:14 - Owen: I would like back onto nergasm though mike... i promise not to üê≤ anymore
14 Nov 11:14 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: <Media omitted>
14 Nov 11:14 - Tegan: I think Mike also counts each consecutive Newgate from one person as one message
14 Nov 11:15 - Tegan: So you need to be more strategic
14 Nov 11:15 - Tegan: Nice
14 Nov 11:18 - Hannah Murphy: Impish!
14 Nov 11:18 - Hannah Murphy: Great word teegZ
14 Nov 11:19 - Owen: So i just need to insert a üê≤
14 Nov 11:19 - Owen: Every time someone else says something?

14 Nov 11:19 - Tegan: Use it well
14 Nov 11:20 - Owen: Me? üê≤
14 Nov 11:22 - Alex Bunn: Ocado must be fucked. Som many people in Mikes team have handed in their notice since he dis
14 Nov 11:23 - Owen: Dis....
14 Nov 11:23 - Owen: Dont leave us hanging.
14 Nov 11:24 - Owen: OP will deliver....?
14 Nov 11:33 - Sam Roberts: *did. I wonder if text typos are improving humanity's lateral thinking. It's like every fifth message is a little logic puzzle
14 Nov 11:35 - Owen: I was thinking 'disappeared'
14 Nov 11:42 - Dan Sluckin: ...membered 12 people in that incident.
14 Nov 11:45 - Owen: He didn't quit, he was committed to a mental asylum after all that dismembering.
14 Nov 11:48 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: Yeah 5 out of 9 people from my team handed in their notice in the last month
14 Nov 11:48 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: <Media omitted>
14 Nov 11:48 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: On the other hand, the Ocado share price rallied like the day after I resigned
14 Nov 11:49 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: Lol
14 Nov 11:53 - Sam Roberts: 'stock prices rose dramatically on the news that Mike Jones, the infamous data analyst, was leaving the company'
14 Nov 11:55 - Owen: "Shareholders held a massive party with thier increased dividends. There were rumours of a 'mike effigy' being burned and beaten."
14 Nov 11:58 - Owen: "Mike jones is now being employed as simultaneous head of both barcleys and RBS"
14 Nov 12:07 - Tegan: Lol
14 Nov 12:11 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: <Media omitted>
14 Nov 12:17 - Joe Jarman: That's some damn fine data science
14 Nov 12:18 - Joe Jarman: Shaggy needs to be careful because someone likes.McDonald's too much
14 Nov 12:18 - Tegan: Exemplary. Did you see mike's last horde analysis?
14 Nov 12:18 - Owen: Sam better be careful because someone likes italians too much.
14 Nov 12:19 - Tegan: (The idea that that is shaggy's problem is more than gently misogynistic)
14 Nov 12:20 - Owen: Dave! Get your woman back in line. She is talking out of turn!
14 Nov 12:22 - Tegan: Looking for an emoji to express my feminist vitriol...
14 Nov 12:22 - Krizia: Hahaha

14 Nov 12:25 - Tegan: Could be a girl
14 Nov 12:25 - Owen: Colonial lion hunter
14 Nov 12:29 - Tegan: Look how sad and confused she looks when she's not getting her hair cut or getting married
14 Nov 12:29 - Tegan: Poor emoji lady
14 Nov 12:29 - Owen: Dont forget how happy she is when dancing with another lady wearing a swimsuit and bunny ears.
