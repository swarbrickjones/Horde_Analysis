knowledge of marketing is say anywhere between days and a week.should've done it at the event then.ahh can't you try to get them to do it at the event.does it involve money.send them an email straight after then as just a thanks for coming email.but with a subtle give me all your money at the end.straight after the event.my days answer earlier was assuming you'd already bugged them at the event.np as with most of my advice i take no responsibility for the outcome.like my advice to shaggy to keep on drinking when he clearly shouldn't have kept on drinking ah dude i've broken the sugar thing hard lately two words fizzy laces.woohoo game of thrones what time are we barbying.but there's not enough time to marinade i'll improvise.egg fried between two half cooked pork chops is always a good fall

garlic.ok we can make it in c town then i smashed the interview it's a pretty drawn out one though two more rounds more people to see.no mostly experience questions.then all of sudden random programming questions i had to write on paper lol i've heard some really stupid answers to that question that's nowhere near as bad as some of them.someone said i start hearing a voice in my head when i get stressed telling me what to do not in an interview i was in but that's still extremely creepy.haha yea nailed it well done chap now er burn that chair.yea i've never asked it i usually ask something along the lines of if i were to suggest getting wasted for the next hour what would you do.that only gets half marks the correct answer is the sound of a beer being opened.i have the chops btw owen if you're good to make the bbq sauce.haha yea that was thoroughly meaty and game of thronesy.cheers guys i put a lot of love into that marinade.cheers my creative humour knows no limits.no it's not i'm actually having a really nice day.i lol'd.reducing the deficit should be one of the highest priorities though.jobs and the economy are affected by the deficit though.we can choose to ignore it and later down the line pay for it massively.or deal with it now at the expense of other things yea but that trade off unfortunately works in the deficit reduction's favour because we are so massively in debt interest on our debt is huge reducing it by a linear about is saving us much much more than spending a linear amount on anything.tax rise if everyone on the country agrees that removing debt is the best option in.but you don't want people to move out of the country to avoid tax.people moving out of the country to avoid tax.big companies already avoid tax by moving out often he country.the grey area where startups are starting up in the uk could easily just move to other countries.yea let's just do that.can we start our own country somewhere hotter than england.no one wants to cut public spending.well that's just silly.become a contractor.our deficit last year in total was bln so just that one year of paying would have wiped the slate clean.but given that it's accumulating at such a high rate and the interest accruing on top of that just one year of paying it all back would be amazing.nothing improves productivity like another war let's go invade someone.i think we'd get screwed over by russia personally it's pretty much straight sailing between them and us.gdp is a bit of a useless stat though right.it's a ridiculously old one that needs updating i'd give a medal to anyone who can give a number to a country's output.holy crap it's hot i'm roasting like crispy duck.oh nice has it just opened i'd be up for that.shoreditch covent garden one you can

subliminal messages.climbing first then game on.nooo just finished up sam and i are heading to the pub for pie if anyone wants to join.wunderbaa.awesome.it's a conspiracy to hide the fact that the mongols wiped out what is currently known as western europe.yea contractors get auto uninvited to everything.incompetent contractors don't count.go contracting tegs.lol that quote i'm in a similar workspace filled with silly quotes.worst one is probably winning means you're willing to go longer work longer and give more than anyone else vince lombardi.i'm in the royal exchange.it's this transition consultancy near bank.i got hooked up through gs.put ketamine in the coffee jar..i concur also have you been messing around with autocorrect again shag pig the dog interviews scarlett

interview days where i'll either be crying or suicidal.that was a quick turnaround.i've only just noticed the asian emoji that's so mega racist.it's the slanted eyes that makes it racist though also where's the black emoji i bet they were like okay so for the other races we have a different skin colour and something distinguishable about the race so what distinguishing feature about black people should we include on the emoji.ah they hate black people more than anyone.that makes marginally less racist but what about.and i feel is misrepresenting pesos everywhere.pedos the eyes are narrowed you have to look real close.plus the cap is a traditional chinese hat.that's definitely a possibility squinting tourist although that's rather specific for an emoji.if they have squinting tourist why the hell don't that have asian people.yea looks the same to me.do you have an iphone.top right button and centre circle button at the same time.wtf.lol wait a second yea lol.your asian dude doesn't have slanted eyes as well.it is very philosophic maybe in real life some people don't see black people but an asian dude with an alien standing next to him.that would explain a lot of the racial hate that's been going on.don't worry it's a thumbs up and an alien.lol i'd pay to see that.surely that's just a mini bloody mary i'm up for that.pretty much all the options are going to be about drinking right how about designated driver downs pints or everyone with their first name starting with the person who spun the wheel takes a shot oh wait these are meant to be rewarding for the person spinning.that's more of a five quid wheel than two.spinner has to become a leader of a cult and sacrifice and overthrow any government of their choosing.sounds cool is it a mobile app or web app.we

the news grinning in a pub somewhere.nigel just compared this election to the last one where he was intensive care after a plan crash lol.that's scraping the barrel for optimism.congrats dude sounds like an awesome opportunity.hear hear owen shameless propaganda leading up to the election campaign adverts that imply things that completely contradict the party's policies but it's always been like that political leaders are becoming like zaphod beeblebrox.it works in small groups with common principles like the horde can we just go live on a mountainside somewhere and leave all of this.but we'll call it bongdom.lol you were just happy no particular buffoonery.you were very close to arguing with the bouncers for not being able to take our drink out of the club though.yea it's cool though

spirit.museum of computing ay.good analysis wills i was going to say he's trying really hard to play a miniature piano up rios bum.nah don't think so they're only cheaper if they're crap.charging less for how long it's been out would be admitting that it's value deteriorates over time which is probably only true just after release but it would make it seem that way past the release so they probably just want to market it as all of our movies are timeless also it might convince people who were already going to see it straight away that they should wait until it gets cheaper.that would still make it better than any of the sequels.they're they're they're learning.does it have a scene where they hack into the mainframe to save the day.by a girl who learnt how to hack from microsoft excel training.lol that's not nature finding a way that's man making the most of a situation when he's inbetween two female parts.amazing i always like to think animals are way more intelligent than us and
