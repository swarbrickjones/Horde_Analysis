5 Aug 2014 20:46 - Sam Roberts: Anyone watching the debate? I need to educate myself!
5 Aug 2014 20:51 - Tegan: Can you record it? Does that still happen?
5 Aug 2014 20:51 - Angela: What debate is this?
5 Aug 2014 20:52 - Tegan: Or could iplayer it later in the week?  Would be happy to join you to yaahboo at Alex Salmond
5 Aug 2014 20:52 - Dave: The summary is that salmond will say lots of optimistic things and darling will say lots of pessimistic things (despite his name).
5 Aug 2014 20:52 - Dave: It will be unclear who is right
5 Aug 2014 20:53 - Dave: End result will depend on whether you are optimistic or not
6 Aug 2014 12:35 - Sam Roberts: Good debate, felt a lot more like opinions backed by facts, and less like rabble rousing rhetoric than I was expecting
6 Aug 2014 12:35 - Sam Roberts: Just saw this a week, guess who made their own outfit from a bin bag

8 Aug 2014 10:24 - Alex Bunn: Lol
8 Aug 2014 10:42 - Tegan: Yaaaay!
8 Aug 2014 10:43 - Angela: He's dead now.
8 Aug 2014 10:48 - Shaggy: Because you ate him?
8 Aug 2014 11:00 - Angela: Yeah, poor little guy didn't stand a chance
8 Aug 2014 11:01 - Angela: Far too tasty looking
8 Aug 2014 11:19 - Alex Bunn: Thats what gets for being sad/happy on a friday
8 Aug 2014 11:33 - Krizia: Hahahaha happyyy üéäüéäÓåíÓåí Friday!!!
8 Aug 2014 11:33 - Krizia: I don't want to get eaten ;)
8 Aug 2014 14:45 - Shaggy: Someone died from e cigarette exploding, they are bound to make them illegal now
8 Aug 2014 14:46 - Henry Dranks: laaame I love my ecig
8 Aug 2014 14:46 - Tegan: A few people have set on fire already
8 Aug 2014 14:47 - Tegan: I imagine it will be hard to stop people ordering them from China,  which is where they all seem to come from anyway
8 Aug 2014 14:47 - Henry Dranks: tbh mine gets really sodding hot im not surprised theyre combusting
8 Aug 2014 14:48 - Angela: Technically he was killed by his oxygen tank exploding
8 Aug 2014 14:48 - Angela: Set off by the eecigarette
8 Aug 2014 14:48 - Tegan: Was he under water?
8 Aug 2014 14:48 - Angela: So you're probably ok unless you're carting one of those around, in which case you're not that ok to begin with
8 Aug 2014 14:48 - Shaggy: That's circumstantial, e cigarettes are the real #terrorists here
8 Aug 2014 14:49 - Angela: I'm guessing he had some kind of smoking related illness - how ironic
8 Aug 2014 14:50 - Shaggy: To have lung cancer and die from explosion?
8 Aug 2014 14:50 - Shaggy: At least he can laugh in the face of cancer
8 Aug 2014 14:51 - Henry Dranks: id rather die explosively than cancerously tbh
8 Aug 2014 14:51 - Shaggy: That's ambiguous. Explosive diarrhoea is not a nice way to go
8 Aug 2014 14:53 - Henry Dranks: depends just how explosive surely. I mean, if your digestive system straight up vaporises you it wouldnt be too bad
8 Aug 2014 14:53 - Angela: It'd be bad for whoever finds you
8 Aug 2014 14:54 - Angela: Vaporised by poo
8 Aug 2014 15:16 - Tegan: Ye gods
8 Aug 2014 15:16 - Tegan: Is it possible?
8 Aug 2014 15:46 - Shaggy: Yup, lookup pooverization
8 Aug 2014 15:47 - Shaggy: In fact this is where the word poverty is desired from, literally meaning bathing in own shit
8 Aug 2014 15:49 - Henry Dranks: haha pooverisation love it
8 Aug 2014 15:49 - Henry Dranks: not to be confused with hooverisation, wherein the victim is slowly pulled inside a dyson
8 Aug 2014 15:55 - Shaggy: If anyone is interested in etymology, the term was invented by dyson on Hoover dam, and has nothing to do with hoovers, which are not powerful enough for that particular form of homicide
8 Aug 2014 15:55 - Tegan: Or shoeverisation, where the victim is beaten to death with his own shoes...
8 Aug 2014 15:55 - Tegan: Good Fridaying, everyone x
8 Aug 2014 16:03 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: Lol
8 Aug 2014 16:03 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: Poo

19 Aug 2014 16:25 - Bongo: I'm hoping he's used to people not being able to keep a straight face while talking to him
19 Aug 2014 16:36 - Tegan: Why indeed?
19 Aug 2014 16:36 - Tegan: Tee hee hee

19 Aug 2014 17:49 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: First name Wing
19 Aug 2014 17:59 - Sam Roberts: My sister had a school friend called Richard Dicks. I guess his parents were just bad people
19 Aug 2014 18:03 - Lorna: Two mathematicians I know: dong Wang and jumbo wang
19 Aug 2014 18:05 - Lorna: There should be a support group for people whose names mean penis
19 Aug 2014 18:07 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: You can't not succeed in life with a name like Jumbo Wang
19 Aug 2014 18:09 - Hannah Murphy: A lot of pressure on you in the bedroom I would expect
19 Aug 2014 18:09 - Hannah Murphy: Stressful
19 Aug 2014 18:09 - Sam Roberts: It's a big name to live up to
19 Aug 2014 18:23 - Alex Bunn: Now thats a name i couldnt restrain myself from laughing at

19 Aug 2014 19:08 - Angela: Thai has a letter in between d and t, which is used for tom yum soup. So it's a bit different
19 Aug 2014 19:32 - Owen: I teach a kid called dong hung. I bet he doesn't get picked on because he can always use the "dong hung by name dong hung by nature" comeback.

20 Aug 2014 16:33 - Phil: Does the ladies triathlon include mud wrestling instead of biking?
20 Aug 2014 16:44 - Tegan: Is that distance mud wrestling?
20 Aug 2014 16:57 - Sam Roberts: With a strict 2 items or less policy on clothing
20 Aug 2014 16:58 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: I would choose kigu
20 Aug 2014 16:58 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: And another kigu to go on top of that kigu

20 Aug 2014 17:00 - Sam Roberts: But that's why you'll never win the Seattle women's triathlon
20 Aug 2014 17:01 - Tegan: You could sell that kigu, no question
20 Aug 2014 17:01 - Tegan: Maybe big data ain't your game

1 Sep 2014 18:49 - Shaggy: If you like turkish cuisine I strongly recommend tas, it's pretty cheap and mighty tasty. If you want tapas then brindisa is really good, it's moderately priced. If you want a more pub-like atmosphere the George has excellent chefs too
1 Sep 2014 19:41 - Lora: Brindisa is expensive and always too crowded, long wait. I always love me a good vapiano!
1 Sep 2014 22:58 - Bongo: I thought you said it was Friday henners, or is that something else

5 Sep 2014 20:39 - Dan Sluckin: That's what SHE said.
5 Sep 2014 20:40 - Owen: I believe bongo was relaying the information that a fine gangsta named shorty is able to fire a shot gun proficiently but only if he is in less affluent neighbourhoods.
5 Sep 2014 20:41 - Dan Sluckin: (After the 'incident')
5 Sep 2014 20:50 - Tegan: Thank you Owen

5 Sep 2014 20:57 - Krizia: <Media omitted>
5 Sep 2014 21:25 - Owen: I am a slow loris
I live in a forest
Eating bugs makes my day
Detroit what'd ya say?
5 Sep 2014 21:26 - Owen: I pull out my gat
And with a ratatat tat
Five slugs in your belly
Makes tupac jelly.
5 Sep 2014 21:30 - Owen: When I left compton town
The crime rate went down
Like sam's mom on peter kay
Thats g life; O-K?
5 Sep 2014 21:30 - Shaggy: Not bad
5 Sep 2014 21:31 - Shaggy: For a five year old dive dwelling chive favouring slum child
5 Sep 2014 21:32 - Tegan: Lol

5 Sep 2014 21:32 - Tegan: Nice rhymes, o
5 Sep 2014 21:33 - Tegan: Where did V go?
5 Sep 2014 21:37 - Owen: Let's have a word for Mike swarbrick.
He wears the badge of a law dick.
Takes names: 'your nicked'
His mom takes the dicks of four tricks!
5 Sep 2014 21:39 - Tegan: Niiiiiice intro
5 Sep 2014 21:48 - Owen: Whatup tegan palmer
Voice like a farmer.
Herder of llama.
Wearer of armour.

Yeah I know, that's not so good.
But it ain't bad for a guy from the hood.
I'll stop and continue you should.
While I pause and eat my pud.
5 Sep 2014 21:52 - Dan Sluckin: O, your rhymes are so reckless,
We'll show you up as a ludicrous,
feckless, slow loris.
Less ability than Boris...
Johnson at rapping,
caught you napping, prattling
about other's mothers,
but yours ain't getting no thinner,
Time to shut up and eat your dinner.
5 Sep 2014 21:53 - Shaggy: I like your rhymes but they're not quite mature, think for a bit and then when you're sure hit back, with rhyme that ain't whack, rhyme that will make me take smack, rhyme that will me take crack, crack my back, whack the smack and all that, sure
5 Sep 2014 21:53 - Owen: Reckless and ludicrous rhyme in no way at all.

Other than that.  It was pretty good.
5 Sep 2014 21:55 - Shaggy: Dan your rhymes rule, you've studied the school of cool, they literally make drool. You ain't no fool! Like poor O
5 Sep 2014 22:04 - Dan Sluckin: I don't need no rhyming dictionary using critic,
The links and perfect timing, work when I just hit it.
If you read the flow like my man Shaggage
You'll find no space for baggage:
Ludicrous, said like the rapper, entrepreneur and actor
rhymes with reckless and is a determining factor,
In your freestyling downfall,
Your mind is so small,
I await your next reply, so
Alex Trofymenko,
Can just show
How its done yo.
5 Sep 2014 22:04 - Dan Sluckin: Or alternatively teegz
Because I just want to play leagues...
5 Sep 2014 22:14 - Owen: Ok I guess I have to play leagues now. That was excellent.
5 Sep 2014 22:15 - Shaggy added Adimina

12 Sep 2014 12:57 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: TIL: George Foreman has 5 sons called George, George, George, George and George
12 Sep 2014 12:57 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: And a daughter called Georgetta
12 Sep 2014 13:00 - Sam Roberts: That's nuts
12 Sep 2014 13:00 - Sam Roberts: And a great Wikipedia read
12 Sep 2014 13:01 - Joe Jarman: Must get confusing at Christmas
12 Sep 2014 13:01 - Joe Jarman: Do they have nicknames
12 Sep 2014 13:02 - Joe Jarman: I bet he just gets them all an updated version of his grill anyway
12 Sep 2014 13:09 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: Lol
12 Sep 2014 13:11 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: I like that he turned down Georgia, Georgie, Georgina for Georgetta!

12 Sep 2014 13:13 - Tegan: Roman numerals are always a stately option

12 Sep 2014 13:34 - Angela: Maybe he's just passing on his greatest legacy. The name of an amazing piece of kitchenware. Being called george Forman must open a lot of doors in life
12 Sep 2014 13:35 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: His sons should change the name to George Fiveman
12 Sep 2014 13:43 - Sam Roberts: Would you rather fight one George Fiveman sized George Foreman, or four George Foreman sized George Fivemans?

12 Sep 2014 14:32 - Joe Jarman: Does grandmaster flash have to be a page they've liked?
12 Sep 2014 14:33 - Hannah Murphy: Nah it's just started making any old suggestions closest to what you're writing
12 Sep 2014 14:33 - Hannah Murphy: Or perhaps old nana's just love the flashster
12 Sep 2014 14:35 - Alex Bunn: Maybe thats what old people are calling themselves these days

13 Sep 2014 19:23 - Tegan: Thanks for all the hard work, guys :)
13 Sep 2014 19:24 - Tegan: Wellcome is sweet, the exhibition is small, but the permanent exhibition is also worth a look
13 Sep 2014 19:25 - Tegan: In the vacinity of the cider tap aswell, which is a home away from home for a West Country man
13 Sep 2014 19:50 - Sam Roberts: Cider specific? The Roberts clan has never been too apple-centric
13 Sep 2014 19:51 - Sam Roberts: Top tip though, cheers
13 Sep 2014 19:52 - Dave: It's all cider but it has a beery brother over the road
13 Sep 2014 19:54 - Sam Roberts: Sounds like a winning recipe for a powerful hangover, can't wait
13 Sep 2014 19:58 - Tegan: The beer version is the Euston tap- it's much busier, with much more liklihood of having to stand on the pavement
13 Sep 2014 20:15 - Tegan: <Media omitted>
13 Sep 2014 20:15 - Tegan: Eric Cantona. 1987
13 Sep 2014 21:46 - Angela: Rocking a Burberry hat too, years ahead of the curve
13 Sep 2014 21:47 - Tegan: Looking every inch the hero
14 Sep 2014 05:57 - Adimina: <Media omitted>
14 Sep 2014 05:57 - Adimina: Fischmarkt
14 Sep 2014 10:01 - Vanessa: Sorry guys brunch is postponed today
14 Sep 2014 10:33 - Bongo: Lol that looks tasty
14 Sep 2014 10:47 - Adimina: At 6:30 it was amazeballs
14 Sep 2014 10:57 - Tegan: Mmmmm
14 Sep 2014 10:58 - Tegan: Shall we do something else instead of brunch?
14 Sep 2014 11:01 - Joe Jarman: Fry up
14 Sep 2014 14:09 - Tegan: The time for fry ups may have passed
14 Sep 2014 14:09 - Tegan: But if anyone fancies coming round for a beer and a board game you'd be more than welcome
14 Sep 2014 14:32 - Tegan: Or out for a roast later?
14 Sep 2014 14:32 - Tegan: Options
14 Sep 2014 14:34 - Joe Jarman: Flint knapping in stoke Newington is an option
14 Sep 2014 14:52 - Lorna: I was going to head to the old blue last later on, for some jazzy live music. Its free, and round the corner (from me at least)
14 Sep 2014 14:57 - Tegan: Both sound intriguing
14 Sep 2014 14:57 - Tegan: Will you be stripping out the copper as well, Joe?
14 Sep 2014 16:54 - Tegan: (Have since looked up what flint knapping is- looks like fun)
14 Sep 2014 18:24 - Joe Jarman: I know I'm gutted I didn't attend
15 Sep 2014 15:49 - Alex Bunn: <Media omitted>
15 Sep 2014 15:49 - Alex Bunn: <Media omitted>
15 Sep 2014 16:32 - Tegan: Where's the second one from?
15 Sep 2014 16:35 - Alex Bunn: Google extrafabulouscomics
15 Sep 2014 16:52 - Adimina: Yo c town. I'm back from Hamburg today to take Phil's bed. Who is home when?
15 Sep 2014 16:53 - Sam Roberts: Wooo! I'll be around about 6.30, we were just discussing making a pie, in?
15 Sep 2014 16:55 - Alex Bunn: Yeah back around 6.30ish
15 Sep 2014 16:55 - Alex Bunn: Bring wine
15 Sep 2014 16:55 - Adimina: It's meat-free Monday so if it's a veggie pie then yes
15 Sep 2014 16:56 - Adimina: I got y'all a postcard. Here's a sneak peek
15 Sep 2014 16:56 - Alex Bunn: Afraid it has several types of meat
15 Sep 2014 16:57 - Adimina: <Media omitted>
15 Sep 2014 16:57 - Sam Roberts: That's a man
15 Sep 2014 16:58 - Adimina: Hehehe
15 Sep 2014 16:58 - Alex Bunn: Manish ankles
15 Sep 2014 16:58 - Alex Bunn: Mankles
15 Sep 2014 16:58 - Adimina: I'll getting some set duty free booze
15 Sep 2014 16:58 - Adimina: *sweet
15 Sep 2014 17:08 - Adimina: And by "boarding soon" I mean "my plane is on another city and delayed an hour"
15 Sep 2014 20:55 - Adimina: ÓÄùÓÄéÓÑº
15 Sep 2014 21:20 - Alex Bunn: Have you got to London yet?
15 Sep 2014 21:20 - Adimina: On the train to blackfriars now
15 Sep 2014 22:43 - Adimina: Coming from star lane now. Get the shot glasses ready boys. Tuesday boozeday
16 Sep 2014 13:28 - Tegan: Anyone want to come try out the climbing wall at mile end this evening?
16 Sep 2014 13:29 - Sam Roberts: Hmm could do, they've got a great overhang room there
16 Sep 2014 13:29 - Sam Roberts: I think it gets busier though, let me see if dreas is up for it
16 Sep 2014 13:31 - Adimina: What time ya thinking?
16 Sep 2014 13:31 - Tegan: 7ish?
16 Sep 2014 13:32 - Adimina: Ah, gotta be in North London for 8 so I'll pass. But keen for a cling sometime
16 Sep 2014 17:27 - Sam Roberts: Going to the usual place just now, if you fancy a Bermondsey climb I'll be there in 30 mins or so
16 Sep 2014 19:18 - Adimina: Do I got a bit excited and tie dyed a dress... So of anyone needs to dye anything green our blue there is some outside... I'll be back later tonight to dispose of it if not
16 Sep 2014 20:17 - Sam Roberts: Let's tie dye all Bunns pants, he loves hippy stuff like that
16 Sep 2014 20:18 - Adimina: Or his work shirts?
16 Sep 2014 20:18 - Sam Roberts: Even better! He's in the green division, guaranteed promotion
16 Sep 2014 20:28 - Dave: Don't forget his hats...he hates that they're not all green
16 Sep 2014 20:32 - Adimina: Oh, and his undies
16 Sep 2014 20:33 - Dave: You always have to turn a serious conversation into something silly don't you...
16 Sep 2014 20:36 - Adimina: I am dead serious. If Bunn doesn't have all green undies then he's not a real man
16 Sep 2014 20:37 - Dave: Well as long as you're serious! Shame you don't have yellow dye, could get a teenage mutant teenage turtle theme going
16 Sep 2014 20:38 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: Wait, do you mean this?
16 Sep 2014 20:38 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: <Media omitted>

17 Sep 2014 13:51 - Krizia: ÓÑÖ
17 Sep 2014 13:52 - Sam Roberts: I've been lied to! The color run started as a holi thing, but this one isn't on holi which is always in spring
17 Sep 2014 13:52 - Sam Roberts: Good comparative religion Bunn
17 Sep 2014 13:53 - Alex Bunn: I remember holi was just after we left india in feb

17 Sep 2014 15:47 - Bongo: Also up for the colour run
17 Sep 2014 15:48 - Krizia: She is gorgeous!!! to not say one of the most beautiful people I know! !
17 Sep 2014 15:49 - Krizia: She is a musical actress so super fun to be around
17 Sep 2014 15:50 - Owen: Well I don't know  about anyone else but that was a  good sell. I'm in. Let  us all gaze upon this beauty.
17 Sep 2014 15:58 - Krizia: Hehe he well I'm just saying we should do something fun :)
17 Sep 2014 16:08 - Adimina: ÓÄé

17 Sep 2014 18:50 - Alex Bunn: Aight
17 Sep 2014 18:50 - Alex Bunn: How long?
17 Sep 2014 18:58 - Bongo: Not sure, I'm on fleet str
17 Sep 2014 18:58 - Bongo: I might have to take a bus
17 Sep 2014 19:01 - Alex Bunn: Hmm
17 Sep 2014 19:01 - Alex Bunn: Might bail then
17 Sep 2014 19:01 - Alex Bunn: Only wanted a quick one
17 Sep 2014 19:02 - Tegan: Won't be long
17 Sep 2014 19:02 - Tegan: I've had enough of this
17 Sep 2014 19:05 - Bongo: Eta tegs?
17 Sep 2014 19:05 - Bongo: Google says I'll be 15 mins
17 Sep 2014 19:09 - Alex Bunn: Bleh üò©üò§
17 Sep 2014 19:10 - Bongo: Go home then part timer =P
17 Sep 2014 19:11 - Alex Bunn: This guy was bored and finished at 6
17 Sep 2014 19:13 - Bongo: Lol I won't blame you if you leave, I'd rather be water boarded than bored
17 Sep 2014 19:15 - Tegan: 13 minute walk from here
17 Sep 2014 19:26 - Bongo: Just got here if anyone's around
17 Sep 2014 19:27 - Bongo: The pints are on me
17 Sep 2014 19:27 - Bongo: Just like an alcoholic milkybar kid
17 Sep 2014 19:32 - Tegan: I'm outside Bong- let's enjoy this mild evening
17 Sep 2014 19:48 - Alex Bunn: Yeah i went home
17 Sep 2014 19:56 - Sam Roberts: Just tubing from Euston, the anchor still aye?
17 Sep 2014 20:21 - Bongo: Aye
17 Sep 2014 22:27 - Tegan: Owen owen owen, what was the pretty building game for phones you talked about, with the building interaction and such?
17 Sep 2014 22:39 - Owen: ?
17 Sep 2014 22:39 - Tegan: I need a game
17 Sep 2014 22:39 - Tegan: You mentioned you were playing one
17 Sep 2014 22:40 - Tegan: A building game
17 Sep 2014 22:40 - Tegan: Where rabbits interact work blueberries and the like
17 Sep 2014 22:40 - Owen: Terrestial?
17 Sep 2014 22:40 - Owen: Ohhhh
17 Sep 2014 22:40 - Owen: That's not a phone game
17 Sep 2014 22:40 - Owen: Reus.
17 Sep 2014 22:40 - Tegan: Bum
17 Sep 2014 22:40 - Owen: It's really good.
17 Sep 2014 22:40 - Tegan: I only need a phone game
17 Sep 2014 22:41 - Owen: I am learning android to make a phone game with similar ideas.
17 Sep 2014 22:41 - Owen: What kind of phone game?
17 Sep 2014 22:43 - Tegan: A building game
17 Sep 2014 22:43 - Tegan: With pretty
17 Sep 2014 22:43 - Tegan: All crowd sourced suggestions welcome
17 Sep 2014 22:48 - Sam Roberts: Terraria. Best game ever
17 Sep 2014 23:09 - Owen: There aren't  many good phone  building  games.
17 Sep 2014 23:10 - Sam Roberts: Ooh xconstructor
17 Sep 2014 23:10 - Owen: Tiny tower was pretty addictive but it was one of those stupid wait  4 hours for something to  finish.
17 Sep 2014 23:10 - Sam Roberts: Not sure if it's on iPhone, but it's awesome
17 Sep 2014 23:10 - Owen: X constructor?
17 Sep 2014 23:10 - Owen: That sounds good. What is it?
17 Sep 2014 23:10 - Sam Roberts: I think that's it, where you build railway bridges and trains go over them
17 Sep 2014 23:11 - Sam Roberts: But if you build them badly, everyone dies
17 Sep 2014 23:18 - Owen: Nice
17 Sep 2014 23:34 - Joe Jarman: Hey Owen how good with android are you
17 Sep 2014 23:34 - Joe Jarman: I'm starting a coursesa course in a few days
17 Sep 2014 23:35 - Joe Jarman: Looking for others interested
17 Sep 2014 23:35 - Joe Jarman: Also I've been messing about with unity as well
18 Sep 2014 00:24 - Owen: I'm about 1/4 of the way through my book. I have got the basics and am now using fragments. It's a pretty neat setup. Very scalable, but that means that you have to do quite a lot for even the simplest app. Fortunately android released a development  kit pre bundled with eclipse which takes away loads of the legwork  that existed when android was first  released. I haven't  looked into unity, mainly because I don't have an apple. What's  it like?
18 Sep 2014 09:01 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: What's the predictions for Scotland vote then?
18 Sep 2014 09:02 - Angela: I think it'll be a no, what do you think?
18 Sep 2014 09:02 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: I reckon no too, morbidly curious to see a yes vote though...
18 Sep 2014 09:02 - Angela: I didn't think I was bothered but actually I would be a bit sad if they voted yes
18 Sep 2014 09:03 - Angela: Like being dumped by someone I completely took for granted all these years
18 Sep 2014 09:03 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: Lol
18 Sep 2014 09:03 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: And all those cyclists. Damn
18 Sep 2014 09:04 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: 55% no, that's my bet
18 Sep 2014 09:06 - Sam Roberts: Cyclists?
18 Sep 2014 09:06 - Martha: Reckon 52% no - a bit too close for comfort
18 Sep 2014 09:06 - Sam Roberts: I'm not sure I care about the really. The important thing is it sets the stage for Cornish independence, which is way overdue
18 Sep 2014 09:07 - Sam Roberts: *result
18 Sep 2014 09:07 - Sam Roberts: They actually have their own currency, take that Scotland
18 Sep 2014 09:08 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: Yeah think about all those gold medals we got in the cycling!
18 Sep 2014 09:08 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: I reckon no's are underreporting. I'd be surprised by a yes vote
18 Sep 2014 09:13 - Angela: I agree, I think 55% at least for no
18 Sep 2014 09:18 - Dave: I think I would be happy either way: excited for an independent Scotland, content to see an island united.
18 Sep 2014 09:20 - Dave: The underreporting point is true though the polls may not be very reliable. There was a chap from yougov on the radio the other day saying that polls are usually weighted to control for the way they are sampled however this process requires historical data
18 Sep 2014 09:20 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: There's no exit polls! Bullshit, where's the fun in that?
18 Sep 2014 09:20 - Dave: There isn't any such data for this referendum but the weighting process has been done anyway which can skew the results
18 Sep 2014 09:24 - Joe Jarman: Ungrateful Scots costing us a fortune yes or no, best just to cull the lot of em. Off to collect my dole money ÓêÖ
18 Sep 2014 09:25 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: You know betfair have already paid out on no? Thats pretty cocky...
18 Sep 2014 09:26 - Angela: While they weight the results for sampling, they can't weight them for people lying. All the polls in 1992 predicted a labour win but it turned out that voting conservative was so uncool that people just didn't want to admit to it
18 Sep 2014 09:26 - Dave: What happens if it's yes? Do they have to return the money?
18 Sep 2014 09:27 - Angela: Probably voting no is seen as boring but actually people do want the safer option?
18 Sep 2014 09:28 - Alex Bunn: I'm for a yes vote
18 Sep 2014 09:28 - Dave: Maybe, bit I wonder how many people, when in the ballot box, will let the excitement take over and change to yes
18 Sep 2014 09:28 - Alex Bunn: I bet they could have a more progressive country if they cut London loose
18 Sep 2014 09:31 - Alex Bunn: Great Britain is renamed, not-so-great-anymore Britain
18 Sep 2014 09:32 - Krizia: I think the contrary actually happens in the ballot box a lot of people take the safe option or they change right there!
18 Sep 2014 09:32 - Alex Bunn: Not-as-united as before Kindom
18 Sep 2014 09:33 - Krizia: I can't wait for this to be over! !! its boring at work all is Scott here there! ! Common
18 Sep 2014 09:43 - Sam Roberts: They'll all be deported tomorrow, it'll be a lonely Friday for you!
18 Sep 2014 09:49 - Krizia: Hehe well if I had a vote I would say yes!!! Let's start a revolution just for the sake of it!!
18 Sep 2014 09:54 - Alex Bunn: Thats the spirit!
18 Sep 2014 09:56 - Dave: Yay!
18 Sep 2014 09:57 - Adimina: If the Scots leave then soon enough we'll have Wales and the rest of Ireland jumping ship too
18 Sep 2014 09:57 - Adimina: Then well just be "Britain"
18 Sep 2014 09:57 - Alex Bunn: Wales and Ireland dont have any oil
18 Sep 2014 09:59 - Alex Bunn: But i would quite like to see Wales go it alone
18 Sep 2014 09:59 - Alex Bunn: They could export loveliness
18 Sep 2014 10:05 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: Let's have a London referendum! Fuck everyone else!
18 Sep 2014 10:05 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: Except Hatfield
18 Sep 2014 10:07 - Owen: I hope it is a yes. That would be an awesome experiment.
18 Sep 2014 10:08 - Owen: One that we can observe but that really doesn't  affect us much.
18 Sep 2014 10:08 - Sam Roberts: Whisky prices will go up
18 Sep 2014 10:08 - Sam Roberts: It's the only effect on my life I can think of
18 Sep 2014 10:11 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: Gold medals in cycling will plummet
18 Sep 2014 10:11 - Vanessa: England is starting to produce some good whiskey
18 Sep 2014 10:11 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: People keep ignoring the big issues
18 Sep 2014 10:12 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: Do we still get to claim someone from the uk won Wimbledon?
18 Sep 2014 10:12 - Owen: Will they? That depends on  a lot of factors: Import  and export tax between England and Scotland, whether the new scoring government  decides to subsidise whiskey, EU trade rules.
18 Sep 2014 10:14 - Sam Roberts: It won't go down
18 Sep 2014 10:14 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: It also depends on whether we decide to put Hadrian's wall back up
18 Sep 2014 10:14 - Sam Roberts: We're only losing Hoy, and without the superior british bikes and training, he'll dwindle to a hollowed has been
18 Sep 2014 10:21 - Alex Bunn: He'll dwindle to a hollowed has been anyway
18 Sep 2014 10:21 - Alex Bunn: Ha!
18 Sep 2014 10:21 - Alex Bunn: Ageing
18 Sep 2014 10:22 - Alex Bunn: I think claiming Andy Murray as our own has been a gigantic push for Scottish independence
18 Sep 2014 10:24 - Owen: It could go down sam. It is a big industry. Wouldn't be suprised if a Scotland in charge of thier own economy decide to subsidise it loads. That coupled with EU trade laws would mean no export tax to Britain.
18 Sep 2014 10:25 - Owen: France subsidise thier wine industry considerably.

24 Sep 2014 18:15 - Adimina: I just got this message now that I'm home... I think I'll go kickboxing instead. Btw I found a fourth team member for colour run
24 Sep 2014 19:13 - Dave: Is everyone still out?
24 Sep 2014 19:13 - Dave: I just finished a 4.5 hour interview and need a drink.

24 Sep 2014 21:45 - Sam Roberts: Trees!
24 Sep 2014 21:45 - Sam Roberts: Yees!

25 Sep 2014 06:45 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: <Media omitted>
25 Sep 2014 10:18 - Adimina: Hey c-towners. Where is this cheap racist hairdresser I can go to for a short back and sides
25 Sep 2014 10:19 - Shaggy: I think you should grow a mullet
25 Sep 2014 10:23 - Adimina: That is an option...
25 Sep 2014 10:49 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: Peter's. He may also be sexist in which case you'll have to pretend to be a guy
25 Sep 2014 10:50 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: He's really crap btw, I just go there out of habit now
25 Sep 2014 10:54 - Adimina: Haha... I do look a bit like a boy
25 Sep 2014 10:54 - Adimina: How can you mess up short back and sides though?
25 Sep 2014 10:56 - Owen: By doing long back and sides instead.
25 Sep 2014 10:56 - Owen: Like a monk.
25 Sep 2014 11:00 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: One time he forgot to cut one of the sides, and I had to remind him
25 Sep 2014 11:03 - Adimina: Hahaha
25 Sep 2014 11:03 - Tegan: Lol
25 Sep 2014 11:28 - Owen: A kid just dislocated his knee. On my break duty!
25 Sep 2014 11:38 - Vanessa: Just pop it in place
25 Sep 2014 11:38 - Owen: Instructions unclear. Now he has two dislocated knees.
25 Sep 2014 11:39 - Vanessa: Now you can call for an ambulance
25 Sep 2014 11:40 - Owen: Instructions unclear. Now he has an ambulance stuck under his kneecap.
25 Sep 2014 11:45 - Shaggy: Get off your phone and help the damn kid
25 Sep 2014 11:45 - Owen: Instructions unclear. Now my phone is duct taped to his forehead!
25 Sep 2014 12:43 - Bongo: Skirt size linked to breast cancer?!
25 Sep 2014 12:44 - Bongo: I've seriously had enough of bbc news
25 Sep 2014 12:48 - Owen: Wait shorter or longer?
25 Sep 2014 12:49 - Owen: Shorter skirt size linked to breast cancer - Christian union says.

Long skirt size linked to breast cancer - playboy magazine says.
25 Sep 2014 12:49 - Owen: One might begin to question thier motivations.
25 Sep 2014 12:50 - Tegan: Ha
25 Sep 2014 12:50 - Owen: Also if it's long skirts that cause breast cancer does that mean we can stop victim blaming when a woman in a short skirt gets raped because she was just trying to protect herself from cancer.
25 Sep 2014 12:51 - Tegan: I think they mean skirt size causes cancer.
25 Sep 2014 12:55 - Owen: It's like the people who do these studies have never heard of comorbidity.
25 Sep 2014 12:55 - Angela: So if I wear jeans? No cancer?
25 Sep 2014 12:55 - Tegan: Solved!
25 Sep 2014 12:55 - Angela: Wait... Jean skirts though
25 Sep 2014 12:56 - Angela: No jean skirts
25 Sep 2014 12:56 - Dave: Which way round is the correlation? Should I wear skirts?
25 Sep 2014 12:57 - Tegan: Perhaps you should do a pamphlet
25 Sep 2014 12:57 - Tegan: But not wearing skirts doesn't stop you have a skirt size
25 Sep 2014 12:57 - Tegan: So yes dave
25 Sep 2014 12:57 - Tegan: You should
25 Sep 2014 12:57 - Joe Jarman: Why isn't it bum size linked to breast cancer
25 Sep 2014 12:58 - Owen: The skirt doesn't even cover the breasts!  How the hell would it cause them to get cancer!
25 Sep 2014 12:58 - Joe Jarman: Although I imagine there is some seriously positive correlation with bum size and boob size
25 Sep 2014 13:00 - Bongo: I reckon we should all just go naked from the waist down to avoid looking stupid
25 Sep 2014 13:02 - Joe Jarman: Naaaah waist up, nobody wants to see that bongo, put it away!
25 Sep 2014 13:04 - Owen: Wait. So a size 8 is less likely to get cancer than a size 14. Why don't they just say people who are larger are generally less healthy. The skirt thing is irrelevant!!!
25 Sep 2014 13:09 - Vanessa: I'm not sure where they got the correlation of waist size for breast cancer. But there is a definite relation between waist size and heart disease, which is not a cancer
25 Sep 2014 13:09 - Vanessa: I just read the article and it's pretty poorly written
25 Sep 2014 13:48 - Alex Bunn: Pints in the george tonight?
25 Sep 2014 13:56 - Dave: Doig! Not sure. What's the occasion?
25 Sep 2014 14:13 - Shaggy: Going to that gig in angel tonight
25 Sep 2014 14:23 - Alex Bunn: Thursday is the occassion
25 Sep 2014 15:02 - Tegan: Can't celebrate Thursday this week
25 Sep 2014 15:02 - Tegan: Enjoy it though!
25 Sep 2014 16:10 - Shaggy: Who's going to metalworks? Drinks/food beforehand?
25 Sep 2014 16:55 - Vanessa: Me
25 Sep 2014 17:04 - Sam Roberts: I am! Got me n Addy on the app yesterday
25 Sep 2014 17:06 - Vanessa: Did you receive an email?
25 Sep 2014 17:12 - Shaggy: Just because you applied doesn't mean you have the tickets
25 Sep 2014 17:52 - Sam Roberts: Pretty sure I got a thing, let me check

25 Sep 2014 18:01 - Shaggy: Don't know if it does pizza but it definitely does beer
25 Sep 2014 18:02 - Sam Roberts: Pubs called the arc, good pizza, but expensive though, there's the spoons if one fancy turns up?
25 Sep 2014 18:02 - Vanessa: I'm making my way so just let me know which one you guys decide
25 Sep 2014 18:13 - Shaggy: I'll be there in 15
25 Sep 2014 18:27 - Shaggy: I'm by the arc, it's called brewhouse now
25 Sep 2014 18:28 - Vanessa: Should be there in about 10
25 Sep 2014 18:28 - Shaggy: Or rather will be, it's being refurbished, so spoons it is
25 Sep 2014 18:31 - Sam Roberts: 'Mazing, got caught up, be there in 10
25 Sep 2014 18:37 - Vanessa: They have kraken so all is good
25 Sep 2014 18:37 - Sam Roberts: Try and get an outdoors seat, I want to smoke and drink beer
25 Sep 2014 18:38 - Adimina: What time gig starting? Kickboxing note in Camden

25 Sep 2014 19:04 - Sam Roberts: Pen

26 Sep 2014 09:01 - Martha: Montage scene. GO CATE!
26 Sep 2014 09:32 - Owen: How much is the bonus? If it is more then 300 the rational choice would be to just buy yourself a monkey (or whatever percentage of a monkey is equal to 300).
26 Sep 2014 10:04 - Z cate fuchter: Haha. The bonus is 10%. Or five monkies (?) Not sure where this cost of monkey estimate has come from Owen!
26 Sep 2014 10:07 - Adimina: üôäÓàÅüôâÓÑïüôàÓîüüòÜ
26 Sep 2014 11:03 - Owen: 10% of everything over the bonus limit? Or 10% of all your sales for the month?
26 Sep 2014 12:11 - Adimina: So I just discovered that since 2011 LOL has been formally recognized in the Oxford dictionary
26 Sep 2014 12:37 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: I like lol
26 Sep 2014 12:38 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: Its the only one of those ones that you can actually say in your head

26 Sep 2014 12:39 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: They all sound naff in your head
26 Sep 2014 12:41 - Dave: Roffle sounds good
26 Sep 2014 12:44 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: Yeah actually roffle can stay
26 Sep 2014 12:50 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: Omguh I just got cherry flavoured Pepsi instead of Pepsi flavoured Pepsi. Fummle.
26 Sep 2014 12:54 - Sam Roberts: I started saying omg like an American schoolgirl to be edgy and ironic, after a week I was just talking like an American schoolgirl
26 Sep 2014 12:57 - Adimina: I'm the same with soz. Out started out ironically, but now I genuinely mean sorry
26 Sep 2014 12:58 - Adimina: I once said soz to a dog I bumped into

28 Sep 2014 16:54 - Sam Roberts: Addy's left us some homemade burgers if you fancy one
28 Sep 2014 16:57 - Tegan: Sorry to miss this momentous occasion
28 Sep 2014 16:57 - Tegan: Needs to be a Sunday of penitence though
28 Sep 2014 16:57 - Sam Roberts: You were in our hearts
28 Sep 2014 16:58 - Sam Roberts: What happened?
28 Sep 2014 16:58 - Tegan: My parents were staying
28 Sep 2014 16:59 - Tegan: Feel like if we can't get through a weekend of moderation with them then I'm pretty much genetically screwed
28 Sep 2014 16:59 - Tegan: And I will always have to have sunday hangovers
29 Sep 2014 08:34 - Sam Roberts: Sorry to do a Hannah guys but...
29 Sep 2014 08:34 - Sam Roberts: <Media omitted>

29 Sep 2014 09:31 - Shaggy: Lol!
29 Sep 2014 09:54 - Alex Bunn: To youtube!
29 Sep 2014 10:28 - Owen: Your like Ron Swanson sam.
29 Sep 2014 10:28 - Owen: You're*
29 Sep 2014 10:49 - Adimina: So it's almost October. Anyone keen to arrange a trip to Thorpe Park Fright Nights
29 Sep 2014 10:51 - Krizia: Sam!!!! He loves the rollercoasters ;)
29 Sep 2014 10:51 - Krizia: And me!! I haven't been in a park for ages!  I always faint though
29 Sep 2014 11:04 - Sam Roberts: I've never been on a roller coaster, feels a little strange to make it to 28 and then pop my cherry
29 Sep 2014 11:06 - Dave: It'll be even stranger of you make it to 29
29 Sep 2014 11:06 - Dave: if
29 Sep 2014 11:08 - Adimina: Haha true. Even numbers are best
29 Sep 2014 12:28 - Alex Bunn: Ive never been on one of those massive ones either
29 Sep 2014 12:29 - Shaggy: That's what she said
29 Sep 2014 12:32 - Alex Bunn: <Media omitted>
29 Sep 2014 12:36 - Owen: Sam. My pension counts as an untaxed allowance correct?
29 Sep 2014 12:37 - Owen: So my taxable income is my income minus my pension.
29 Sep 2014 12:37 - Owen: And minus NI?
29 Sep 2014 12:40 - Owen: Wait. The ¬£10,000 limit before you start having to pay tax counts as an allowance.
29 Sep 2014 12:41 - Owen: ?
29 Sep 2014 12:41 - Owen: Be on lunch break already. I want answers!!
29 Sep 2014 12:44 - Owen: Never mind. I figured it out.
29 Sep 2014 12:45 - Owen: By the way. If you earn less than 41k then tax on dividends is only 10% compared to the 20% on regular savings. If you earn more than that then dividend tax is 32.5%
29 Sep 2014 12:46 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: Banter
29 Sep 2014 12:47 - Owen: Lel
29 Sep 2014 12:47 - Owen: What I just said was wrong anyway.
29 Sep 2014 12:47 - Owen: There is a 10% tax credit.
29 Sep 2014 12:48 - Owen: So if you earn below 41k you pay no tax on dividends.
29 Sep 2014 12:48 - Owen: And 22.5% if you earn more than 41k.
29 Sep 2014 12:48 - Shaggy: Yawn
29 Sep 2014 12:49 - Owen: Fine. Go invest your money somewhere stupid like up your arse!
29 Sep 2014 12:50 - Shaggy: I invest my money into beer, and my fund, read stomach, has swollen enough to show that it's a good choice
29 Sep 2014 12:51 - Tegan: Plus investment in liver cirrhosis at this stage negates the need to think about retirement plans
29 Sep 2014 12:52 - Tegan: Morbid, yet simple
29 Sep 2014 12:53 - Owen: Ok well I'm going to choose companies with a high price to earnings ratio and..... who am I kidding I'll invest in booze as well.
29 Sep 2014 12:54 - Adimina: Woo boozevestment
29 Sep 2014 12:57 - Sam Roberts: Great bant-ccountancy Owen, thanks
29 Sep 2014 12:58 - Sam Roberts: And the 10% credit means you actually get money back for getting dividend income, it's to encourage poor people to invest in the market, which I find weird on a few levels
29 Sep 2014 12:59 - Adimina: In other news. I just watched three episodes of parks and rec back to back
29 Sep 2014 12:59 - Alex Bunn: Get a job
29 Sep 2014 13:00 - Adimina: I have a job. It's called couch tuner
29 Sep 2014 13:01 - Alex Bunn: Haha. Aw man i wish i was watching parks and rec!
29 Sep 2014 13:03 - Adimina: You could be. If you quit. He he he
29 Sep 2014 13:04 - Adimina: True fact: addiction to parks and rec us the heading cause of unemployment
29 Sep 2014 13:05 - Tegan: Neither true, nor a fact. But 'true fact' is a truism.
29 Sep 2014 13:05 - Tegan: So there's that
29 Sep 2014 13:06 - Tegan: Man, I'm in a monday mood. Sigh.
29 Sep 2014 13:07 - Alex Bunn: I just ate a lovely Gulash from EAT
29 Sep 2014 13:07 - Alex Bunn: That helped
29 Sep 2014 13:07 - Tegan: I decided to try itsu again. Bad decision.
29 Sep 2014 13:07 - Tegan: That shit is nasty.
29 Sep 2014 13:10 - Krizia: Hahahaha !   I'm in I won't work again mood, so I'll participate in any sort of conversa!!! it's been a very very slow day :$
29 Sep 2014 13:16 - Lorna: I leave my job tomorrow. So anything I do badly today is someone else's problem. Comforting. And in no way motivating.
29 Sep 2014 13:17 - Krizia: ÓåíÓåíÓåí congrats! !!
29 Sep 2014 13:37 - Tegan: Party cones!
29 Sep 2014 14:45 - Sam Roberts: I love itsu! The rare salmon steak is one of my all time favorite work lunches
29 Sep 2014 15:14 - Tegan: They leave a lot to be desired in the world of noodle soups
29 Sep 2014 15:15 - Tegan: Tomato soup isn't Japanese!
29 Sep 2014 15:15 - Tegan: They have taken 'fusion' to a terrible place
29 Sep 2014 15:23 - Hannah Murphy: Soup is poor but their sushi is the top
29 Sep 2014 15:27 - Tegan: They also don't do any veg sushi really
29 Sep 2014 15:27 - Tegan: Which makes wasabi my lunchtime fave
29 Sep 2014 15:33 - Angela: Itsu used to have some really nice veggie potsu but they have got rid of them and replaced them with chicken and duck. I was mighty disappointed and now all their veggie food sucks
29 Sep 2014 15:34 - Angela: Apart from "selected stores", lucky bastards.
29 Sep 2014 15:35 - Angela: Best veggie sushi is crushh. Crussh?
29 Sep 2014 15:35 - Angela: It all looks wrong!
30 Sep 2014 09:32 - Hannah Murphy: <Media omitted>
30 Sep 2014 09:32 - Hannah Murphy: Really hard to tell if my baby cousin loves or hates her mum
30 Sep 2014 09:32 - Hannah Murphy: I often misspell 'dear' tbh

30 Sep 2014 13:27 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: Is he in front of an oven? Nice touch.
30 Sep 2014 16:03 - Angela: I don't even know how to express how that comment made me feel
30 Sep 2014 16:03 - Angela: A cross between amusement and horror
30 Sep 2014 16:04 - Angela: üôÄüòøüòπ
30 Sep 2014 16:27 - Alex Bunn: Lol well noticed!
30 Sep 2014 17:56 - Sam Roberts: Sooo... my band's playing tonight

30 Sep 2014 20:52 - Vanessa: They didn't have tickets
30 Sep 2014 20:52 - Vanessa: They used their charm to get in
30 Sep 2014 21:04 - Alex Bunn: Gay
30 Sep 2014 21:22 - Sam Roberts: I changed the bouncer's perception of homoerotica
30 Sep 2014 21:22 - Sam Roberts: Nohomo
30 Sep 2014 21:23 - Bongo: Everything about that sentence was indeedhomo
30 Sep 2014 21:23 - Bongo: That's like saying "I hate Jews"

30 Sep 2014 21:25 - Alex Bunn: <Media omitted>
30 Sep 2014 22:06 - Owen: Whats the story sam?
30 Sep 2014 23:08 - Sam Roberts: That's about it really
30 Sep 2014 23:09 - Sam Roberts: Had no tickets, chatted with the bouncer, turns out he's a really nice guy who loves my milkshake
30 Sep 2014 23:09 - Sam Roberts: Free tickets for everyone
1 Oct 2014 07:56 - Owen: Sounds like he changed your perception then.
1 Oct 2014 20:07 - Vanessa: Is anybody interested in seeing the Nick Cave movie 20,000 days?
1 Oct 2014 20:17 - Tegan: I'd be up for that
1 Oct 2014 20:28 - Vanessa: They are showing it at the Prince Charles
1 Oct 2014 20:48 - Krizia: I'll be up for that as well! When?
1 Oct 2014 20:53 - Vanessa: I was thinking Sat during the day just because they predict it to be raining
1 Oct 2014 20:53 - Vanessa: But I'm flexible
1 Oct 2014 20:54 - Tegan: Could do....
1 Oct 2014 20:54 - Tegan: I don't have plans
1 Oct 2014 20:54 - Tegan: I don't think

1 Oct 2014 20:55 - Krizia: Mmmm let me check!!! I have tickets to a thing I just need to know at what time it starts!
1 Oct 2014 20:55 - Tegan: That is very inconsiderate of them
1 Oct 2014 21:38 - Hannah Murphy: If anybody free tomorrow, em Pearce and I are going to a free gig at the shoreditch town hall - sexy French accordion player and gypsy band if you're into that

6 Oct 2014 13:26 - Angela: The cat is slightly high maintenance - the one time we ever left her alone overnight she brought a revenge pigeon into the house (her only ever kill), so as long as you can be in the house at least at some point overnight she should be fine!
6 Oct 2014 13:27 - Angela: I live in streatham btw if that's ok for you?
6 Oct 2014 14:32 - Owen: Angela you could train your cat to go to the loo like the cat in meet the parents.

14 Oct 2014 10:57 - Krizia: Hoho no I really don't know!! Joe?
14 Oct 2014 10:59 - Owen: Why do you want to learn spanish dave. Are you planning on eloping with kritzia, much to sam's dismay?
14 Oct 2014 11:00 - Dave: Erm.....no?
14 Oct 2014 11:00 - Owen: Sounds suspicious.
14 Oct 2014 11:00 - Krizia: Why won't you learn Spanish??
14 Oct 2014 11:01 - Krizia: It's a beaaauuuttiiful language
14 Oct 2014 11:05 - Hannah Murphy: Go on international house
14 Oct 2014 11:06 - Hannah Murphy: They do semi -intensive courses (twice a week) for only 25¬£ - if you do a special option where you're being taught by trainee teachers (rather than qualified ones)
14 Oct 2014 11:09 - Dave: I saw that it was cheap - is the teaching good?
14 Oct 2014 11:50 - Joe Jarman: What do you want, start from basics book style learning, conversation practice or wat?
14 Oct 2014 11:50 - Joe Jarman: I've never had a spanish lesson üòê
14 Oct 2014 11:56 - Dave: I'll need to start from the very beginning. I like the idea of some lessons to get the conversational side and it's nice to have a teacher.
14 Oct 2014 11:56 - Dave: What did you do before going travelling?
14 Oct 2014 11:57 - Sam Roberts: I'd be interested in joining if you find something Dave, I've always wondered what Kriz is saying
14 Oct 2014 11:59 - Krizia: Hahahhaha!!! You don't want to know ;)
14 Oct 2014 11:59 - Joe Jarman: I watched a lot of tv and had a spanish lady friend aaaand did an audio course a while ago. Went to Espa√±a a few times, did duolingo which is great but you can't beat conversation practice with local people
14 Oct 2014 11:59 - Joe Jarman: Because that's your end goal right
14 Oct 2014 12:00 - Joe Jarman: So check out italki and verbling web sites
14 Oct 2014 12:00 - Joe Jarman: There's butcket loads of spics to Make friends with in London too ÓêÖ
14 Oct 2014 12:02 - Joe Jarman: I think I'm shit now because of a lack of conversation practice but I still understand a lot
14 Oct 2014 12:03 - Sam Roberts: I got on really well with duolingo, really fun way to learn some basics, I feel like a commitment now would help a lot though
14 Oct 2014 12:05 - Owen: Just shout loads and say everything is beuuutiiifullll. Thats spanish isn't it?
14 Oct 2014 12:18 - Joe Jarman: That's what krizea does definitely Óêâ

14 Oct 2014 13:08 - Sam Roberts: She's a bit molesty as a teacher, you probably want to study somewhere public

22 Oct 2014 10:17 - Alex Bunn: A woman is out playing golf and she gets stung by a bee. It's annoying, but she finishes her game. Afterwards, she's having a drink in the clubhouse and mentions to one of the golf pros hanging out there what happened.
"Oh that's too bad," he says. "Where did you get stung?"
"Right between the first and second hole," she tells him.
"Hmmm," he says, "Sounds like your stance is too wide."

23 Oct 2014 11:54 - Owen: That is the kind of sweet shit I'm talking about shaggy. Who wants a cure for malaria when we could have ninja turtles. Once you have ninja turtles the cure for malaria inevitably follows.

23 Oct 2014 18:07 - Adimina: Do we win a live Simpson?
23 Oct 2014 18:07 - Dave: Yeah but any self respecting Simpsons quiz would write most of them off.
23 Oct 2014 18:16 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: I bet it will be crazily hard
23 Oct 2014 18:17 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: Like "who took over as head writer in 1996?"

23 Oct 2014 19:09 - Tegan: Does that pub exist? Or would you just like to go to a pub of that name?

30 Oct 2014 12:13 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: What the fuck did you just fucking say about me, you little bitch? I‚Äôll have you know I graduated top of my class in the Navy Seals, and I‚Äôve been involved in numerous secret raids on Al-Quaeda, and I have over 300 confirmed kills. I am trained in gorilla warfare and I‚Äôm the top sniper in the entire US armed forces. You are nothing to me but just another target. I will wipe you the fuck out with precision the likes of which has never been seen before on this Earth, mark my fucking words. You think you can get away with saying that shit to me over the Internet? Think again, fucker. As we speak I am contacting my secret network of spies across the¬†USAand your IP is being traced right now so you better prepare for the storm, maggot. The storm that wipes out the pathetic little thing you call your life. You‚Äôre fucking dead, kid. I can be anywhere, anytime, and I can kill you in over seven hundred ways, and that‚Äôs just with my bare hands. Not only am I extensively trained in unarmed combat, but I have access to the entire arsenal of the United States Marine Corps and I will use it to its full extent to wipe your miserable ass off the face of the continent, you little shit. If only you could have known what unholy retribution your little ‚Äúclever‚Äù comment was about to bring down upon you, maybe you would have held your fucking tongue. But you couldn‚Äôt, you didn‚Äôt, and now you‚Äôre paying the price, you goddamn idiot. I will shit fury all over you and you will drown in it. You‚Äôre fucking dead, kiddo.

4 Nov 2014 12:09 - Joe Jarman: Failing that, ben thanh market
4 Nov 2014 12:09 - Adimina: Haha
4 Nov 2014 12:56 - Owen: For a while i was trying to understand that as some racist joke. "Are black people often homeless or something?!"

Then i realised you meant the camping shop.
4 Nov 2014 12:59 - Owen: Maybe they are avid campers. Thats not a sterotype I have heard though.
4 Nov 2014 13:05 - Adimina: Racist Owen
4 Nov 2014 13:08 - Joe Jarman: Black people hate camping, thus more.likely to give up sleeping bags?! Óêâ

4 Nov 2014 17:08 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: 4 MORE YEARS! 4 MORE YEARS!
4 Nov 2014 19:01 - Lorna: Maybe you could afford a deposit and buy the house if you all club together...
4 Nov 2014 19:04 - Owen: You clearly haven't seen how much money that house spends on beer lorna üòÉ
4 Nov 2014 19:05 - Owen: They could probably get the deposit by saving up a week's worth of empties and selling the aluminum.
4 Nov 2014 19:11 - Bongo: Yea but then the cleaner wouldn't have anything to pick up
4 Nov 2014 19:26 - Sam Roberts: Can't believe she's lasted so long
4 Nov 2014 19:26 - Sam Roberts: Even through bin-gate, and this Saturday's binge fest
4 Nov 2014 19:28 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: Didn't the landlord get it for like 50k?
4 Nov 2014 21:26 - Sam Roberts: ¬£50 and a bag full of nails
4 Nov 2014 21:55 - Bongo: Lol bin-gate
4 Nov 2014 21:57 - Bongo: Some witch was like "have this house on yonder but beware! mould grows everywhere, ye shall be plagued by rats and forever there will be the foulest stench enflicted upon man"
4 Nov 2014 21:57 - Bongo: But lucky for him he found you guys
4 Nov 2014 22:13 - Owen: I think the foul stench will clear itself right up when phil goes abroad for a bit.
4 Nov 2014 22:21 - Sam Roberts: That's the only thing keeping the mould at bay

5 Nov 2014 12:57 - Owen: A conversation i just overheard between two kids: "do you think scorpion from mortal kombat could overcome the combined might of the chaos gods on battle?"... I teach such nerds!
5 Nov 2014 12:57 - Owen: They are literally like comic book guy from the simpsons.
5 Nov 2014 12:59 - Sam Roberts: .... well could he?
5 Nov 2014 13:01 - Adimina: <Media omitted>
5 Nov 2014 13:01 - Adimina: Look who's come to say hello
5 Nov 2014 13:03 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: Scorpion ain't all that
5 Nov 2014 13:33 - Phil: Shut your dirty mouth mike you sub human sub zero fanboy. Obviously scorpion can't battle all the chaos gods but he'd do better than pretty much anyone else.
5 Nov 2014 14:07 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: People just like scorpion cause of the stupid sob story. He's like those contestants on X factor who are on there cause their dad died even though everyone knows they won't win
5 Nov 2014 14:14 - Alex Bunn: üëèüëè
5 Nov 2014 14:29 - Phil: The sob story came later when the drooling masses couldn't handle that a bad ass ninja had no back story beyond being a bad ass ninja.
5 Nov 2014 14:48 - Shaggy: Yellow is a pretty awesome colour
5 Nov 2014 14:50 - Owen: Scorpion is a pretty awesome animal.
5 Nov 2014 15:26 - Dave: Skulls are cool
5 Nov 2014 15:43 - Shaggy: And so is fire
5 Nov 2014 16:00 - Phil: Also, harpoons.
5 Nov 2014 16:13 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: These are dumb arguments
5 Nov 2014 16:16 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: He's a cheap-ass teleporting bitch
5 Nov 2014 16:19 - Phil: Someone got his ass beat by scorpion to many times. He was just the vessel man.

9 Nov 2014 20:14 - Martha: Yes. Have to buy them in advance since it usually sells out. There may not be many left next to each other though. Would people prefer to be loners sitting on their own or should we go for Tuesday?
9 Nov 2014 20:15 - Sam Roberts: I'm totally climbing Tuesday, well in for tomorrow though

9 Nov 2014 21:07 - Sam Roberts: The horde, always
9 Nov 2014 21:09 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: I prefer Tues at the Barbican

11 Nov 2014 09:42 - Dave: Can you imagine?
11 Nov 2014 10:48 - Sam Roberts: Thought it was a super racist headline in first glance, I'm much happier at the thought of ninja terrorist Mike
11 Nov 2014 12:46 - Phil: I think that is the closest anyone can reasonably come to being called a teenage mutant ninja turtle by a newspaper. Congrats mike.

11 Nov 2014 19:51 - Lorna: I'm super close
11 Nov 2014 20:12 - Shaggy: We're in the barbican centre, need to go to level -2
12 Nov 2014 10:33 - Alex Bunn: I think interstellar is worth a second watch
12 Nov 2014 10:33 - Alex Bunn: With lowered expectations
12 Nov 2014 10:33 - Alex Bunn: There was a lot to be appreciated in that film
12 Nov 2014 10:33 - Alex Bunn: But there was also a lot that was lame
12 Nov 2014 10:34 - Owen: Phil needs to see it again definitely. Because he spent half the film in the loo
12 Nov 2014 10:34 - Alex Bunn: Shit. Probably not worth a convo here cos theres peeps that havnt seen it
12 Nov 2014 10:34 - Henry Dranks: I absolutely loved it. beautiful homage to some of my fav scifi
12 Nov 2014 10:34 - Sam Roberts: It's weird, I really enjoyed maybe 9/10 of it, but felt cheated by the end
12 Nov 2014 10:34 - Owen: The last 15 minutes just shouldn't have been in the film
12 Nov 2014 10:35 - Tegan: Lots of Sci Fi films s have that quality though
12 Nov 2014 10:36 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: Yeah like Source Code
12 Nov 2014 10:37 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: Interstellar was pretty daft, can't say I wasn't entertained though
12 Nov 2014 10:37 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: Low marks for the Barbican cinema though
12 Nov 2014 10:37 - Shaggy: I think Matthew mcconaghey had a speech impediment, did he have a stroke?
12 Nov 2014 10:38 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: I think its more that the sound was shit
12 Nov 2014 10:38 - Owen: Yeah barbican cinema was rubbish
12 Nov 2014 10:38 - Owen: Barbican't  more like! Amiright?!
12 Nov 2014 10:38 - Alex Bunn: Yeah i think we might have had a better experience somewhere else
12 Nov 2014 10:38 - Alex Bunn: My fave was the sarcastic robot
12 Nov 2014 10:38 - Shaggy: IMAX
12 Nov 2014 10:49 - Martha: Meh, I agree the screen was pretty weeny, but it was nice to go somewhere close to me for once. Thank you folks for coming to my neck of the woods! That wins you 3 times I don't complain about going east :)
12 Nov 2014 10:49 - Martha: Sarcastic robot wins it.
12 Nov 2014 10:50 - Owen: Marthican't more like! Amiright folks!?
12 Nov 2014 10:50 - Owen: üêõ
12 Nov 2014 10:51 - Sam Roberts: Could've done with subtitles
12 Nov 2014 10:52 - Martha: I just realised: you know that film 'contact' I said it was quite like? Matthew mcconnorghdkdkd was in that too.
12 Nov 2014 10:52 - Sam Roberts: I liked the barbican centre though, felt like we were running through a Kafka novel to get there
12 Nov 2014 10:52 - Martha: Yes to subtitles, then we might have been able to understand over bun's rustling.
12 Nov 2014 10:54 - Sam Roberts: Hahaha I'd forgotten that! Full points for rustling bunny!
12 Nov 2014 11:30 - Alex Bunn: Shouldve munched during re-entry
12 Nov 2014 11:31 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: Or during one of those organ solos
12 Nov 2014 11:33 - Joe Jarman: Anyone left who hasn't seen it?
12 Nov 2014 11:33 - Joe Jarman: I want to go today üòÑ
12 Nov 2014 12:05 - Phil: I went for one perfectly timed piss. I missed a few minutes of crying and "daddy please don't go".

14 Nov 2014 11:14 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: <Media omitted>
14 Nov 2014 11:14 - Tegan: I think Mike also counts each consecutive Newgate from one person as one message
14 Nov 2014 11:15 - Tegan: So you need to be more strategic

14 Nov 2014 11:24 - Owen: OP will deliver....?
14 Nov 2014 11:33 - Sam Roberts: *did. I wonder if text typos are improving humanity's lateral thinking. It's like every fifth message is a little logic puzzle

14 Nov 2014 12:18 - Owen: Sam better be careful because someone likes italians too much.
14 Nov 2014 12:19 - Tegan: (The idea that that is shaggy's problem is more than gently misogynistic)
14 Nov 2014 12:20 - Owen: Dave! Get your woman back in line. She is talking out of turn!
14 Nov 2014 12:22 - Tegan: Looking for an emoji to express my feminist vitriol...

5 Dec 2014 14:15 - Martha: Not much to be honest! It looks a bit richer here and there (fancy tv screens, scary automatic video capture in all of the lecture rooms) but it's still a nostalgia bonanza.
5 Dec 2014 14:22 - Tegan: Nice
5 Dec 2014 15:55 - Dave: How did your talk go?
5 Dec 2014 16:00 - Martha: Went well, thanks!!

7 Dec 2014 02:48 - Alex Bunn: And then i had to get the super cool nightbus home

8 Dec 2014 18:22 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: <Media omitted>
8 Dec 2014 19:27 - Vinay: Lol
8 Dec 2014 19:28 - Vinay: I'm up for skating on Wednesday... Hopefully it won't be raining
9 Dec 2014 13:36 - Dave: Would anyone like to take my place kayaking from Limehouse to the Victoria park winter wonderland thing? It clashes with my work Xmas meal. Happy to offer the ticket at a good discount. X
9 Dec 2014 13:46 - Shaggy: Lol you have to pay money to do it?!
9 Dec 2014 14:18 - Joe Jarman: Yeah it sounds pretty brutal kayaking in this weather
9 Dec 2014 14:19 - Tegan: We didn't remember what cold was like when we signed up
9 Dec 2014 14:19 - Tegan: I'm probably going to end up in tears
9 Dec 2014 14:20 - Tegan: Good group though- Petia etc
9 Dec 2014 14:21 - Phil: Is petia a group or a person?
9 Dec 2014 14:22 - Joe Jarman: I like those guys
9 Dec 2014 14:22 - Joe Jarman: Petias not a big joe jarman fan
9 Dec 2014 14:22 - Joe Jarman: I think I consumed something naughty off her macbook

9 Dec 2014 14:23 - Tegan: You should come to winter wonderland for the aftermath
9 Dec 2014 14:23 - Joe Jarman: But I have my work party tomorrow
9 Dec 2014 14:23 - Tegan: Il have stopped crying by then
9 Dec 2014 14:23 - Tegan: Ah well
9 Dec 2014 14:45 - Sam Roberts: Who's organising? Well there be wet suits?
9 Dec 2014 14:47 - Tegan: BYO :(
9 Dec 2014 14:47 - Sam Roberts: Winter wonderland would be an excellent meet up and skate place
9 Dec 2014 14:47 - +44 7944 609055 left
9 Dec 2014 14:52 - Shaggy: I would cut your losses right now and bail, like em just now
9 Dec 2014 14:57 - Sam Roberts: That'd be awesome with a proper suit+ gloves
9 Dec 2014 15:08 - Tegan: Nah,  I'm gon' do it.  Join us after for mulled wine? Is there an ice rink at the Victoria Park winterthingaling?
9 Dec 2014 15:08 - Sam Roberts: I'll give you 40% survival without
9 Dec 2014 15:21 - Alex Bunn: In victoria park yes there is obe
9 Dec 2014 19:30 - Dave: Sam, sounds like you'd like my ticket...
9 Dec 2014 19:33 - Sam Roberts: Gimme a wetsuit and I'm there!
9 Dec 2014 19:34 - Sam Roberts: How much are the tickets?
9 Dec 2014 19:34 - Phil: Surely you can't kayak in this weather without a wetsuit. This is a country where they barely trust people near ankle deep water without a 2m railing and some barbed wire
9 Dec 2014 19:36 - Dave: I'm loathed to say how much the tickets were but for you, ¬£15.
9 Dec 2014 19:41 - Tegan: Brown wooded butttocks

9 Dec 2014 19:49 - Sam Roberts: That all worked out nicely! Need anything from the shop Phil?
9 Dec 2014 19:50 - Phil: Depends if you want stir fry. If yes, read house bants.
9 Dec 2014 20:21 - Tegan: Hope I didn't put you out of your way with my Wolf boy beer cry
9 Dec 2014 20:24 - Sam Roberts: Made me leave the office as it happens, I'm cook with that woolfie

10 Dec 2014 12:12 - Sam Roberts: Victoria park for winter wonderland + seeing if Teeg survives
10 Dec 2014 12:13 - Sam Roberts: The guys can skate and the ladies can drink mulled wine and watch
10 Dec 2014 13:29 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: Apparently we're going to WW after the office Xmas party on Friday
10 Dec 2014 13:30 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: What could go wrong
10 Dec 2014 13:31 - Shaggy: What's that?

10 Dec 2014 13:54 - Dave: Looks like I'm gonna be kayaking too. The more warm hugs the better at vikkie park
10 Dec 2014 16:38 - Sam Roberts: Sooo I've got a heap still to do, looks like I might be stuck here for the night :(
10 Dec 2014 16:39 - Sam Roberts: You got to love having a nice relaxing morning , then finding a shitstorm when you get back
10 Dec 2014 16:52 - Owen: What time and where are people going to be?

10 Dec 2014 18:10 - Alex Bunn: Pub in London Bridge?
10 Dec 2014 18:12 - Sam Roberts: No word from teeg and Dave, I think they've succumbed to hypothermia already
10 Dec 2014 18:12 - Sam Roberts: I'm going to be stuck here couple of hours at least, might come join if you're out though
10 Dec 2014 18:13 - Alex Bunn: Thats what i was hoping for. Need to organise something due to my lack of phone network and dependency on wifi
10 Dec 2014 18:14 - Alex Bunn: Phil if we decide will you come?
10 Dec 2014 18:24 - Alex Bunn: Ok i'm going home
10 Dec 2014 18:24 - Alex Bunn: Bye
10 Dec 2014 18:29 - Phil: Guess not
10 Dec 2014 18:30 - Phil: üêí

10 Dec 2014 22:30 - Tegan: Yup, kayaking is also pretty toasty it turns out :)
10 Dec 2014 22:31 - Lorna: How was the winterville thing?

11 Dec 2014 16:12 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: Rice + laxative?
11 Dec 2014 16:13 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: Favourite business terms at qubit seem to be 'deep-dive (into)' and 'verticals'
11 Dec 2014 16:16 - Phil: Urban dictionary word of the day: a crapella
11 Dec 2014 16:30 - Tegan: We're always deep diving into verticals
11 Dec 2014 16:30 - Tegan: Do you do much silo-ing?
11 Dec 2014 17:43 - Bongo: My favourite business term is haircut
11 Dec 2014 17:43 - Bongo: Although it's only a financial one

14 Dec 2014 11:20 - Owen: Why was she removed instead of leaving? Bit rude, no?
14 Dec 2014 11:20 - Alex Bunn: Pipe down
14 Dec 2014 11:42 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: I think you can get removed for inactivity, or not paying the 67p charge
14 Dec 2014 13:20 - Owen: That answers my question much better than "pipe down."
14 Dec 2014 13:22 - Owen: Phil said there was something going on today. Is that the case? Shall we bring beer?

28 Dec 2014 22:06 - Phil: Imma have to leave some of these whatsapp groups. Reading about all the Jackie Chan and lemon chicken that's happening without me is hard. I'll come crawling back when I have beach photos to retaliate with. It's been an honour and a pleasure bantsing with y'all.
28 Dec 2014 22:06 - Phil left
28 Dec 2014 22:07 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: <Media omitted>
28 Dec 2014 22:07 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: NOOOO
28 Dec 2014 23:10 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: Well, I for one am shocked, saddened, and quite drunk by the lack of uproar at this loss.  People leave this group all the time. Usually if I have any reaction at all, it's a positive one. Good riddance says I, for a herd of buffulo can only move as fast as its slowest, and least comical member.  But tonight, we have lost a true The Horde titan. He never contributed a lot, but everything he did was hilariously accurate, terse, and withering in execution. He will be sorely missed.

29 Dec 2014 18:14 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: Deal.
29 Dec 2014 18:33 - Owen: That explains why the beer would be better.
29 Dec 2014 18:37 - Sam Roberts: The other Brown's
29 Dec 2014 18:45 - Owen: I like how bongo knows all the strip clubs.

6 Jan 16:34 - Shaggy: Well not documentary but whatever
6 Jan 16:39 - Alex Bunn: Wtf is that movie?
6 Jan 16:40 - Owen: Maybe. However i can imagine the film being about motor neuron disease instead of black hole mathematics like it should be!
6 Jan 16:42 - Joe Jarman: Can't ya just come round and make pie already
6 Jan 16:46 - Tegan: I think it's mainly about stevesy. With some black hole mathematics.
6 Jan 16:46 - Tegan: It is named erroneously
6 Jan 16:47 - Tegan: S' meant to be aiight though
6 Jan 16:47 - Tegan: No pie

7 Jan 08:44 - Sam Roberts: We're going tonight... Friday drinks to break it down?
7 Jan 09:19 - Joe Jarman: Aww my god, that was the most racist haircut ever

7 Jan 09:26 - Joe Jarman: My haircut is normal it was just delivered in a racist way
7 Jan 09:26 - Joe Jarman: Peter's hairdresser at the end of our road
7 Jan 09:36 - Tegan: I don't know if you guys should be financially spring racists
7 Jan 09:36 - Tegan: Supporting
7 Jan 09:36 - Tegan: Do you have to ask him race related questions to hear it,  or does the hate just come pouring out?
7 Jan 09:37 - Owen: "So what kind of negro haircut do you want today. Also i think the pakis shouldn't be allowed the vote."
7 Jan 09:37 - Owen: That kind of racist?
7 Jan 09:58 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: In my experience, most of his hate is at eastern Europeans
7 Jan 09:58 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: And immigrants in general
7 Jan 09:58 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: Which is weird because he's Italian
7 Jan 10:01 - Owen: Well all those poles come over here and eat our pasta.
7 Jan 10:15 - Joe Jarman: He is italian
7 Jan 10:16 - Joe Jarman: But he was here before we were even born apparently
7 Jan 10:16 - Joe Jarman: Which is amazing coz his english is really poor

7 Jan 12:01 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: We went there last time, how about the spoons?
7 Jan 12:03 - Owen: Wherever we go I will sit in a corner crying about the lack of booze.
7 Jan 12:03 - Owen: Can i smell your beer please mike?
7 Jan 12:06 - Tegan: Mike's on the white wine
7 Jan 12:06 - Tegan: Spritzeritzeritzers

7 Jan 12:08 - Owen: Can i smell your wine then. Just a whiff, thats all I need!
7 Jan 12:09 - Lorna: Yay beer and film! I'm sold.
7 Jan 12:10 - Tegan: Is anyone on orange?
7 Jan 12:13 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: My Dad, I got one
7 Jan 12:13 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: This may be why they're stopping it
7 Jan 12:50 - Owen: Eliza is with ee. I think they do it as well.
7 Jan 12:53 - Lorna: Same thing, ee is a merge of orange and t mobile. Maybe t mobile wear the trousers which is why orange Wednesdays is finishing
7 Jan 12:57 - Shaggy: They are same thing but if you were with t mobile you don't get orange Wednesday now
7 Jan 14:12 - Alex Bunn: <Media omitted>
7 Jan 14:12 - Alex Bunn: Simpsons gags are the best!
7 Jan 14:18 - Shaggy: I don't get it. Is that a deliberate misspelling?
7 Jan 14:18 - Alex Bunn: Itchy and scrathy land episode. Do your homework
7 Jan 14:18 - Alex Bunn: I'm disappointed
7 Jan 14:20 - Tegan: The gag is weakened by the fact that you can get a bart mug right next to it
7 Jan 14:20 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: omg Shaggy, like seriously

7 Jan 15:03 - Tegan: Who do I call? ?
7 Jan 15:09 - Alex Bunn: Infiltrate their circle of trust
7 Jan 15:14 - Tegan: Probable false alarm.  I think they're just idiots.
7 Jan 15:14 - Tegan: Probably rich idiots.
7 Jan 15:22 - Shaggy: She sells Seychelles
7 Jan 15:27 - Tegan: But where?
7 Jan 15:31 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: On the East African real estate market
7 Jan 15:46 - Owen: Tell them you can help them. Then steal all thier money. Stealings not wrong if you do it to rich idiots... like Kevin Bacon

7 Jan 16:38 - Sam Roberts: Never knew that! Most awesome!
7 Jan 16:39 - Sam Roberts: Just when you thought spoons couldn't get cheaper or more cheerful
7 Jan 16:39 - Sam Roberts: Everyone aiming for 7 then? I might be a touch early
7 Jan 16:41 - Tegan: Early sounds good
7 Jan 16:42 - Tegan: I still can't quite engender what my job is or why it's important
7 Jan 16:42 - Tegan: Remember,  dammit
7 Jan 16:42 - Tegan: This swipe business is getting worse and worse
7 Jan 16:47 - Lorna: I'll be a bit early. Is it 20% off drinks too?
7 Jan 16:55 - Tegan: I dunnoo
7 Jan 16:56 - Dave: Nah, but this is spoons so drinks are reasonable, even on the wharf.
7 Jan 17:03 - Alex Bunn: Cheapskates
7 Jan 17:04 - Tegan: Such a long time til payday...

9 Jan 08:40 - Pete Morey: <Media omitted>
9 Jan 08:43 - Tegan: Government is a dirty perv
9 Jan 08:43 - Tegan: But the individual loves it
9 Jan 08:48 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: Apparently if you have Android, whatsapp is super secure
9 Jan 08:48 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: Like not even WhatsApp can read your messages, only the other persons exact phone
9 Jan 08:49 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: So we can finally make that terrorist cell group we've been talking about
9 Jan 08:50 - Shaggy: Unless of course you then email yourself the whole thread so that you can analyze who is most worthy in the eyes of Muhammad
9 Jan 08:53 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: Lol
9 Jan 09:00 - Pete Morey: Oops...
9 Jan 09:17 - Owen: Suprisingly Sam won Muhammad's favour.

9 Jan 13:34 - Hannah Murphy: Now there's two hostage situations in France  at the same time that are linked
9 Jan 13:38 - Bongo: Stay safe
9 Jan 13:39 - Bongo: Hide up the eifel tower until it's all over

19 Jan 21:01 - Owen: Yeah what the hell?! Did you hire your years supply of cleaners all at once?
19 Jan 21:01 - Owen: Or maybe it was shaggy causing all the mess all along.
19 Jan 21:03 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: Man you should see the projector room

22 Jan 14:14 - Sam Roberts: Pretty sure it isn't dude...
22 Jan 14:14 - Sam Roberts: You having that thing where you hear a word for the first time, then it's everywhere all of a sudden?
22 Jan 14:14 - Sam Roberts: I'm sure there'a a conspiracy around that
22 Jan 14:22 - Angela: There's a theory that says when you learn another language, you hear a word regularly without taking it in it for ages, and then one day when your ability gets good enough you suddenly 'notice' it and either understand it through context or you look it up or whatever. Then after that, you notice it every time it's said because you know it's there. Which is spooky if it's also true in English, cos it means you're just deaf to this word for years but it's actually been there all along.......
22 Jan 14:23 - Alex Bunn: Good fact!
22 Jan 14:23 - Sam Roberts: Oh god, have you all being talking about jingoistic braggadocio all this time!? I've been dead to it until now!

24 Jan 10:48 - Shaggy: Life without beer is like beer without alcohol
24 Jan 12:35 - Martha: I have some work but would enjoy a microbrew later

24 Jan 16:03 - Alex Bunn: Gonna cook dinner instead üòã
24 Jan 16:37 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: There's this demented airport up a mountain in courchevel
24 Jan 16:37 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: <Media omitted>
24 Jan 16:37 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: Youtube it, its crazy
24 Jan 17:01 - Lorna: <Media omitted>
24 Jan 17:03 - Alex Bunn: My uncle has flown his plane into that airport
24 Jan 17:05 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: Your uncle is mental
24 Jan 17:22 - Vanessa: How come I've never heard about this uncle
24 Jan 17:23 - Alex Bunn: Well unfortunately he's not with us anymore üòì
24 Jan 17:25 - Shaggy: Heaven is halfpipe
24 Jan 17:30 - Joe Jarman: Hey shagz gonna restart your thing
24 Jan 17:30 - Joe Jarman: Thin it's almost done
24 Jan 17:45 - Shaggy: I thought it was done
24 Jan 18:28 - Sam Roberts: Home brew!
24 Jan 18:29 - Sam Roberts: Hey, don't put it on yet
24 Jan 18:29 - Sam Roberts: We'll be done with this keg in a week, then we can have a brew off
24 Jan 18:29 - Alex Bunn: Hows the micro breweries?
24 Jan 18:29 - Alex Bunn: (Shags and V)
24 Jan 18:37 - Shaggy: Exquisite flavour of hops makes you really question the totalitarian rule of major corporate beer companies enthral lung their rule of blandness on out temporary existence
24 Jan 18:43 - Alex Bunn: And who says beer kills brain cells
24 Jan 20:01 - Tegan: Bastards
24 Jan 20:02 - Vinay: Jon snow
24 Jan 20:12 - Lorna: Too late Sam- beer's a brewin'. But we're gonna bottle it so it'll keep for a brew off.
24 Jan 23:34 - Sam Roberts: It's ON!
24 Jan 23:34 - Sam Roberts: I'm going to find out how to brew for high percentage, make some home brew special brew
25 Jan 01:01 - Lorna: If you brew with 1/10th of the water, then it'll make beer 10 times as strong right?...
25 Jan 01:09 - Sam Roberts: Sounds legit
25 Jan 01:10 - Sam Roberts: Or with 10x the sugar
25 Jan 01:11 - Sam Roberts: I hear the alcohol is just a calculation on the sugar
25 Jan 05:47 - Shaggy: Really? Sweet
25 Jan 09:15 - Owen: Alcohol content is sugar and yeast strain. Beer yeast will die at a lower abv than wine yeast.
25 Jan 10:09 - Lorna: So... Add wine yeast instead! This syrupy, sweet wine special brew will definitely give you the shits. üí©
25 Jan 12:21 - Dave: Mix in a load of vodka too.
25 Jan 12:21 - Dave: (Pro tip)
25 Jan 15:45 - Sam Roberts: Enjoying all of these, keep them coming
25 Jan 15:45 - Sam Roberts: Combined, I should be able to get beer over 30%
25 Jan 15:45 - Sam Roberts: I shall call it Tombstone
25 Jan 15:46 - Shaggy: You can freeze it and separate alcohol, there's one you can get in brewdog that's 52%
25 Jan 15:48 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: I think at some point you can't call it beer anymore haha
25 Jan 15:48 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: Sorites pissed paradox
27 Jan 07:31 - Tegan: Whiplash tonight at the wharf?
27 Jan 07:42 - Lorna: Yes to whiplash. Can I suggest a more central cinema?
27 Jan 07:47 - Tegan: We'll probably wharf as Dave has to work late
27 Jan 07:47 - Tegan: If he finishes wallet we could maybe get elsewhere
27 Jan 07:47 - Tegan: Had to be a cineworld for half price Tuesday
27 Jan 08:01 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: Down for whiplash,
27 Jan 08:02 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: Wherever, as long as you decide by like 6
27 Jan 12:11 - Lorna: Tuesday deal is good. Were you thinking 6:10 or 8:50 for the film?
27 Jan 13:16 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: Will have to be 8.50 for me
27 Jan 14:11 - Tegan: 8.50 sounds aiight
27 Jan 18:06 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: What time to meet?
27 Jan 18:16 - Hannah Murphy: <Media omitted>
27 Jan 18:16 - Hannah Murphy: <Media omitted>
27 Jan 18:20 - Hannah Murphy: I'm guessing number 16 bus shelter may be referring to a place of conception?
27 Jan 18:20 - Lorna: I'm bailing on the cinema guys
27 Jan 18:23 - Alex Bunn: Lol that bus stop kid is a born winner!
27 Jan 18:41 - Vanessa: I was told that in Germany you have to ask permission on the name you want to give your child
27 Jan 18:42 - Tegan: Mike, are you still up for the wharf?
27 Jan 18:47 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: Sure

27 Jan 21:05 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: <Media omitted>

27 Jan 23:26 - Owen: Good then.
27 Jan 23:26 - Owen: ?
27 Jan 23:37 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: Well I don't want to overhype it
27 Jan 23:37 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: But I have already, so yeah its amazing, see it at the cinema
27 Jan 23:41 - Tegan: Hype hype hype!
27 Jan 23:41 - Tegan: Made me angry
27 Jan 23:41 - Tegan: But was good
27 Jan 23:43 - Dave: Was pretty great. Visceral, exhausting cinema. In a good way.
28 Jan 06:42 - Angela: Why did it make you angry teegs?
28 Jan 07:41 - Tegan: Either because it celebrated a sad cycle of dependency, or because I'll never be that good at anything
28 Jan 07:41 - Tegan: Probably the latter
28 Jan 07:49 - Angela: Getting old to the point where that becomes apparent is rubbish! No longer do I have potential üò¢
28 Jan 07:49 - Angela: I had so much potential!
28 Jan 07:51 - Sam Roberts: I've switched from aiming at rock climbing legend to sexy pensioner
28 Jan 07:56 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: I don't agree that it celebrated it Teegs, it was pretty neutral
28 Jan 08:05 - Alex Bunn: Lol Sam
28 Jan 08:06 - Owen: I'll just aim for pensioner
28 Jan 08:18 - Tegan: That's why I did probably the later
28 Jan 08:18 - Tegan: Latter
28 Jan 08:19 - Tegan: I expect
28 Jan 08:19 - Tegan: Also lol, sam
28 Jan 08:41 - Sam Roberts: Talking of becoming a pensioner, it's m' birthday next Friday (6th), save the date for some drinking fun
28 Jan 08:49 - Adam Wills: Saved! What are we gonna do?
28 Jan 09:11 - Sam Roberts: Working on it just at the mo, suggestions welcome
28 Jan 09:11 - Sam Roberts: The only certainty is that there will be beers

28 Jan 09:33 - Shaggy: Oh right
28 Jan 09:33 - Alex Bunn: Too early
28 Jan 09:35 - Tegan: Sorry y'all
28 Jan 09:36 - Tegan: The sound you can probably hear is me cursing the day
28 Jan 12:48 - Sam Roberts: <Media omitted>

29 Jan 15:59 - Joe Jarman: What time you there sam
29 Jan 15:59 - Joe Jarman: I'm celebrating dodging a bankruptcy bullet
29 Jan 16:00 - Alex Bunn: Did you get redundancy?
29 Jan 16:02 - Joe Jarman: Not yet haha
29 Jan 16:02 - Joe Jarman: I'm just thankful for my student overdraft

29 Jan 17:31 - Bongo: Sweet I'm in
29 Jan 17:31 - Bongo: Like beef shin
29 Jan 17:31 - Bongo: <Media omitted>
29 Jan 17:31 - Bongo: Rubbed in garlic, parsley salt and balsal, left to cook for 8 hours
29 Jan 17:32 - Owen: Stab holes in it and push the garlic into the holes. It caramalises and infuses the meat when it cooks.
29 Jan 17:33 - Joe Jarman: See you at dlr?
29 Jan 17:33 - Owen: Trust me. Its a may zing!
29 Jan 17:33 - Dave: I'll be there in a min
29 Jan 17:34 - Shaggy: Garlic caramelises?
29 Jan 17:35 - Joe Jarman: When
29 Jan 17:35 - Joe Jarman: I'm there
29 Jan 17:35 - Joe Jarman: Smoking
29 Jan 17:36 - Dave: Now
29 Jan 17:37 - Joe Jarman: Canne c u jimmee
29 Jan 17:48 - Owen: Yeah garlic caramalises. If you deprive it of oxygen.
29 Jan 17:48 - Owen: Try wrapping a bulb of garlic in foil and sticking it in the oven at 180 for an hour. It comes out sticky and sweet but still as garlicy.
29 Jan 17:49 - Shaggy: Sweet
29 Jan 17:51 - Tegan: Mmmmmm
29 Jan 17:51 - Tegan: I'm going for a leaving drink, will join y'all afters

29 Jan 19:50 - Sam Roberts: Opposite the fellow, but they don't have a pin so I used the fellow one
29 Jan 19:50 - Sam Roberts: To be fair, happy hours over, and they don't have any Nintendo do we should probs move on
29 Jan 19:51 - Sam Roberts: Here for now though
29 Jan 20:44 - Tegan: Whattupp y'all?
29 Jan 20:46 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: We're in the same place
29 Jan 20:49 - Tegan: Surely the appeal wears off at 7?

29 Jan 20:50 - Tegan: On my wat5
29 Jan 20:50 - Joe Jarman: It's still cheap!
29 Jan 20:50 - Tegan: Sright

29 Jan 20:58 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: Where there's a will there's a wat5
29 Jan 21:13 - Tegan: WAT5 MOTHERLICKERS
29 Jan 21:14 - Tegan: It's snowing
29 Jan 21:16 - Vinay: Where? Its dry as a baboons backside here
29 Jan 21:16 - Tegan: Kx
29 Jan 21:16 - Vinay: I got all excited
29 Jan 21:16 - Owen: Damn you teegs you made me look out the window.
29 Jan 21:17 - Owen: I was disappointed
29 Jan 21:17 - Vinay: Same
29 Jan 21:17 - Tegan: It won't settle
29 Jan 21:17 - Tegan: It's mainly damp
29 Jan 21:17 - Owen: Watch "Hercules - DISAPPOINTED" on YouTube - Hercules - DISAPPOINTED: http://youtu.be/_O1hM-k3aUY
29 Jan 21:17 - Tegan: Definite snowfall here though
30 Jan 09:32 - Martha: What plans for tonight? I'm in need of a chilled one - I'm thinking good food and films/episodes and a comfy couch. Shabong? Canning t? What say you?
30 Jan 09:35 - Shaggy: Team bonding exercise with work, meaning team bonds with alcohol, somewhere near work
30 Jan 09:35 - Owen: Whatever you do don't be hungover tomorrow Marth
30 Jan 09:36 - Alex Bunn: I'm going to a medieval banquet in st katherines docks
30 Jan 09:36 - Alex Bunn: Its gonna be ossum
30 Jan 09:41 - Tegan: I'm up for an episode of something Marth
30 Jan 09:41 - Tegan: I'm in c town
30 Jan 09:54 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: Someone told me a good comedy film called Chef came out last year, anyone up for that?
30 Jan 11:00 - Martha: Sure, awesome! Teegs - are you heading to Sutton on Saturday morning too? It will make the epic trek from canning t infinitely more enjoyable.
30 Jan 11:07 - Dave: I'd like to see chef - it's downloaded already
30 Jan 11:15 - Owen: 1 hour an epic trek does not make.
30 Jan 11:33 - Martha: Indeed, but 1h27 is getting there.
30 Jan 11:33 - Martha: <Media omitted>
30 Jan 11:34 - Sam Roberts: Uber
30 Jan 11:41 - Tegan: I think I'll have to wend my way home tonight as my laundry situation is pretty dire
30 Jan 11:41 - Tegan: But we can meet at lb or wherever the train goes from
30 Jan 11:52 - Owen: Thats a stupid way to go.
30 Jan 11:52 - Owen: Jubilee to Canada water. Overground to west croydon. Mainline to sutton.
30 Jan 11:53 - Owen: That is the best way. Takes about 1hour if you get the right train.
30 Jan 12:53 - Martha: Aw rats, I thought you and Dave were coming. Owen is there a critical number of people below which we might be forced to drink, eat cake and play Catan?
30 Jan 12:54 - Owen: Teegs is coming. Dave is not
30 Jan 12:55 - Owen: At the moment the list is: marth, teegs, steve, alice, lara, jim, eliza.
30 Jan 12:55 - Owen: So quite a few
30 Jan 13:41 - Lorna: By the way guys, chef is awesome! Comedy that gives you a warm gooey heartwarming feel. With shit loads of food porn. Eat before or line up and epic meat/cheese snack for afters.
30 Jan 14:07 - Alex Bunn: <Media omitted>
30 Jan 18:35 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: OK, so what do you think is the biggest animal by mass that you could have in a fight?
30 Jan 18:36 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: It is trying to kill you
30 Jan 18:36 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: No weapons, MMA octagon stylee
30 Jan 18:36 - Tegan: Could definitely take a cat
30 Jan 18:36 - Tegan: Or cat sized dog
30 Jan 18:36 - Owen: Blue whale.
30 Jan 18:37 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: Land animal
30 Jan 18:37 - Tegan: Probably not a Badger
30 Jan 18:37 - Owen: It's own weight would kill it in an mma octagon
30 Jan 18:39 - Lorna: Could definitely take a giant tortoise. Though its unlikely to ever try and kill me.
30 Jan 18:39 - Martha: Sloth
30 Jan 18:39 - Tegan: Good thinking lorna
30 Jan 18:39 - Tegan: Heavy but slow animals
30 Jan 18:40 - Owen: Maybe a crocodile. They can't open thier jaws if you apply a little force to them. I am not sure how I would kill it though. Maybe finger through the eye to the brain.
30 Jan 18:40 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: You could not even hope to hurt a tortoise though
30 Jan 18:41 - Owen: Kick it in the balls!
30 Jan 18:41 - Owen: No animal can cope with that.
30 Jan 18:41 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: Unless you flip it over and they're well heavy
30 Jan 18:42 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: I feel I could take a giraffe somehow
30 Jan 18:42 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: Would need a good strategy
30 Jan 18:42 - Owen: No way!
30 Jan 18:42 - Martha: I feel that you would find you cant
30 Jan 18:42 - Owen: Have you seen those fuckers fight?
30 Jan 18:43 - Owen: They neck whip each other.
30 Jan 18:43 - Owen: Giraffes are BAD ASS!
30 Jan 18:43 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: You got to trip it over somehow
30 Jan 18:43 - Shaggy: <Media omitted>
30 Jan 18:44 - Lorna: I'd flip that tortoise and elbow drop it. WWF style
30 Jan 18:46 - Tegan: Dang
30 Jan 18:47 - Lorna: Or a panda. Anyone could take a panda
30 Jan 18:49 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: Again, I think it would be tough to harm a panda
30 Jan 18:50 - Tegan: Are you allowed a rope?
30 Jan 18:50 - Alex Bunn: Yeah pandas suck
30 Jan 18:50 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: You'd have to hurt its feelings somehow
30 Jan 18:50 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: No ropes
30 Jan 18:50 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: I reckon a cow is doable
30 Jan 18:51 - Owen: A cow is basically a bull without horns though
30 Jan 18:51 - Tegan: Cows ares pretty solid
30 Jan 18:52 - Tegan: I reckon you could kick a sheep to death
30 Jan 18:52 - Owen: I don't really know how to kill any animal
30 Jan 18:52 - Owen: Except a chicken.
30 Jan 18:52 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: Giraffe you can strangle I reckon
30 Jan 18:52 - Martha: Guys this is pretty dark.
30 Jan 18:52 - Martha: Who started this?
30 Jan 18:52 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: Dave
30 Jan 18:53 - Martha: Mmm really?
30 Jan 18:53 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: Actually I'm continuing a convo from lunch
30 Jan 18:53 - Martha: My bets are on you for some reason
30 Jan 18:53 - Owen: I think you underestimate how big a giraffe's neck is.
30 Jan 18:53 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: It was much darker than this...
30 Jan 18:57 - Tegan: Mike, are you heading back to watch chef tonight?
30 Jan 18:57 - Bongo: A massive capybara
30 Jan 18:58 - Bongo: <Media omitted>
30 Jan 18:59 - Bongo: They're pretty much punching bags
30 Jan 18:59 - Bongo: They weigh a tonne and I bet they're so chilled they'd just let you punch them until they die
30 Jan 19:04 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: Yeah I'm at pub, leaving in 10
30 Jan 19:05 - Tegan: Aiight
30 Jan 19:37 - Dave: I could take an ostrich
30 Jan 19:38 - Martha: There in 30 xxx
30 Jan 19:38 - Dave: Whoop
30 Jan 19:39 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: Roman numeral bants
30 Jan 19:40 - Tegan: Niiice
30 Jan 19:47 - Bongo: I'm bored and ill, anyone want to come entertain me?
30 Jan 19:47 - Bongo: Probably one of the least tempting offers I've ever made but that just shows how extremely ill I am
30 Jan 20:15 - Tegan: Sorry dude - I'm being bored and ill over here
30 Jan 20:16 - Tegan: I would recommend the David Attenborough on the beeb about birds of paradise
30 Jan 20:16 - Tegan: The voice is medicine, and the birds are silly
30 Jan 20:29 - Tegan: Mike
30 Jan 20:29 - Tegan: Bring more wine
30 Jan 20:30 - Tegan: And Yorkshire puddings
30 Jan 20:30 - Tegan: Loads of Yorkshire puddings
30 Jan 20:30 - Dave: Plz
30 Jan 20:39 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: Yorkshire puddings?
30 Jan 20:39 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: Also Dave, are you nuts, an ostrich would kick your face off
30 Jan 20:40 - Dave: Yup x many
30 Jan 20:40 - Dave: Nah mate, I'd dodge it's kick and punch it in the beak
30 Jan 20:40 - Dave: BAM!
30 Jan 20:40 - Joe Jarman: Bongo
30 Jan 20:40 - Joe Jarman: Come here
30 Jan 20:40 - Joe Jarman: And we will look after you
30 Jan 20:40 - Joe Jarman: Ill send an uber
30 Jan 20:41 - Joe Jarman: Got some free credits
30 Jan 20:41 - Dave: Or maybe wrestle it
30 Jan 20:41 - Owen: Dave you can't dodge a balcony how are you gonna dodge an ostrich!?

6 Feb 18:21 - Bongo: On the bus, be there in 5 hours
6 Feb 18:21 - Bongo: Because that's how bloody long it takes to get anywhere on a bus in London
6 Feb 18:22 - Sam Roberts: Bus? You mean the peasant wagon
6 Feb 18:22 - Bongo: Amen
6 Feb 18:23 - Bongo: I bet none of these herberts have even ever tried gold-flecked champagne with their cereal before

7 Feb 08:23 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: Ow my brain üòñ
7 Feb 09:06 - Bongo: Lol I literally saw you passed out on the couch, did you wake up to text that?
7 Feb 09:14 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: Passed out from the overexertion of texting that
7 Feb 09:54 - Bongo: Children of the third world have to walk for 2 hours each day to get fresh water
7 Feb 09:54 - Bongo: But that's nothing compared to the harsh climates that some people live in the uk
7 Feb 09:55 - Bongo: Donate ¬£2 a month to provide mike with a monkey butler so that he doesn't have to waste energy texting
7 Feb 09:56 - Tegan: Can I have a monkey butler for ¬£2 a month?
7 Feb 09:56 - Tegan: I'm not after charity, I'll fund my own
7 Feb 10:02 - Bongo: Hmm yea I want one too
7 Feb 10:03 - Bongo: Screw mike, I'm getting a fleet of monkey butlers
7 Feb 10:03 - Bongo: Fleet is the collective noun for monkey butlers right?

7 Feb 18:17 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: Big hero 6 was class!

7 Feb 21:40 - Sam Roberts: Looks like a dnd wet dream
7 Feb 21:49 - Pete Morey: Basically
10 Feb 14:13 - Bongo: That Strauss Khan sex party story is hilarious
10 Feb 14:13 - Bongo: "Okay I pimped girls at sex parties, but that was only like 12 times"
10 Feb 14:14 - Bongo: And someone else who regularly attended is all like "I was there for professional reasons" lol
10 Feb 15:57 - Owen: Give the guy a break he only had 12 sex parties over the course of 3 years. Thats a 3 month wait between sex parties. I have to wait less time between holidays!
10 Feb 15:58 - Owen: Also he, and I quote: "did it for fun." We can all sympathise with that nobel aim.
10 Feb 16:00 - Tegan: Classy
10 Feb 16:00 - Tegan: He was going to be the head of the IMF a few years ago
10 Feb 16:00 - Tegan: The IMF could use more sex patios
10 Feb 16:00 - Tegan: Parties dammit
10 Feb 16:03 - Owen: They face charges of "aggravated pimping." I know aggravated probably has a legal definition but i cannot stop picturing him as some kind of super pimp with mega chains and a massive furry hat.
10 Feb 16:04 - Owen: Sex patios also sound good teegs
10 Feb 16:11 - Hannah Murphy: Bongo give him some slack - it was 12 parties across three years, so only four a year
10 Feb 16:12 - Owen: Repost!!!
10 Feb 16:40 - Tegan: Who doesn't throw quarterly sex parties?
10 Feb 16:41 - Owen: They sink up with tax day
10 Feb 16:46 - Vanessa: Here's my rant, I can't believe after so many years with the 100ml rule at airport security you STILL get people completely dumbfounded when their shampoo gets taken away
10 Feb 16:47 - Owen: But I am special so surely the rules don't apply to me.
10 Feb 16:48 - Vanessa: Yes, I forgot, it's in the small print
10 Feb 17:08 - Shaggy: Oh I thought it's 100ml only for explosive liquids
10 Feb 17:27 - Tegan: Yup. Only solid explosives in larger quantities.
10 Feb 17:27 - Tegan: Or in they have to be in your checked luggage
10 Feb 18:33 - Bongo: And definitely no alan keys right Sam?
10 Feb 18:33 - Bongo: You terrorist
10 Feb 18:39 - Bongo: 1) who brings an alan key with them on holiday
10 Feb 18:40 - Bongo: 2) why does it get banned from taken on the flight
10 Feb 18:57 - Shaggy: I had bike tools taken away from me as well
10 Feb 20:29 - Sam Roberts: Fascists with their ridiculous rules on bike gear
10 Feb 20:30 - Sam Roberts: Must be to limit bike thefts in India
12 Feb 13:09 - Tegan: <Media omitted>

12 Feb 13:25 - Tegan: All Sri Lanka lacks is a big group of lads

12 Feb 13:43 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: Hitting the big Jesus this eve I think
12 Feb 13:44 - Tegan: Don't hit him
12 Feb 13:44 - Tegan: He had enough stick when he was alive
12 Feb 13:45 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: Yeah and you wouldn't like big Jesus when he's angry
12 Feb 13:46 - Tegan: Damn right
12 Feb 13:46 - Tegan: He is of second coming prop proportions
12 Feb 15:35 - Owen: I live!
12 Feb 15:53 - Owen: I thought I had killed my phone by rooting it. But i hadn't
12 Feb 15:59 - Tegan: Owen!
12 Feb 16:15 - Sam Roberts: Can it do awesome stuff now it's rooted?
12 Feb 16:17 - Owen: I can delete apps that were locked by the OS

12 Feb 16:18 - Sam Roberts: Ah fuck, how easy was it?

12 Feb 18:05 - Henry Dranks: congratulations joeee!
12 Feb 18:05 - Henry Dranks: Did it work owen?
12 Feb 18:33 - Owen: Nah it was too much effort keeping track of everything. It also became a bit distracting because kids would argue for xp.
12 Feb 18:33 - Owen: This looks like it will remove those problems.
12 Feb 19:23 - Bongo: Cool pic, I can forgive it even though it's in paradise
12 Feb 19:23 - Bongo: I might have to lead this group when everyone whips out the carnival pics
12 Feb 19:24 - Owen: Congratulations Joe!!!

12 Feb 20:27 - Joe Jarman: Obviously I didnt
12 Feb 20:32 - Vanessa: I know a couple who actually made up their last name
12 Feb 20:33 - Vanessa: I thought that was pretty original
12 Feb 20:34 - Shaggy: Did they randomly put their names together with a hyphen in between?
12 Feb 20:34 - Vanessa: Nope they actually made a new name using their old names as guidance
12 Feb 20:34 - Vanessa: Gordan and Leech to make Leedon
12 Feb 20:35 - Vanessa: Her husband's mother was not too pleased
12 Feb 20:35 - Shaggy: Anagram contest!

12 Feb 20:39 - Shaggy: Dong is good too
12 Feb 20:39 - Shaggy: Omg, it can be Horde
12 Feb 20:39 - Shaggy: They missed out
12 Feb 20:40 - Shaggy: If I was her husband's mother I would be unhappy too
12 Feb 20:45 - Vanessa: Why? Because they should have gone with Horde?
12 Feb 21:45 - Owen: Bomes or Jott would be ours
13 Feb 01:51 - Tegan: Obvs you should both have taken Liza's name

17 Feb 13:12 - Tegan: Let us know what you neeeed

17 Feb 14:33 - Adam Wills: Can you do this again next week? I'm waiting for my baggage in an airport, and this chat is making me well hungry!

17 Feb 15:04 - Tegan: Roger on the ricotta etc
17 Feb 15:17 - Adam Wills: Just came back to Bangalore from Kashmir... FYI for all snowboarders - Go to gulmarg in Kashmir for a once in a lifetime snowboarding experience... I would be so up for doing that again (sewing a little seed for next season - Feb is the time to do it)
17 Feb 15:17 - Adam Wills: But seriously can you do pancakes again next week??
17 Feb 15:18 - Shaggy: We can definitely have more pancakes, what kind of question is that?

17 Feb 18:45 - Tegan: How many are coming?

17 Feb 18:46 - Martha: Me + teegs + Lorna + shaggy + bongo = 5+...
17 Feb 18:48 - Shaggy: Vinay. Angie made a noise earlier
17 Feb 18:48 - Angela: I did! Just looking at trains from mine now
17 Feb 18:49 - Angela: Is there free parking near yours? Feeling lazy
17 Feb 18:49 - Angela: And what can I bring?
17 Feb 18:53 - Tegan: My only request is lemons
17 Feb 18:53 - Angela: All my trains to elephant are cancelled! What treachery is this!
17 Feb 18:54 - Shaggy: There is but I suspect not free, I will be home shortly and check
17 Feb 18:56 - Angela: Cool thanks, trains are all cancelled til 7.40 and then it says bulletin on the service, whatever that means
17 Feb 19:03 - Shaggy: Yup you can park downstairs
17 Feb 19:04 - Angela: Woohoo! I'll be there in about 30 then, with lemons!
17 Feb 19:11 - Tegan: If anyone is with Dave, could you tell him I plan to leave his key in the gas lockers? Or find out if he had the spares?

17 Feb 19:22 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: Dave has the spares

17 Feb 19:29 - Lorna: Passed him. I'm outside
17 Feb 23:04 - Tegan: Sooooo pancaked

18 Feb 10:37 - Shaggy: Matt Berry: Wildlove
18 Feb 11:45 - Tegan: Research confirms there is no such thing as a carpet pigeon. .. so what was that funky bird?
18 Feb 11:59 - Hannah Murphy: WHAT THE FUCK WAS THAT
18 Feb 18:42 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: Man its really weird to feel cold again
18 Feb 18:42 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: Kind of comforting
18 Feb 18:54 - Sam Roberts: It's nice being back in England in all its drizzly glory
18 Feb 18:56 - Sam Roberts: Well jealous of the pancake chat
18 Feb 19:35 - Bongo: We'll probs have another one next week
18 Feb 19:36 - Bongo: It's a little known fact that there was a second, more popular Saint of pancakes who's favourite topping was beer
18 Feb 19:36 - Bongo: His day is next week
18 Feb 19:39 - Sam Roberts: Ah, the festival of St Beercakes, how could I forget?
18 Feb 19:42 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: He drove all the teetotallers out of Ireland
18 Feb 22:26 - Tegan: Yo, Dave's heading over in the AM to collect his bizniz from C town- he should be there for 8.30
18 Feb 22:27 - Tegan: Can someone let him in?
18 Feb 22:39 - Sam Roberts: Lemme check with Ferenc, else might have to be a smidge earlier

18 Feb 22:45 - Sam Roberts: His number's just coming, if he doesn't answer just give him a call
18 Feb 22:46 - Sam Roberts: One of us will probably be around anyway, swearing about having to leave the house
18 Feb 22:46 - Sam Roberts: Ferenc Fernando.vcf (file attached)
19 Feb 07:31 - Tegan: Dave's phone is bezonked, so he won't be able to phone anyone
19 Feb 07:33 - Tegan: But he is on his way eta 8.25

20 Feb 00:01 - Bongo: "Sometimes people write novels and they just be so wordy and self-absorbed. I am not a fan of books. I would never want a book's autograph. I am a proud non-reader of books" - actual quote of Kanye west
20 Feb 07:56 - Tegan: Books can be wordy

20 Feb 18:42 - Lorna: Not sensing much enthusiasm for drinking tonight...
20 Feb 18:43 - Tegan: Everyone else is lame
20 Feb 18:43 - Tegan: Come boogying!
20 Feb 18:46 - Lorna: Where're you going to be? And when?
20 Feb 18:47 - Tegan: Do you fancy dinner at ours?  I'm around kx now having a beer but we probably don't want to go out til later

20 Feb 23:08 - Dave: What time?

20 Feb 23:11 - Owen: So we will be in London from 10/11ish
20 Feb 23:13 - Dave: In the morning I assume
20 Feb 23:13 - Owen: Yeah
20 Feb 23:13 - Owen: 6:30am
20 Feb 23:13 - Owen: But if we stay home we will just sleep and that will fuck me up for work
20 Feb 23:14 - Krizia: Ahhhhh mexxiiico!  ‚ù§üòçüòçüòç
20 Feb 23:14 - Dave: K - my parents may be down but if not then maybe
20 Feb 23:14 - Krizia: It's it amazing or wwhhhaaaaattttt? ??
20 Feb 23:15 - Krizia: Say Hi to Phil!
20 Feb 23:15 - Krizia: Pretty though to stay awake!!
20 Feb 23:18 - Owen: Phil says hi too
20 Feb 23:19 - Owen: Chinese new year in London is one of the simultaneously best and worst things ever
20 Feb 23:19 - Owen: Its like watching a movie that's so bad it's good.
20 Feb 23:45 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: Hey that new breaking bad show has started!
20 Feb 23:45 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: Better call Saul... Has anyone watched it?
21 Feb 00:00 - Bongo: Yep
21 Feb 00:00 - Bongo: Pretty good
21 Feb 00:01 - Bongo: Not nearly as good as breaking bad
21 Feb 10:12 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: Yeah it's not bad so far
21 Feb 10:13 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: Less funny madcaps than I was expecting
21 Feb 11:21 - Pete Morey: I like it,  s'good...  Basically pre-bb Saul is pre cancer Walt
21 Feb 11:21 - Pete Morey: Same premise + arc,  but it's a good one so worth repeating
21 Feb 11:23 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: I dunno, slip and fall Saul?
21 Feb 11:24 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: He's pretty devious from the start
21 Feb 12:02 - Pete Morey: Yeah true
21 Feb 12:03 - Pete Morey: Slippin Jimmy
21 Feb 12:04 - Pete Morey: I'm shutting up about it now, in case spoilers etc
21 Feb 12:06 - Pete Morey: Random pc question for anyone who might be able to help:
21 Feb 12:09 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: Turn it off and on again
21 Feb 12:11 - Pete Morey: I just bought pc and ssd - I wanna put the os on the ssd but it has come pre loaded on the hdd. No installation disk and any legit online source for installation is an 'update' rather than original install.  Anywhere I can get a windows 8 installation?  Any other suggestions about how to proceed??
21 Feb 12:11 - Pete Morey: Sorry:I tried bashing with a rock already
21 Feb 12:17 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: Are you sure you want windows 8?
21 Feb 12:17 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: I've heard it's weird
21 Feb 12:18 - Pete Morey: Yeah it's weird... Too late now I got it
21 Feb 12:19 - Pete Morey: It tries to turn windows into an app system or smt
21 Feb 12:20 - Pete Morey: It's my cheapest option cos I got a product key with the pc
21 Feb 12:22 - Sam Roberts: We've got a Windows 7 bit usb with a crack somewhere, can use that
21 Feb 12:23 - Sam Roberts: If you're on 8, get the 8.1 update and you can run a proper desktop. All the panel stuff is weak unless you're using it as a touch screen
21 Feb 12:23 - Pete Morey: Yeah?
21 Feb 12:23 - Pete Morey: Or maybe I could transfer 7 from my old laptop
21 Feb 12:23 - Pete Morey: I'm checking that out now
21 Feb 12:24 - Pete Morey: How do I get the 7 windows of ye Sam?
21 Feb 12:28 - Pete Morey: Oh yeah I have 8.1 sorry yeah
21 Feb 12:32 - Sam Roberts: I've got to do mine sometime, Windows party Monday night?
21 Feb 12:34 - Pete Morey: Haha sounds fun.  I might have a solution from my housemate by then,  but YES in principle.  How does a windows party work then?
21 Feb 12:38 - Sam Roberts: You come round about 8, we celebrate everything Windows
21 Feb 12:38 - Sam Roberts: Looking out of them, opening, closing, the LOT
21 Feb 12:39 - Pete Morey: .. Maybe we could put our pc s together in a room/pit and encourage them to kiss
21 Feb 12:39 - Pete Morey: ... And/or fight...
21 Feb 12:40 - Pete Morey: We could take bets
21 Feb 12:40 - Pete Morey: On outcomes etc
21 Feb 12:41 - Pete Morey: Godammit this isn't helping with my OS/Ssd problem at all...
21 Feb 12:43 - Pete Morey: (it takes me two hours to get to canning town btw.  We'd best have the windows party at a decent mid point.  Or mine.)
21 Feb 12:47 - Sam Roberts: <Media omitted>
21 Feb 12:48 - Pete Morey: <Media omitted>
21 Feb 12:49 - Bongo: For some reason I read that as visual communication helps thinking
21 Feb 12:49 - Pete Morey: It does!
21 Feb 12:51 - Pete Morey: .. But maybe not when trying to plan a windows party w sam
21 Feb 12:51 - Pete Morey: Especially in negotiating a venue that isn't Sam's place...
21 Feb 12:57 - Bongo: Yea that sucks just go with 7
21 Feb 13:29 - Shaggy: Sam I think mentioned about some utility that moves windows over? Did you try it last time you messed with your PC? Clean install would be best anyways, your PC probably comes with a bunch of preinstalled bullshit anyway. How big is the ssd?
21 Feb 13:42 - Pete Morey: Oh hey.  Yeah ideally I want clean install but my pc didn't come with install disk
21 Feb 13:43 - Pete Morey: So I got the product key from the pc and am looking for a standard install iso online
21 Feb 13:43 - Pete Morey: Actually,  I would prefer a USB install
21 Feb 13:44 - Pete Morey: Cos I don't have did drive
21 Feb 13:44 - Shaggy: You need to pirate that shit, you won't find one to download
21 Feb 13:44 - Pete Morey: The ssd is 120gigs
21 Feb 13:44 - Shaggy: Ok that's enough for windows
21 Feb 13:44 - Pete Morey: *DVD
21 Feb 13:45 - Pete Morey: Yeah I thought so.  Windows plus Adobe and office programs I hope
21 Feb 13:46 - Pete Morey: Can I not just use a standard install cd as long as I have the product key?
21 Feb 13:46 - Pete Morey: (which is downloadable)
21 Feb 13:47 - Pete Morey: (or I thought it would be)
21 Feb 13:47 - Shaggy: It's not
21 Feb 13:47 - Pete Morey: Wow that's shit
21 Feb 13:47 - Shaggy: Yup
21 Feb 13:48 - Pete Morey: Can I not just use someone else's install cd then?  No crack needed cos I have legit cd key
21 Feb 13:52 - Shaggy: Don't have windows 8, 'm afraid
21 Feb 13:54 - Pete Morey: 8.1?
