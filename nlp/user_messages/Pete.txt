it takes me two hours to get to canning town btw we'd best have the windows party at a decent mid point or mine..it does but maybe not when trying to plan a windows party w sam especially in negotiating a venue that isn't sam's place.oh hey yeah ideally i want clean install but my pc didn't come with install disk so i got the product key from the pc and am looking for a standard install iso online actually i would prefer a usb install cos i don't have did drive.the ssd is gigs.dvd yeah i thought so windows plus adobe and office programs i hope can i not just use a standard install cd

loads of penguins live they kept looking up to see the planes following them with their heads and then falling on their backs apparently penguins can't get up so if your one picked up the soap he'd probably die after being buggered so what's black and white and clean and red all over.wha no way pandas fall out of trees.and they're nearly extinct cos the male panda can't coordinate his winky into

civilisation seeping in to my grubby british pores when i visited ye jim that and the cheese.this could be gd critical side reading to the happiness report ie is it a good thing in itself to bring wellbeing into policy tool territory where once it becomes measurable it becomes malleable both in a good and bad way whatever 'it' is http www theguardian com media may how friendship became tool of powerful.yeah me too.d but highlighting the dangers limits of wellbeing as economic indicator seems important because it is the most easily co opted ie ppl can be duped into following the feel good factor more easily by a political leader who may be pursuing a darker agenda.that's analogous to what the editor of the sun said on tv yesterday about their editorial policy in scotland and england he seemed like quite a calm reasonable and balanced man compared to his headlines which somehow directly supported his general point..yup top priority for gove get rid of those pesky human rights.shhheeeiiittt omw what times za shew got jerk pork grill.ah kwl late showing tonight what's a broskini.o.woo congrats on the job d.yeah don't fuck recruitment agents..ha thanks luvv from
