It is £35 return with a yp railcard and its an hour quicker and more comfy..How far is cate from the train station?. Whats her address?.Ok we will get the train then. See you then..2:30 train from paddington its a deal..No coach. Also was that £26.50 each way?. If so the train is cheaper..2:30 train. No changes. Lets get many train beers!.Ok. You have an hour. How is it going to be close?.Do we need to get you tickets as well?.Relocate. Coach b. Not a quiet carriage. Hurry up f00lz.Thank god you are not the train with him..  [MEDIA] . Yes this poor woman has been talked into painting his nails.. Now he is arguing about her poor painting skills..No. Just shaggy..A bit.Did shaggy get home ok?.Oh god. You will regret that move very soon!.I can see why you might think that is a good idea. But you didn't spend two hours on a train with him..No of course not. I thought you were coming here..Yey!.Does he still have nail polish on?.How very dare you!. I'm joking... I'm joking.But hes adorable!.

What time do we need to leave on the first?.Poundland does haribo....Are we getting trains now? Also what colour is my name on wassap?.I don't know.  Sam said something about trains. I liked the idea of hiring a car, but then again I can't drive and mainly liked the idea of getting drunk with shaggy distracting the driver until we careered into a hedge..Since we can't stay on the first wouldn't it be best for everyone to go by car?.Don't we need at least one car to get us from brocksbursy leminghurst town (or whatever its called) to sam's?.Me and eliza will do the same thing as you sam..Scratch that... we will do the same thang as whoever has the keys to the house..Well add mine and eliza's unicycles and you will have a tricycle.

Any news?.Does that say fuk 2014 or fun 2014?.Fun you hannah!.  EMOJI[1f604] .Rotten tomatoes has American hustle at 95%. So it can't be all bad. Me and liza were thinking of seeing it..Really why? It seems pretty accurate to me. And has a simple easy to understand algorithm..Perhaps you just have terrible taste in films shaggy. Also if it consistently disagrees with you then it is an excellent system, you just need to do the opposite of what it says..Can you give me examples of where it is wrong?.So you have no idea if it is good or bad then?.I generally find it pretty excellent.I think you may be confusing the website with the fruit..Also 57% is very close to fresh. The only problem I have with rotten tomatoes is the binary nature of fresh/rotten.  If you just go by percentage instead it is more accurate..Better than crap. Not as good as great..Shaggy how is your bum hairier than your face?.Less hairy?.That explains a lot.  It also raises many questions..Tbh gravity needed more lizard men..I would guess about 580m. Wow, I was way off :(.I was thinking about it compared to the birj kalifa in dubai. I assumed that the shard would be over half its height easily. Nope!.You are also both way off..Phil has been closest so far..To be fair. The question is ambiguous and the pupil has given a correct answer given the ambiguity..Zero.

Every cloud!.What does hb8 mean phil?.I don't want to alarm you all but I have the makings ofa game better than the demon game..A warning: that film is by lars von trier, his previous films have included a woman cutting off her own genitalia. He is FUCKED UP. So I doubt it will be what you are expecting..Happy birthday Bunndamental particle..More on my new game. It is called cold war conundrum. Also, shaggy, can you add dan to this group please?.The game is coming together.  I have written all the rules. Which weekends are people free?. Btw dan. I have made a new game, a bit like the demon game but shorter and with more spies and moles and tailing and scavenger hunting. It is called cold war conundrum!.Can I email you the rules and get your input before sharing with everyone. You were a great help with the demon game.. Are you danruddick@hotmail.com?.Hey in fact Bunn would you like to do this for your birthday? Part of the game is that it ends up in a pub anyway! A pub in which we could have pub lunch....Saturday?. Whats happening tonight by the way?.Already done dan..The spy game is so good by the way!. I haven't played it yet.  But I think it is better than the demon game..This isn't gaming banter. This is for everyone..Except Sarah. She did not like the demon game.. Yeah but shaggy this is not a video game. This is a game that hopefully everyone will play..

I did not enjoy Monday..We might be late. we missed our train and there are delays on northern line..1!. And 13.. But I'm more interested in 1.. My initial thoughts were that if you had the only house on a street you wouldn't number it, you would name it.. Then I realised that surely for every house number 2 there would be a number 1 so they should at least be equal.. I come to the conclusion that if you own house 1 you are less likely to sell. I have yet to figure out why..Benfords law?.22:15.Oh. Yeah I knew about that, didn't know it was called benfords law. That why I was surprised by the fact that there were fewer 1s than 2s.. Night  night now.  Owen sleeps..Lol? Shaggy just stated a fact why did you lol?.It was good..Martha. I am going to be playing catan with xav all day!.That took a while..I think xav already has it. However we could make 8 player catan with a second expansion..New rule. The people with bikes do not make the decisions about where we go..It stands for comma seperated values. Its a really simple ascii encoding.  Each comma means a new cell and two commas means a new row..Probably. What program generated your csv file teegs?.???.That should work.I'm not sure how it will handle row delimeters though. I don't know or use postges. I just have used csvs a lot in the past..Cool.. So no problem anymore?.Utf8. That should work..I am pretty sure csvs are utf8. Oh yeah.. Odd..Open it in excel and then save with a known encoding..There wouldn't be..Depends. Normally just blank , , sometimes , ,.Yeah.What is on trans_customer line 2?. You might have an invalid charcter or something?.is that the whole table or one of the headings?.Not always shaggy.  It's an option. An option that it doesn't look like it was ticked judging by the notepad screenshot..Try reexporting your csv from excel teegs. Choose a known haracter encoding and tick whatever option it is to put inverted commas around strings. It might be called encapsulate strings..Oh you are right. Excel 2010 doesn't have that..Hmm. I just tried it out and shaggy is right. On newer versions of excel it automatically adds  where necessary..Im home ill anyway..The sum of all the natural numbers is equal to (-1/12). This is crazy! Mathematicians arise and explain!.1+2+3+4.......Why not?.Numberphile sum of natural numbers youtube..There are two proofs.  One of which uses the reimann zeta function..I don't really get what makes a series divegent though. Because 1/1+1/2+1/3 +1/4... is divergent. Even though it feels like it shouldn't be.. Why is it cheating?.That is what they guy did in the video.  He did zeta(2) and then took away 2.zeta (-2) or something.  I forget exactly how he did it. It feels like cheating..Nah. Let the prols that inhabit this thread learn something.. Also apparently 1-1+1-1+1-1.... is divergent.  Which makes no sense!.Physicists have finally figured out why the force of gravity is so weak. Bunns mum stole it all!.is it for doing elevetated sit ups?.I don't know what to do with it.

I heard they have plans to place satchel charges in bagdad while they clutch onto their last tope of freedom.. #bagpuns.Is a sterling a bag?.Thanks for the update..Racist much!?.Sounds foreign, I'll probably have my wallet stolen..Nah I'll just stay at home. I have way too much work to do..Who is lorna that name really rings a bell..Interesting. Apparently like 70% people think farage won the debate according to the guardian.. I personally don't care. I just don't think that in a democracy politicians really have that much power. Gove is trying his best to fuck up education and still isn't really making a dent..What yah gonna do. As long as I don't have to pay for health insurance.. Which I never will. If any politician suggested such a thing there would be a recall election or a vote of no confidence..Sting and The Police!. Blondie. Eric satie. Yes. Rush.I would like to see stats on how much import and export tax is saved by being in the EU.. Also I think the reasons for being part of it are vague and complicated whereas the reasons for not being part basically boil down to saving a small amount of money and stopping immigration.. I am fairly sure I am pro EU not because of its benefits (I don't really know what they are) but because I don't think the arguments against it are compelling. I am basically anti xenophobe. And apparently included in that set is being pro European union..I agree with you. That seems like a pretty small reason. I am fairly sure the EU is actually fairly inconsequential though..Bike pump station..Guys... spoliers....Oh right I thought someone must have died in yesterday's episode. I haven't seen it yet..Sure. See you soon!.Shall we bring booze, food or both?.Sam wtf are you on about? Give me a list of shit to get you pansy!.Will do sam. I shall get 2 sausages. [MEDIA] .

Im suprised they didn't chuck hm back with the rest of the prolls..Who is with sam? Bunn?.How are you using wassap on a plane?.And they haven't let you off the plane with a fault?.Ah. So everything is good then?.Yeah. That's a pain. I meant its good your whole trip didn't have to get cancelled..Police? What?. Are you sure you are taking a ryanair to budapest and not a somalian pirate ship to egypt?.Oh thats nowhere near as exciting as I would expect from a shaggy and the police incident..Who is going to petes thing tonight?.I'm soon to arrive, when will you be getting there?.We at there bihatch!!.OJ and EB inbound!.Eta: 4.

Eliza will send an email to the cates and marthas of the world who don't wassap..Yeah shaggy it really doesn't sound like mikes type of thing. We will leave him off the list..Really.

She destroys small villages!.I'm the same mike..Eliza keeps trying to tell me its a bad film but we always come back to its one redeaming feature.  It has godzilla in it.
