by someone i completely took for granted all these years.i agree i think at least for no.while they weight the results for sampling they can't weight them for people lying all the polls in predicted a labour win but it turned out that voting conservative was so uncool that people just didn't want to admit to it.probably voting no is seen as boring but actually people do want the safer option.happy

please find a way to write about that in your exam.there's a theory that says when you learn another language you hear a word regularly without taking it in it for ages and then one day when your ability gets good enough you suddenly 'notice' it and either understand it through context or you look it up or whatever then after that you notice it every time it's said because you know it's there which is spooky if it's also true in english cos it means you're just deaf to this word for years but it's actually been there all along.it's the rd most popular phrase in the horde didn't you see mike's analysis.why did it make you angry teegs.getting old to the point where that becomes apparent is rubbish no longer do i have potential i had so much potential.my cat just got so confused about
