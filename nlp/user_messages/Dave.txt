eh.heading to pub mins.this is sad news mondays are an event woth got if we just download it all then it will all be spent in a few days and forgotten rather than being a joy of spring and summer i think we should all agree to only download one a week.glad it's only a few i also wager joe is all over this.yay...too soon.i heard if you put an egg on an egg it makes it eggier.one a week.you'll need a bbq or equivalent delight.this is great.i think lib dems may be in for a rough ride this time shagz.lol.to be fair there's about a bn pound divide between their spending plans as labour don't include capital expenditure dustball comment.essentially it's investment so anything outside of the day to day operating costs of the various departments so it would be money for building roads houses schools and statues of keynes chf not under a labour government.it means they can talk about balancing the books and still have money for investment it's a lot easier to argue for borrowing for investment than for operating costs.you happy with the capital expenditure point now o good.not sure i follow the last point lab have said they will balance the current account so you can't fiddle it with the capital account on why the two are different arguably capital investments will bring a return to the country and which will be commensurate in the long term with the borrowing costs now i would argue that the same is true of spending on social services etc but the argument is more controversial.you have to borrow for major infrastructure projects you can't do it on tax revenues.i don't see why current and capital spending are very different currebt expenditure is like paying for food one can argue that unless you are starving you shouldn't spend more on food than you earn capital spending is like buying a house it's silly to save up for one you borrow what you can afford idealogically there is a distinction between getting rid of a deficit which if based on all spending and one based on current spending it's not just a way of massaging figures.indeed it's a secured loan.although the government can't just sell thw m or could they.indeed.agree.would you accept a tax rise rather than a cut under that logic.the amount of tax due from corporates but unclaimed would kill the deficit.i may have slightly overstated my last point need to check the figures but certainly it would put a fair dent in it.a report i just found estimates in bn in lost tax bn from avoidance bn avoidance and bn tax not paid.is evasion ie illegal avoidance through loopholes.wales got a pretty bad deal during devolution compared to scotland.hmm need to check thoae numbers take account of rhe effects of devolution i heard scotland had more spending per head than england.bbc quoting the treasury states scotland has per head wales just under and england has in.there's a measure called gva groas value added which measures how much regions add to gdp england had per head and scotland in according to the ons wikipedia gives numbers as and respectively i am data today.who bongo or bongo.ace see you there x.still there.disturbing.sam looks like a cheap avatar.looks pretty normal to me what's up with it.oh right the mexicans wrestling.hype.regents park would make sense then.great..that sounds cool would love to see it is deckard a replicant you may learn tonight.how much are tickets.hmm i was planning on having a night in spanking the drum if you know what i mean.like a painful fart.pretty sure they're bitching about you anyway mikr mike.god.it's such a bland quote too she's clearly not tried to achieve creative prowess or just not worked very hard on it.i'm good value for manly..hype.man let get going as soon as it hits.¤₩¥¥£¥£₩☆☆☆☆《》《》¤¤¤¤.he's being raped in that

with saying i was a hypnotist.both.shaz and marth are you in c town tonight i have gifts.true should have been shagz shaz on the weekends in his sequin dress.i will also bring crisps.can you save me a veggie space on the bbq plz.eep.owen central station has free pool cheap beer and a downstairs dungeon simmons bar is nice but small has good drinks offers til or.backpackers is cheap has a roof garden often friendly people there ha sam knows more about what happens down there than me.just watched a ukip mep mess up his speech at the european parliament he ended by saying yes to the eu no to the uk then had to correct himself owen and v hausmann's bookshop is also a great kings x shop.what's the split between subsidies and externalities.shaggy externalities are costs or benefits which are not accounted for in the market price of a good so the polluting effect of a car would not usually factor into it's price but is a cost to the environment this cost can be internalised by adding a tax to the car in terms of how green it is or alterntively it can be culturally internalised by making owning green cars desirable.dungeon.uhuh.lol too long watching the woodpecker.too easy.i could beer depends where.i heard it's quite hard going not much happens..happy hobo.it could only be rutger hauer..our train has been cancelled so we won't arrive until soz x.how about glue.only for the

wee.i think they need to establish that it was missold in each case my dad got asked lots of questions when he applied.he did tbh i don't think it's that hard.our economic department are always keen to point out that ppi compensation has been so large £bn that it has probably had a macroeconomic effect on the uk economy.well a lot of the money was taken from the borrowers pre recession and the returned as a lump sum post recession in that sense it was a significant fiscal stimulus although it is true that there was also a drain from the economy to 'fund' it but over a longer time.injecting bn into the economy is surely a stimulus although you could say it's like giving someone a long relaxing massage then injecting them with adrenaline..this is nerdgasm fare i think.what's boring about major redress schemes being viewed as fiscal stimuli oh god.wow and you stayed for the second half.lol.ha.happy birthday shagster.thanks all sorry to be late the oxford canal is treacherous and slow
