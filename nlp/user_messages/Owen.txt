wassap.i don't know sam said something about trains i liked the idea of hiring a car but then again i can't drive and mainly liked the idea of getting drunk with shaggy distracting the driver until we careered into a hedge.since we can't stay on the first wouldn't it be best for everyone to go by car.don't we need at least one car to get us from brocksbursy leminghurst town or whatever its called to sam's.me and eliza will do the same thing as you sam.scratch that we will do the same thang as whoever has the keys to the house.well add mine and eliza's unicycles and you will have a tricycle

this morning was not any news.does that say fuk or fun.fun you hannah.rotten tomatoes has american hustle at so it can't be all bad me and liza were thinking of seeing it.really why it seems pretty accurate to me and has a simple easy to understand algorithm.perhaps you just have terrible taste in films shaggy also if it consistently disagrees with you then it is an excellent system you just need to do the opposite of what it says.can you give me examples of where it is wrong.so you have no idea if it is good or bad then.i generally find it pretty excellent.i think you may be confusing the website with the fruit.also is very close to fresh the only problem i have with rotten tomatoes is the binary nature of fresh rotten if you just go by percentage instead it is more accurate.better than crap not as good as great.shaggy how is your bum hairier than your face.less hairy.that explains a lot it also raises many questions.tbh gravity needed more lizard men.i would guess about m wow i was way off.i was thinking about it compared to the birj kalifa in dubai i assumed that the shard would be over half its height easily nope.you are also both way off.phil has been closest so far.to be fair the question is ambiguous and the pupil has given a correct answer given the ambiguity.zero because that answer is awesome.jesus christ guys how could you leave out elevenses.between brunch and half lunch.but hannah asked a serious question you don't answer those v.thank you for supporting me in my decision to be an idiot dear wife.i like how the cat has a mousetash hehe mouse tash because

not be wearing clothes.actually i made a mistake also i did manage to put some boxers on before leaving i also got a game of leagues in while waiting for eliza this is not the reason we are late honest i got kills though every cloud.what does hb mean phil.i don't want to alarm you all but i have the makings ofa game better than the demon game.a warning that film is by lars von trier his previous films have included a woman cutting off her own genitalia he is fucked up so i doubt it will be what you are expecting.happy birthday bunndamental particle.more on my new game it is called cold war conundrum also shaggy can you add dan to this group please.the game is coming together i have written all the rules which weekends are people free btw dan i have made a new game a bit like the demon game but shorter and with more spies and moles and tailing and scavenger hunting it is called cold war conundrum.can i email you the rules and get your input before sharing with everyone you were a great help with the demon game are you danruddick hotmail com.hey in fact bunn would you like to do this for your birthday part of the game is that it ends up in a pub anyway a pub in which we could have pub lunch.saturday whats happening tonight by the way.already done dan.the spy game is so good by the way i haven't played it yet but i think it is better than the demon game.this isn't gaming banter this is for everyone.except sarah she did not like the demon game yeah but shaggy this is not a video game this is a game that hopefully everyone will play also cold war conundrum does not contain the word spy or the word game.ok what topics are allowed in this group then baas.dude hackney wick is the worst place to get to we will be there but we will be angry and possibly late.gr.the overground isn't running to hackney wick how mike.looking at the tube map hackney wick is all on its own.it stops on minutes in not all the overground just the stratford line.cool jazz improves things.the guy at the station reckons that trains are running so we are going to try.turns out the trains are fine stupid tfl lying to me.good timing on your birthday bunn i am fairly sure i wouldn't have made it in tomorrow if it wasn't half term hashtag drunk....me and eliza are in london doing arty stuff anyone up for the pub later once you finish work.❄  where in old street.ok that

ut the grass is still wet.i ate an entire pack of ham and a loaf of bread so no thank you.where are you moving from where to what do you need.date is it a weekend i will help carry if it is also if you still need a place aftet fran l i am sure me an eliza will be able to sort you out after..batshag ew.what were all of you doing last night and why would you get that smashed on a weekday night hangovers on sunday are fine a work day hangover is terrible i did not enjoy monday.we might be late we missed our train and there are delays on northern line.and but i'm more interested in my initial thoughts were that if you had the only house on a street you wouldn't number it you would name it then i realised that surely for every house number there would be a number so they should at least be equal i come to the conclusion that if you own house you are less likely to sell i have yet to figure out why.benfords law..oh yeah i knew about that didn't know it was called benfords law that why i was surprised by the fact that there were fewer s than s night night now owen sleeps.lol shaggy just stated a fact why did you lol.it was good.martha i am going to be playing catan with xav all day.that took a while.i think xav already has it however we could make player catan with a second expansion.new rule the people with bikes do not make the decisions about where we go.it stands for comma seperated values its a really simple ascii encoding each comma means a new cell and two commas means a new row.probably what program generated your csv file teegs..that should work.i'm not sure how it will handle row delimeters though i don't know or use postges i just have used csvs a lot in the past.cool so no problem anymore.utf that should work.i am pretty sure csvs are utf oh yeah odd.open it in excel and then save with a known encoding.there wouldn't be.depends normally just blank sometimes.yeah.what is on trans customer line you might have an invalid charcter or something.is that the whole table or one of the headings.not always shaggy it's an option an option that it doesn't look like it was ticked judging by the notepad screenshot.try reexporting your csv from excel teegs choose a known haracter encoding and tick whatever option it is to put inverted commas around strings it might be called encapsulate strings.oh you are right excel doesn't have that.hmm i just tried it out and shaggy is right on newer versions of excel it automatically adds where necessary.im home ill anyway.the sum of all the natural numbers is equal to this is crazy mathematicians arise and explain..why not.numberphile sum of natural numbers youtube.there are two proofs one of which uses the reimann zeta function.i don't really get what makes a series divegent though because is divergent even though it feels like it shouldn't be why is it cheating.that is what they guy did in the video he did zeta and then took away zeta or something i forget exactly how he did it it feels like cheating.nah let the prols that inhabit this thread learn something also apparently is divergent which makes no sense.physicists have finally figured out why the force of gravity is so weak bunns mum stole it all.is it for doing elevetated sit ups.i don't know what to do with it the comments for your business and leisure facilities including any files transmitted is a big problem.i snesw a uperiseing.fo al teaa fo al.when is it.nice i heard they have plans to place satchel charges in bagdad while they clutch onto their last tope of freedom bagpuns.is a sterling a bag.thanks for the update.racist much.sounds foreign i'll probably have my wallet stolen.nah i'll just stay at home i have way too much work to do.who is lorna that name really rings a bell.interesting apparently like people think farage won the debate according to the guardian i personally don't care i just don't think that in a democracy politicians really have that much power gove is trying his best to fuck up education and still isn't really making a dent.what yah gonna do as long as i don't have to pay for health insurance which i never will if any politician suggested such a thing there would be a recall election or a vote of no confidence.sting and the police blondie eric satie yes rush.i would like to see stats on how much import and export tax is saved by being in the eu also i think the reasons for being part of it are vague and complicated whereas the reasons for not being part basically boil down to saving a small amount of money and stopping immigration i am fairly sure i am pro eu not because of its benefits i don't really know what they are but because i don't think the arguments against it are compelling i am basically anti xenophobe and apparently included in that set is being pro european union.i agree with you that seems like a pretty small reason i am fairly sure the eu is actually fairly inconsequential though.bike pump station.guys spoliers.oh right i thought someone must have died in yesterday's episode i haven't seen it yet.sure see you soon.shall we bring booze food or both.sam wtf are you on about give me a list of shit to get you pansy.will do sam i shall get

alberton dj pad things i'd like to play around a bit as i'm contemplating asking for some of the setup for my birthday.do you.two girls one plane.two girls on a plane vomiting and freaking out.can you make a plane wassap or something this is not tits or beer.i havr no idea what is going on aren't you right next to each other were you on seperate planes.sam travelling first class im suprised they didn't chuck hm back with the rest of the prolls.who is with sam bunn.how are you using wassap on a plane.and they haven't let you off the plane with a fault.ah so everything is good then.yeah that's a pain i meant its good your whole trip didn't have to get cancelled.police what are you sure you are taking a ryanair to budapest and not a somalian pirate ship to egypt.oh thats nowhere near as exciting as i would expect from a shaggy and the police incident.who is going to petes thing tonight.i'm soon to arrive when will you be getting there.we at there bihatch.oj and eb inbound.eta i'm pretty sure that it starts counting as an industrial paint stipper once it gets to that high percentage it's only but.i recognise that sign you are on a west coast train.damn.oh by the way godzilla at imax on the th may for my birthday which is on the th followed by drinks at the bfi bar which does amazong whisky sours.i have not booked i probably should though.imax sunday.yeah thats the plan eliza will send an email to the cates and marthas of the world who don't wassap.yeah shaggy it really doesn't sound like mikes type of thing we will leave him off the list.really i thought mike hated godzilla thats why we didn't het him a ticket.you doing dough as well.what about bongoloid.big deal my aunt is that bionic lazer eye cat.nope she destroys small villages.i'm the same mike.eliza keeps trying to tell me its a bad film but we always come back to its one redeaming feature it has godzilla in it seriously godzilla adds about the same amount to a film as a film being the film taxi driver adds to a film dan it had gozilla in it therefore it was great.swype increases speed by but you end up having to explain more than half your mesages so it saves no time in the long run.happy birthday to you happy birthday to you happy birthday dear o oh wait yey its my birthday thank you guys.eww girls shaggy.next week will definitely be better because me and eliza will be there.mother of god.i know double bill with double gore and double boobs resulting in eight times as much game of thrones.schadenfreude.night night everyone hope you are all ok there seems to have been a dearth of activity on our usually clattering hoard.but owen jones is allowed in there.hmmm how do i convince my boss that this is work related.i don't understand it but it looks amazing.its less that a pint a pint lasts about minutes you will play this game more than minutes.it is pete's birthday today as well.i thought henry was having his thing tomorrow or maybe that is sarah so many things to keep track of.yeah i

right here.god damn you sam you sneaky bastard i just figured out why my phone keyboard was behaving so weirdly.it was some very subtle trolling sam i kept just thinking my fingers had got fatter or something yeah once you get to the second series it is a lot better the first series just try to copy the british one but because they are american they don't seem to get the humor.so it turns out that although your bosses seem to not want you taking a shit or wearing headphones they are perfectly happy with you spending the day on wassap.you could get noise cancelling headphones and play that silent john cage symphony teens tees oh ffs sam godamn you my autocorrect has forgotten all the words teegs.hmm i might stop by on my way home i just left oxford.ok me and eliza are on our way we will be there about ish maybe teegs that reminds me about godzilla money.someone suggest a good album that me owen will like.i'm at south bank where are peeps also those album recommendations were rubbish i ended up having to listen to the john cage silent symphony.we are on our way.mike you should do stats on who comments most and who gets mentioned most then do the ratio of the two then we could finally have what we all have been waiting for an objective measure of who is the most popular.no henry i think the person who doesn't comment much but gets mentioned a lot has the highest comment efficacy and therefore is the objectively best person.shaggy that link doesn't work for me who is it.owen owen owen owen owen owen owen.ah man i would have bet on myself i better up the ante.don't worry i am sure the quality will also improve.they call that the pre owe nice era i hate sam so much let me make my amazing joke again that should have said they call that period of time the preowenic
