you incorporate comment counts then prolific commenters would feature better and yoid have to take into account time spent in the group too.i think thats an assumption that needs testing before you can claim objectivity.plus tegs makes a good point how does it take into account sentiment.i wonder what the stats would be for proportion of whatsapping done on fridays.would be quite interesting to do a sentiment analysis by day too bet were all happier on fridays.im saving myself for having money to eat.so me and kate just watched got abd its rather good this week.haha hahaha dont worry just
