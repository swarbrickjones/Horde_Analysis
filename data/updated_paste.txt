12:13, 11 Oct 2013 - Dave Mendez: Ah, how about on the Tuesday? Anyone...
12:14, 11 Oct 2013 - Bunn: Hi Dave. Not really a big fan of Stewart Lees rants. I guess i'm not his audience
12:15, 11 Oct 2013 - Bunn: Unless you can change my mind
12:16, 11 Oct 2013 - Slam: Don't think I've seen any of his biz, I love standup though,  I'll geek up a bit this weekend n maybe get a ticket!
12:16, 11 Oct 2013 - Bunn: Its not your typical standup! (There are no jokes)
12:19, 11 Oct 2013 - Dave Mendez: Hmm, I see what you mean. I find that Stewart Lee is like good horror, the comedy is often in what he doesn't say and how you fill it in. He's very theatrical but bit in a camp way and he's true to his comic roots and honest. I think he's really funny. But that's just me... X
12:20, 11 Oct 2013 - Bunn: We'll watch some tonight a la casa and decide
12:22, 11 Oct 2013 - Dave Mendez: That seems fair. Let me know your conclusions. X

12:25, 11 Oct 2013 - Bunn: Ps. Shaggy add bongo!
12:25, 11 Oct 2013 - Bunn: So we can rinse him
12:31, 11 Oct 2013 - Dave Mendez: Mike will advise. His episodes 'Stewart Lee's comedy vehicle' are good and his show If You Prefer A Milder Comedian Please Ask For One is great, especially the cider part at the end. X
12:42, 11 Oct 2013 - Shaggy Crazy Horse: I've seen his show where he talks about Cameron, I think it was funny, if a bit odd, but I also think that most his humour was lost on my ignorant self
12:43, 11 Oct 2013 - Bunn: I think it takes a while to 'get' him
12:47, 11 Oct 2013 - p tschismarov: His show about cameron was weak sauce no matter how long you watched it. Maybe his other stuff is better though.
12:58, 11 Oct 2013 - Bunn: Dayum. Sexy Spanish girl in pret just gave me a badass wink and grin
12:58, 11 Oct 2013 - Bunn: Awww yeah

22:27, 28 Dec 2013 - Bunn: Need to start asking around for md
22:28, 28 Dec 2013 - Bunn: Do we need to worry/make preparations for the storm thats coming in?
22:36, 28 Dec 2013 - Dave Mendez: I'll bring ropes for tying down the house. What would you do without me?
22:39, 28 Dec 2013 - Teegan: Is Shaggy at all enlightened?
22:39, 28 Dec 2013 - Slam: I'd panic dave. Panic and lose my house
22:52, 28 Dec 2013 - Vanessa "Beast" Matthews: Storm? Again?
22:53, 28 Dec 2013 - Bunn: Appaz. Although i havnt seen any news or weather and im going on rumours
22:54, 28 Dec 2013 - Vanessa "Beast" Matthews: Appaz? Is that the name of it?
22:57, 28 Dec 2013 - Bunn: Lol. I meant apparently but i shortened it cos im totes amaze
23:03, 28 Dec 2013 - Teegan: Might bugger up the trains
23:03, 28 Dec 2013 - Teegan: Sorry, bug up the trs
23:29, 28 Dec 2013 - Slam: Bgr p th trns
23:29, 28 Dec 2013 - Slam: I got that first time bunn
23:31, 28 Dec 2013 - Bunn: Thats cos ur cool
23:35, 28 Dec 2013 - Slam: I don't know if it's cool or if we've spent so long living together that our menstrual cycles wre in line
23:55, 28 Dec 2013 - Bunn: I can believe that
23:55, 28 Dec 2013 - Bunn: But according to Spaced. Men are supposed to have this unspoken understanding of how to act out a gunfight
23:55, 28 Dec 2013 - Bunn: Which is a bit cooler than syncronised bleeding
09:56, 29 Dec 2013 - p tschismarov: If a gunfight erupts I'll use you as a human shield and then sell your remains to a cat food company.
10:03, 29 Dec 2013 - Bunn: Good to know you're on my side
10:03, 29 Dec 2013 - Bunn: Sneaky Austrian
10:03, 29 Dec 2013 - Bunn: Aren't you supposed to go Arnie?
10:04, 29 Dec 2013 - Bunn: And stand solo with a minigun in the heart of battle
10:04, 29 Dec 2013 - Bunn: And destroy everything in sight?
11:58, 29 Dec 2013 - Owen James: Are we getting trains now? Also what colour is my name on wassap?
13:12, 29 Dec 2013 - Cate: Brown. What's the closest station?
13:15, 29 Dec 2013 - Owen James: I don't know.  Sam said something about trains. I liked the idea of hiring a car, but then again I can't drive and mainly liked the idea of getting drunk with shaggy distracting the driver until we careered into a hedge.
13:20, 29 Dec 2013 - Slam: One car and some people on trains, I think you were down for car-ing?
13:24, 29 Dec 2013 - Dave Mendez: Car would be great if there are people happy to drive. Phil, are you still game? X
13:28, 29 Dec 2013 - Owen James: Since we can't stay on the first wouldn't it be best for everyone to go by car?
13:47, 29 Dec 2013 - Cate: Owen makes a lot of sense. Also Sam, what train station would we go to?
13:49, 29 Dec 2013 - Dave Mendez: Last time we went to brokenhurst broklesby
13:49, 29 Dec 2013 - Cate: Seriously?!
13:49, 29 Dec 2013 - Dave Mendez: Brockenhurst even
13:49, 29 Dec 2013 - Cate: That place name like my name!!
13:50, 29 Dec 2013 - Cate: No. No it isn't. As you were...
13:50, 29 Dec 2013 - Dave Mendez: Heh, too much excitment
13:50, 29 Dec 2013 - Dave Mendez: Are you training or carrying cate?
13:51, 29 Dec 2013 - Dave Mendez: Urg, carring
13:55, 29 Dec 2013 - Slam: Could get two cars, I'd prefer train though tbh, trains are fine on the 1st, about 2 hours to waterloo every half hour. Cars a bit cheaper, trains are nicer
14:03, 29 Dec 2013 - Bunn: What was the price for two cars? Did tegan look into that last time? I can drive
14:04, 29 Dec 2013 - Bunn: Also. We have accumulated two bags of unidentified clothing in our house. If you think you might own some of these items please come and pick them up before i chuck them out in a couple of weeks time
14:24, 29 Dec 2013 - Dave Mendez: Marth reckoned that two cars with four in each would be around 34 quid each.
14:24, 29 Dec 2013 - Dave Mendez: How many are going?
14:33, 29 Dec 2013 - Slam: 13 I think, 7 seater an option?
14:41, 29 Dec 2013 - Dave Mendez: Could get a couple of 7s. Marth worked it out as 46 each that way.
14:50, 29 Dec 2013 - Vanessa "Beast" Matthews: I'm already training it. The station in arriving at is called Lymington Town. Is that right Sam?
14:51, 29 Dec 2013 - Vanessa "Beast" Matthews: Bunny is there a dark red herringbone bomber jacket in there?
15:04, 29 Dec 2013 - Owen James: Don't we need at least one car to get us from brocksbursy leminghurst town (or whatever its called) to sam's?
15:04, 29 Dec 2013 - Dave Mendez: Could taxi
15:08, 29 Dec 2013 - Vanessa "Beast" Matthews: I'm arriving at around 10pm so I'll figure it out when I get there
15:20, 29 Dec 2013 - Slam: Probably taxi for v then, which leaves a 7 and a 5, or a 7 and 5 by train
15:20, 29 Dec 2013 - Slam: Def need one car, mainly for ease / booze runs / flexibility
15:21, 29 Dec 2013 - Slam: Station is lymington, or Brockenhurst. Brock is a bit further but easier trains, lymington is 1 more change
15:22, 29 Dec 2013 - Slam: So depends on whether whoever's driving is up for a slightly longer pickup *lascivious wink at marth*
15:23, 29 Dec 2013 - Owen James: Me and eliza will do the same thing as you sam.
15:24, 29 Dec 2013 - Slam: Awesome sauce, we can plan pranks to play on Bunny
15:24, 29 Dec 2013 - Dave Mendez: You're walking aren't you Sam?
15:24, 29 Dec 2013 - Owen James: Scratch that... we will do the same thang as whoever has the keys to the house.
15:24, 29 Dec 2013 - Slam: I bought a unicycle just for this!
15:25, 29 Dec 2013 - Owen James: Well add mine and eliza's unicycles and you will have a tricycle.  Just like a grown up little boy.
15:28, 29 Dec 2013 - Shaggy Crazy Horse: Wazzzzuuuuuuuuuuiuup
15:29, 29 Dec 2013 - Slam: Sup
15:30, 29 Dec 2013 - Owen James: Hi shaggy.
15:30, 29 Dec 2013 - Slam: So I think we should stick to the e-list
15:30, 29 Dec 2013 - Owen James: ??
15:30, 29 Dec 2013 - Owen James: Elist?
15:30, 29 Dec 2013 - Slam: Car: teeg n dave, shag marth, pton and oliza
15:31, 29 Dec 2013 - Slam: Leaves bunn, cate, rob, V and me by train / taxi

15:32, 29 Dec 2013 - Owen James: 7 peeps.
15:32, 29 Dec 2013 - Owen James: If we get there early is there a pub?
15:32, 29 Dec 2013 - Owen James: Sounds good.
15:36, 29 Dec 2013 - Shaggy Crazy Horse: There is
15:36, 29 Dec 2013 - Shaggy Crazy Horse: And I know where
15:37, 29 Dec 2013 - Owen James: What style of shoes do you like shaggy?
15:37, 29 Dec 2013 - Shaggy Crazy Horse: Skate shoes
15:38, 29 Dec 2013 - Dave Mendez: Sounds good. I'm out of work at 1230. What time are we leaving?
15:38, 29 Dec 2013 - Shaggy Crazy Horse: I'm free all day
15:38, 29 Dec 2013 - Owen James: Do you like stilettos?
15:39, 29 Dec 2013 - Owen James: Me too
15:39, 29 Dec 2013 - Shaggy Crazy Horse: Not for myself, but yes
15:53, 29 Dec 2013 - Slam: There's a good pub across the road and a great pub 5 mins drive away
18:27, 29 Dec 2013 - Marth: Can't be arsed to read 153 new whatsapp messages. What's up folks?
18:27, 29 Dec 2013 - Marth: Big festive love to you all from Xav & me in Brussels xx
18:29, 29 Dec 2013 - Dave Mendez: There's a car crew and a train crew. These are mentioned about 10 messages ago. Can only stay until the 1st. Gonna be playing with cards. Need booze. X
18:33, 29 Dec 2013 - Bunn: And drugs would be nice
19:30, 29 Dec 2013 - Owen James: Anyone know where to get some hallucinogens? Mushrooms or summat?
20:51, 29 Dec 2013 - Bunn: Still asking around
22:11, 29 Dec 2013 - Dave Mendez: Tegs and I are thinking of training down if it's just gonna be one 7 seater car.
22:23, 29 Dec 2013 - Bongo: Just catching up on these messages, is everyone heading down tomorrow or tues?
22:59, 29 Dec 2013 - Slam: 31st, guess that's Tuesday
23:00, 29 Dec 2013 - Slam: That leaves 2 seats in the car? Also can team shagmarth be in charge of sorting that out?
23:07, 29 Dec 2013 - Bongo: I guess I'll train it down with you lot in the day then.
23:07, 29 Dec 2013 - Bongo: Those clothes are mine btw, I'll take them off your hands next time I'm round.
11:58, 30 Dec 2013 - Shaggy Crazy Horse: Why is there a train crew if we all have to be back at the same time? All in car makes more sense
11:59, 30 Dec 2013 - Cate: I would rather go by car, is there room in a car for me? X
11:59, 30 Dec 2013 - Shaggy Crazy Horse: And it's an aweful long way to go for one night anyway. Just sayin
12:00, 30 Dec 2013 - Cate: Let's go todaaay!
12:04, 30 Dec 2013 - Bunn: Just come here Cate if you're bored today
12:11, 30 Dec 2013 - Bunn: Its miserable outside today :(
12:18, 30 Dec 2013 - Vanessa "Beast" Matthews: Perfect day for hot choco and baileys
12:19, 30 Dec 2013 - Dave Mendez: At work :(
12:42, 30 Dec 2013 - Bunn: Gonna throw this (potentially) controversial suggestion out there
12:42, 30 Dec 2013 - Bunn: NYE at Croydon Road?
12:44, 30 Dec 2013 - Slam: I'm easy,  anywhere with all you beautiful people and some tunes is good for me
12:45, 30 Dec 2013 - Slam: Ideally some naughty salts as well, anyone got some thoughts on that
12:45, 30 Dec 2013 - Slam: ?
12:48, 30 Dec 2013 - Dave Mendez: I guess that it is a bit of a mission if we're off the next day. Would have been great to see the sea though.
12:49, 30 Dec 2013 - Shaggy Crazy Horse: In this weather you might as well squint your eyes and look at the ripples on the puddles in our garden
12:50, 30 Dec 2013 - Dave Mendez: Heh, perhaps I can take a trip out on your garden boat.
12:50, 30 Dec 2013 - Teegan: Point taken- it's not really the weather for a walk.  Let's visit the sea in the spring time.
12:50, 30 Dec 2013 - Slam: You'll have to fight the foxes first
12:52, 30 Dec 2013 - Slam: Thinking about food and people, phil / marth, you know some roast stuff we can have cold? Like, do a ham in the morning maybe?
12:52, 30 Dec 2013 - Slam: And can you do veggies for the veggies dave?
12:53, 30 Dec 2013 - Dave Mendez: Roast red peppers are great cold
12:53, 30 Dec 2013 - Bunn: Ok this seems to be gathering momentum. Lets see what everyone else says. What would have been spent on travel can be spent on more food
12:54, 30 Dec 2013 - Bunn: Vanessa will be reimbursed cos she's already bought a train ticket
12:55, 30 Dec 2013 - Vanessa "Beast" Matthews: I've also got a bottle of vodka and rum ready to be cracked open!
12:55, 30 Dec 2013 - Slam: I feel pretty good about this actually, bantsmas was awesome
12:56, 30 Dec 2013 - Dave Mendez: Agreed, though she should try and get a refund if possible.
13:09, 30 Dec 2013 - Vanessa "Beast" Matthews: It wasn't a lot so don't worry about it
13:10, 30 Dec 2013 - Dave Mendez: I'm happy to chip in V. Also very happy to help with food.
13:10, 30 Dec 2013 - Vanessa "Beast" Matthews: Teaches me a lesson for being too organised
13:13, 30 Dec 2013 - Cate: :/
13:15, 30 Dec 2013 - Shaggy Crazy Horse: Not sure it's one of those things in life that you need a lesson for, but yes, your fault
13:16, 30 Dec 2013 - Vanessa "Beast" Matthews: Thanks mom
13:16, 30 Dec 2013 - Dave Mendez: Is anyone not up for relocation to c town?
13:35, 30 Dec 2013 - Eliza Botts: Owen and I are fine either way.
16:06, 30 Dec 2013 - Marth: Damn, seriously? I agree, a lot cheaper, but cottage last year was sooooo epic
16:08, 30 Dec 2013 - Slam: Agreed but I'd say cos of the people, not the place
16:17, 30 Dec 2013 - Marth: 7 reasons why: (1) disco room, separated with a curtain from (2) awesome chill out room with more sofas than a room ever needs pushed into a circle, with (3) disco lights. (4) a kitchen with a table we sit and play cards around and eat around that's not covered with crap. (5) a garden to chill out in intermittently throughout the evening, where we're less likely to get stabbed, and (6) a clean, comfy bed with fresh sheets to lay your head on when the sun is rising and your body is blissfully fragile. And (7) the coast of England to enjoy with close friends and a glass of orange juice on New Year's Day. Yay?
16:23, 30 Dec 2013 - Cate: Yay!
16:25, 30 Dec 2013 - Teegan: Awww, Marth, you're such a poet! I'm easy either way x
16:29, 30 Dec 2013 - Bunn: <Media omitted>
16:29, 30 Dec 2013 - Bunn: Our table is NOT covered in crap
16:30, 30 Dec 2013 - Bunn: (I cleaned. I took offence to that one)
16:32, 30 Dec 2013 - Slam: (Bunn cleaned. He took offence to that one)
16:34, 30 Dec 2013 - Bunn: We could substitute new years day walk by the sea with something in london together?
16:55, 30 Dec 2013 - Teegan: Do you guys really not fancy it?
16:59, 30 Dec 2013 - Slam: I'm getting way more into the idea of c-town by the minute!
17:00, 30 Dec 2013 - Slam: We've got twice the people as last year, and we'll have the place all nice for you ladies
17:01, 30 Dec 2013 - Dave Mendez: Fancy a hand getting it ready tonight? Perhaps in testing the sofa out.
17:03, 30 Dec 2013 - Slam: Hehe in my experience that rarely ends in the place getting tidier!
17:04, 30 Dec 2013 - Dave Mendez: You can trust me...
17:04, 30 Dec 2013 - Slam: Sofa's free and waiting for you if you're around though
17:05, 30 Dec 2013 - Dave Mendez: Woot. There's a plan to meet Chris Alford tonight if anyone's up for that. X
17:06, 30 Dec 2013 - Bunn: Yeah i am. But whats the plan? All iv heard is flimsyness
17:09, 30 Dec 2013 - Dave Mendez: Sounds like a rerun of the last brick lane night. Any better suggestions?
17:11, 30 Dec 2013 - Slam: Partying? Blurgh! I intend to drink some fine scotch and play some games, sleep well and get cracking for tomorrow
17:15, 30 Dec 2013 - Teegan: Better suggestions please- on the facebook page If possible,  to keep Chris in the loop
17:31, 30 Dec 2013 - Bunn: Cool
17:48, 30 Dec 2013 - Dave Mendez: Sounds like the plan is to meet at the big chill in kings cross.
17:49, 30 Dec 2013 - Cate: Can I come? What's the details? X
17:50, 30 Dec 2013 - Bunn: 7 o clock kings cross
17:51, 30 Dec 2013 - Cate: Haven't eaten yet, soonest I'd get to kings cross is about 830-9. Still worth it?
17:52, 30 Dec 2013 - Teegan: Where are you Cate? I haven't eaten yet either, so we could grab something around there.

12:34, 31 Dec 2013 - Bunn: Yeah dont go OTT
12:34, 31 Dec 2013 - Shaggy Crazy Horse: No, spend what you will

14:41, 31 Dec 2013 - Owen James: I'm not coming sorry. I am not well, stupid viruses.
14:44, 31 Dec 2013 - Eliza Botts: Afraid it's not looking good, O is very poorly. I think we're going to stay home, watch a film and go to bed at 12.01 like the boring married couple we are. :( Have an awesome time though, and we will make a New Years resolution to be a little less feeble.
14:44, 31 Dec 2013 - Shaggy Crazy Horse: He's ill, you're not, come over
14:45, 31 Dec 2013 - Eliza Botts: Tempted... but I'd feel a bit mean leaving him alone and sick on New Years.

15:45, 31 Dec 2013 - Owen James: I'll sleeze on my wife as much as I damn well please.
15:46, 31 Dec 2013 - Owen James: Hey sweet knees (eliza). I better ring heaven, coz an angel just grabbed its coat.
15:47, 31 Dec 2013 - Shaggy Crazy Horse: Fever running high?

12:36, 2 Jan - Marth: Is it plugged in by the left of the tv? I saw a samsung charger camouflaged  there (it had an iPhone cable plugged into it). Reckon the samsung cable isn't far away either...
12:37, 2 Jan - Slam: No idea, there's one by my bed if you need some juice just now though x

12:51, 3 Jan - Bunn: But now its starting to turn worse
13:03, 3 Jan - Shaggy Crazy Horse: Thunder and lightning here now

13:16, 3 Jan - Bunn: Dry january off to a good start eh?
13:16, 3 Jan - Teegan: ... the storm is over
13:17, 3 Jan - Teegan: Dry January starts on the 5th. .. It's gonna be so wholesome
13:17, 3 Jan - Teegan: Or Phil and I might take up crack...
13:17, 3 Jan - ‚Ä™+44 7807 744465‚Ä¨: Are you doing dry jan too Tegan?!!
13:29, 3 Jan - Teegan: Are you surprised because of my obvious alcoholism? Yeah, Dave and I thought we'd give it a bash. The worst we can do is fail and end up in a downward spiral of alcohol dependency.  Which sounds like some fun!
13:31, 3 Jan - ‚Ä™+44 7807 744465‚Ä¨: Yay! Me and shags also trying
13:31, 3 Jan - ‚Ä™+44 7807 744465‚Ä¨: We can hang out at weekends and urm, ummmmmmm...
13:31, 3 Jan - ‚Ä™+44 7807 744465‚Ä¨: What do people do at weekends when they're not drinking/hungover?
13:32, 3 Jan - Bunn: Go for a jog??
13:55, 3 Jan - Shaggy Crazy Horse: Ugh
13:57, 3 Jan - Teegan: Let's get into exotic juices.  Or world teas.
13:57, 3 Jan - Teegan: Or we can revert to teenagedom and hang out in arcades.
13:57, 3 Jan - Shaggy Crazy Horse: I read that as "tegandom"
14:28, 3 Jan - p tschismarov: Have any of you considered devoting your weekends to the worship of Jesus Christ our lord and saviour?
14:25, 3 Jan - ‚Ä™+44 7807 744465‚Ä¨: Has anyone else seen that vice documentary about people (Americans) who claim to get high on the glory of god?

14:27, 3 Jan - Marth: Epic
14:29, 3 Jan - Bunn: Behold the glory
15:31, 3 Jan - Teegan: Phil, if you dress like that all the way through January, I think we might just make it
17:15, 3 Jan - Teegan: Anyone up for a drink after work? I want to celebrates my imminent immunity to yellow fever
17:21, 3 Jan - Slam: I'm back on the scotch and cranking, need a kind of early night tonight I think, the white fascists got kind of out of hand yesterday!

19:05, 6 Jan - Dave Mendez: Do they have a veggie burger?
19:18, 6 Jan - Slam: I think they have one made out of vegetarians, any good?
19:24, 6 Jan - Teegan: Mmmmmmm.... grilled cheese sandwich...
19:26, 6 Jan - Slam: I have done some research, they have a veggie option where you get the bun and all the veg you can fit in it, like grilled shrooms and onions, which are done on a separate veg grill
21:27, 6 Jan - Vanessa "Beast" Matthews: Oh yum the veggie option sounds really good. I might have to have it after my meat
09:53, 7 Jan - Slam: Anyone for a cine-trip tomorrow? I'd like to see the new ben stiller thing
09:53, 7 Jan - Shaggy Crazy Horse: Maybe, haven't been to a picture theatre in quite a while
09:56, 7 Jan - Marth: Meh. I've got a dinner with a friend visiting tomorrow, so will have to give it a miss this time. I really fancy seeing american hustle - next week?
10:00, 7 Jan - Vanessa "Beast" Matthews: No can do for me either this week
10:25, 7 Jan - Bunn: Apparently american hustle is really bad
10:26, 7 Jan - Shaggy Crazy Horse: Apparently Jennifer Lawrence looks boday in American hustle
10:26, 7 Jan - Marth: Damn, until now I had only heard good things.
10:26, 7 Jan - Marth: Bunn, why you gotta rain on ma parade? Grr
10:27, 7 Jan - Shaggy Crazy Horse: Again
10:27, 7 Jan - Marth: Indeed, again.
10:27, 7 Jan - Bunn: Im trying to save you! Iv only heard bad things. Not one good review
10:29, 7 Jan - Bunn: Probably wrong tho...
10:34, 7 Jan - Bunn: But mostly its cos i like to ruin things
11:03, 7 Jan - Owen James: Rotten tomatoes has American hustle at 95%. So it can't be all bad. Me and liza were thinking of seeing it.
11:05, 7 Jan - Shaggy Crazy Horse: I don't rate rotten tomatoes
11:06, 7 Jan - Owen James: Really why? It seems pretty accurate to me. And has a simple easy to understand algorithm.
11:21, 7 Jan - Eliza Botts: I'm up for seeing it Marth, despite all this rain.
11:22, 7 Jan - Eliza Botts: Unless there's actual rain... in which case I'll probably stay in...
11:23, 7 Jan - Marth: Yay! Unfortunately I can't tomorrow though, was thinking maybe pnext week orange wed?
11:24, 7 Jan - Eliza Botts: Next week is good.
11:47, 7 Jan - Shaggy Crazy Horse: Rotten tomatoes seems to consistently disagree with me, or at least it used to and now I never use it. Or any ratings site, word of mouth is best for this sort of thing, bar only to own impressions
12:51, 7 Jan - p tschismarov: Name one thing that does not consistently disagree with you.
12:49, 7 Jan - Bongo: Beer
12:51, 7 Jan - Shaggy Crazy Horse: Word
12:56, 7 Jan - ‚Ä™+44 7807 744465‚Ä¨: <Media omitted>
13:12, 7 Jan - Bunn: <Media omitted>
13:32, 7 Jan - p tschismarov: Brontosaurus mance.
14:07, 7 Jan - Owen James: Perhaps you just have terrible taste in films shaggy. Also if it consistently disagrees with you then it is an excellent system, you just need to do the opposite of what it says.
14:54, 7 Jan - Shaggy Crazy Horse: It's not excellent, it's terrible, just like bbc weather. If I have to change my mindset just so that one system works as well as others, it's a failure as a product
15:08, 7 Jan - Owen James: Can you give me examples of where it is wrong?
15:09, 7 Jan - Shaggy Crazy Horse: Like I said I haven't used it since its conception
15:09, 7 Jan - Owen James: So you have no idea if it is good or bad then?
15:09, 7 Jan - Bunn: <Media omitted>
15:10, 7 Jan - Owen James: I generally find it pretty excellent
15:10, 7 Jan - Bunn: <Media omitted>
15:10, 7 Jan - Shaggy Crazy Horse: I know it was bad
15:11, 7 Jan - Shaggy Crazy Horse: And everyone knows rotten tomatoes don't get any better
15:12, 7 Jan - Owen James: I think you may be confusing the website with the fruit.
15:56, 7 Jan - Slam: Science time! Give us 3 films you really like, and 3 you really don't.  Newer films would be better, and no cheating!
16:04, 7 Jan - Shaggy Crazy Horse: I had a browse already: rush was a great film, 89 is perhaps overrated but I'll let it slide. Snatch is 73 which I think is too low, it's certainly a million times better than rush, but perhaps it's an old film. Pitch black, that came out same time as snatch, is 57 and a failure? Well that's bullshit, it's an excellent film. I know exactly the soppy heart wrenching and gut warming films they would rate highly and it's not at all aligned to my tastes
16:15, 7 Jan - Bunn: Eurgh. Shaddap already. This is not bants
16:15, 7 Jan - Slam: That's bad testing! It means nothing if you do it blind, you're basically saying you found 3 films you kind of agree with
16:16, 7 Jan - Bunn: No1 cares about your moanig shaggy
16:16, 7 Jan - Bunn: Moaning*
16:18, 7 Jan - Owen James: Also 57% is very close to fresh. The only problem I have with rotten tomatoes is the binary nature of fresh/rotten.  If you just go by percentage instead it is more accurate.
16:18, 7 Jan - Slam: Pitch black was a solid 57, enjoyable but not particularly great
16:18, 7 Jan - Shaggy Crazy Horse: No one cares about *your* moaning bunn

16:21, 7 Jan - Bunn: The pub is for arguing
16:22, 7 Jan - Shaggy Crazy Horse: No because that would assume I have knowledge of what is and isn't, and I don't. I picked a film I watched recently, a film I know is excellent and a film I know I would enjoy
16:22, 7 Jan - Bunn: #dryjanuarysucks
16:22, 7 Jan - Dave Mendez: Agreed
16:23, 7 Jan - Bunn: Thanks dave
16:23, 7 Jan - Shaggy Crazy Horse: Based on rt I don't know if I wouldn't enjoy a film or some arsehole wouldn't enjoy a film. Moreover I don't know if a film is good so that I would enjoy it or good so it gets loads of nominations and I dot give a shit about

15:33, 8 Jan - Mike: What the hell was that ass thing all about?

09:27, 9 Jan - Vanessa "Beast" Matthews: <Media omitted>
09:32, 9 Jan - p tschismarov: Not bad. Keep at it and one day you'll be writing beautiful stories about rainbow unicorn princesses.
09:30, 9 Jan - Owen James: To be fair. The question is ambiguous and the pupil has given a correct answer given the ambiguity.
09:39, 9 Jan - Bunn: How much detention would you give them owen?
09:59, 9 Jan - Owen James: Zero. Because that answer is awesome!

16:13, 9 Jan - Slam: Both. Elevenses is for everyday
16:15, 9 Jan - Vanessa "Beast" Matthews: I was answering Hannah's question

16:19, 9 Jan - Eliza Botts: Owen's right. This is the place for dumb jokes and arguments about personal taste. Not sorting things out.

13:50, 10 Jan - Shaggy Crazy Horse: Such is the horde
13:53, 10 Jan - Mike: Just looked it up - one of the collective nouns for cats is 'pounce'

18:37, 10 Jan - Teegan: So it's only fitting
18:38, 10 Jan - Dave Mendez: I guess the legroom won't make much of an impression on you so it's only right to enjoy the drinks. X
18:39, 10 Jan - Teegan: It's a blip. Not a slide down an icy January slope. Into a pit of beer.
18:40, 10 Jan - Dave Mendez: Drool.
18:51, 10 Jan - Shaggy Crazy Horse: I thought you appreciated the plant pots, Tegan. You're just drunk!
18:51, 10 Jan - Teegan: Emphatically both
18:52, 10 Jan - Dave Mendez: Do you get better food?
18:52, 10 Jan - Teegan: (It was only a small glass of champagne)

23:33, 13 Jan - Slam: 4 should mean everyone can use whenever

14:45, 14 Jan - p tschismarov: Yo Dave you should take your boat across this thing
14:45, 14 Jan - p tschismarov: <Media omitted>
14:44, 14 Jan - Dave Mendez: Ah, the unpronounceable aqueduct in Wales! I'd love to, its a proper dream. Might have to take a few weeks off work for that. Mmmm

18:22, 14 Jan - Shaggy Crazy Horse: Google lucky chip hoxton
18:26, 14 Jan - Vanessa "Beast" Matthews: I won't make it before 7:30
18:27, 14 Jan - Shaggy Crazy Horse: Going to pop into tk maxx, need more pjs
18:32, 14 Jan - Slam: That's not a bad shout, is there one around here?
18:35, 14 Jan - ‚Ä™+44 7807 744465‚Ä¨: Guys would you rather have teeth for pubes or pubes for teeth?
18:36, 14 Jan - Teegan: Teeth for pubes.  Otherwise you'd have to develop a whale-like method of eating which would be awkward at dinner parties.
18:36, 14 Jan - Dave Mendez: Teeth for pubes
18:36, 14 Jan - Dave Mendez: For reasons stated
18:36, 14 Jan - Teegan: Good question Hannah. Touching on deep and important issues.
18:37, 14 Jan - Shaggy Crazy Horse: Bank
18:37, 14 Jan - Shaggy Crazy Horse: Or rather monument
18:38, 14 Jan - Shaggy Crazy Horse: What kind of teeth? Molars would be ok
18:39, 14 Jan - Slam: Ah yeah
18:40, 14 Jan - Teegan: Are they set in, so that pube maintenance would literally be pulling teeth? I sort of imagined then jangling about
18:40, 14 Jan - Shaggy Crazy Horse: Terrible selection, it's like they don't care about peoples home comfort
18:40, 14 Jan - Teegan: That tk maxx sucks. It's all 'business'
18:40, 14 Jan - Shaggy Crazy Horse: Would you need to brush them regularly?
18:41, 14 Jan - Teegan: Ha
18:43, 14 Jan - ‚Ä™+44 7807 744465‚Ä¨: I think teeth for pubes as only few people would know your secret
18:44, 14 Jan - ‚Ä™+44 7807 744465‚Ä¨: Unless of course you made whipping them out a great party trick
18:44, 14 Jan - Shaggy Crazy Horse: Wouldn't everyone have that?
18:44, 14 Jan - Shaggy Crazy Horse: I thought it was like an evolutionary question
18:45, 14 Jan - Bunn: Just you
18:45, 14 Jan - Bunn: Sex would be weird if everyone had it
18:45, 14 Jan - Bunn: Probably quite painful too
18:45, 14 Jan - Teegan: Nah,  it makes more sense if it's everyone
18:46, 14 Jan - Bunn: A lot of danger of getting chomped
18:46, 14 Jan - Teegan: Otherwise theres no rationale for it happening at all
18:46, 14 Jan - Shaggy Crazy Horse: Living on the edge, baby
18:46, 14 Jan - Bunn: Its a 'would YOU rather' question though
18:47, 14 Jan - Teegan: You'd probably develop some kind of defense
18:47, 14 Jan - Shaggy Crazy Horse: That's very egocentric
18:47, 14 Jan - Teegan: Like an armadillo
18:47, 14 Jan - Teegan: Is also negative banter
18:47, 14 Jan - Bunn: I guess if everyone got asked the question and made a choice
18:47, 14 Jan - Bunn: Then if they disnt have a mouth full of pubes
18:48, 14 Jan - Bunn: It would be safe to assume they went for the teeth for pubes option
18:48, 14 Jan - Bunn: And you could have weird teeth crunching sex
18:49, 14 Jan - Teegan: Beautiful
18:49, 14 Jan - Shaggy Crazy Horse: Not from behind
18:49, 14 Jan - Bunn: That might be the only option in this weird fantasy world
18:50, 14 Jan - Shaggy Crazy Horse: Would you have pubic milk teeth?
18:51, 14 Jan - Bunn: Gross. Just picturing someone with pubes for teeth is making me ill
18:51, 14 Jan - Teegan: Agreed
18:51, 14 Jan - Shaggy Crazy Horse: I meant the other way around
18:52, 14 Jan - Teegan: Always having hair in your mouth might be one of the worst feeling things
18:52, 14 Jan - Shaggy Crazy Horse: You probably get used to it. You could style it all you want with saliva
18:52, 14 Jan - Teegan: Blerk
19:01, 14 Jan - Mike: 53 new messages
19:01, 14 Jan - Mike: Wtf guys

19:03, 14 Jan - ‚Ä™+44 7807 744465‚Ä¨: You've really helped me here
19:09, 14 Jan - Slam: I've spent too long thinking about this
19:10, 14 Jan - Slam: But I'm down for pubes for teeth
19:10, 14 Jan - Slam: You could trim them right down, and I think having a Johnson ringed with teeth is like saying goodbye to sex
19:12, 14 Jan - Mike: I refuse to read the rest of this conversation
19:13, 14 Jan - Mike: Wouldn't teeth for pubes look like awesome ivory underwear
19:13, 14 Jan - Mike: Id go that
19:24, 14 Jan - Teegan: That's how I was picturing it, Mike
19:24, 14 Jan - Teegan: Kinda tribal

23:30, 20 Jan - Mike: Will there still be a burger group?
23:42, 20 Jan - Slam: I'll revel in the human exploitation with you Mike
23:42, 20 Jan - Slam: It's either that or salsa dancing. I'll take human suffering every time
23:50, 20 Jan - p tschismarov: Wows has the fat guy from the mclovin film. T'should be good.
12:11, 21 Jan - Teegan: Looking for a likely burger on the wharf. .. byron gets all the reviews
12:11, 21 Jan - Teegan: But is Super expensive
12:12, 21 Jan - Shaggy Crazy Horse: Same price as all others
12:13, 21 Jan - Teegan: Also dave had some ulterior motive for not going
12:13, 21 Jan - Teegan: Other option is GBK, which is not at all original
12:13, 21 Jan - Teegan: But is full of food
12:14, 21 Jan - Shaggy Crazy Horse: Gbk is quite good, lots I burger options
12:18, 21 Jan - Teegan: Plenty of time for votes and debate throughout the afternoon
12:59, 21 Jan - Owen James: Me and eliza are seeing wolf tonight.
13:00, 21 Jan - Dave Mendez: We're joining you. Looking to see if we can burger on the wharf beforehand
13:03, 21 Jan - Owen James: Me and eliza are eating at home. We shall come for drinks after you burgharrrgh though
13:07, 21 Jan - Dave Mendez: Aight. Any votes on burger venue tonight?
13:26, 21 Jan - Slam: I recommend Byron, it's slightly more expensive but a thousand times more deliciou
13:26, 21 Jan - Slam: What time's the film?
13:31, 21 Jan - Eliza Botts: 7.30 or 8.15 - would prefer the earlier time as the film is almost 3 hours long...
13:40, 21 Jan - Marth: Yikes. Yes please, earlier rather than later for me too. Is there another venue where we can see it even earlier? Xx
14:38, 21 Jan - Teegan: Earlier showing is best- can people make 6.30 for dinner? Advantage of the wharf is the cheap tuesday which I am keen to take advantage of
14:42, 21 Jan - Slam: O2 is cineworld as well, if that helps
14:43, 21 Jan - Owen James: üêäRarrrgh!!! Stomp!!! Smash!!!üêä
14:45, 21 Jan - Eliza Botts: There is a showing at 6.40 at canary wharf, but not sure that leaves time for eating? I need to eat something before 3 hour film...
14:46, 21 Jan - Owen James: ÓÄùwhoooshÓÄù
14:53, 21 Jan - Eliza Botts: Shun Owen
14:54, 21 Jan - Eliza Botts: Oop, that was supposed to be 'shhh Owen'. But that will do just as well.
15:38, 21 Jan - Owen James: üê©woof woofüê©
15:50, 21 Jan - Teegan: I agree. With Lize. Hard to agree with Owen here. That is to say, not eating before a 3 hour movie will make me cross. Meet at 6? I'm going to vote GBK because the veggie selection at byron looks half arsed, but I could be persuaded by the pain of others for Scottish meat.  If it were a thing.
15:52, 21 Jan - Mike: I partly agree with Owen. I think his crocodile was way off though
16:03, 21 Jan - Dave Mendez: I agree with everybody! Merry Christmas! Xx
16:38, 21 Jan - Teegan: Useful stuff, guys.
16:39, 21 Jan - Dave Mendez: Gbk please. Byron looks weak for the veg veg

22:24, 21 Jan - Bunn: How was the film guys?
23:28, 21 Jan - Mike: Did it finish yet?
00:23, 22 Jan - Dave Mendez: It finished. It was pretty good, didn't feel like three hours. There are some great scenes and it's very entertaining but a bit shallow. Perhaps that's the point.
00:39, 22 Jan - Teegan: I really liked it. I laughed heartily as di Caprio got fucked up and commited fraud. Thumbs up.

08:33, 23 Jan - Mike: That film was amazing, but so damn tough
08:55, 23 Jan - Slam: I thought it was pretty optimistic actually
08:57, 23 Jan - Slam: It's basically the sorry of a man getting away from all his rich superficial friends, and starting a life of outdoor living, where he gets to travel and lot and meet a wide variety of people
08:58, 23 Jan - Owen James: You should be one of those voltswagen "see film differently" people sam.
09:00, 23 Jan - Mike: Haha. It also makes it easier if you watch it as the prequel to Django Unchained
10:03, 23 Jan - p tschismarov: The trailer made it look like a goofy, happy film.

17:44, 23 Jan - Teegan: Any fun planned this evening?
18:03, 23 Jan - Slam: Woooo climbing! actually I'm probably not making it, l looks like frustrating work, kebab and early night tonight
18:06, 23 Jan - Teegan: How would it be if I finished my frustrating work, came over and cooked something even better than a kebab, and then stared at your tv?
18:07, 23 Jan - Teegan: Obviously the plan would still work if you really wanted a kebab
18:16, 23 Jan - Shaggy Crazy Horse: Sounds great tegs, come on round
18:23, 23 Jan - Slam: I might get a kebab, and put it in whatever you cook

15:03, 25 Jan - Bongo: Well I'm coming round to pick up my squash racket before it starts so I'll throw  in some chicken and motivation juice (beer).
15:03, 25 Jan - Shaggy Crazy Horse: Have you caved in as well?

22:06, 27 Jan - Eliza Botts: Have you watched the first episode of Archer where Archer is a velociraptor? It's pretty funny.
22:17, 27 Jan - Mike: I watched that episode randomly with no context. Was so confused
22:22, 27 Jan - Owen James: It makes the show even better.
00:47, 28 Jan - Slam: Didn't get to see them, I thought it was a good idea to get tickets on the door. It wasn't!
12:58, 28 Jan - Slam: Happy burger day everyone! Honest burger tonight, it's on Dean street just by Soho square
12:58, 28 Jan - Slam: I'll try and get there for 7 to get a table, it gets busy but there's a bunch of other places nearby if it's too bad

17:57, 28 Jan - Shaggy Crazy Horse: Need the president to go as well, although a whole cabinet is already good
18:02, 28 Jan - Teegan: It's a start I guess.  The beeb say no barricades will move until the president steps down. Excellent protesting.
18:03, 28 Jan - Shaggy Crazy Horse: No half measures. They should get relentless so sponsor the people

16:01, 29 Jan - Teegan: Either good for me. If we go to the late one we can eat first
16:01, 29 Jan - Teegan: Mmmm... eat
16:01, 29 Jan - Teegan: Do we have a fourth person?
17:15, 29 Jan - Mike: Food in C wharf? Will be around for about 7.30

15:04, 30 Jan - Shaggy Crazy Horse: Where I came from might not be a country soon. Again
15:45, 30 Jan - Owen James: Do you have dual citizenship or are you just British? If the former what would happen?
16:05, 30 Jan - Shaggy Crazy Horse: Just British
16:06, 30 Jan - Shaggy Crazy Horse: If the former it would have depended on the new country dual citizenship laws as well as process of re-establishing citizenship in a newly formed country given the citizenship in the old one
16:24, 30 Jan - Teegan: Lots of people, especially rural,  become citizens of nowhere that way.  Sad.
17:02, 30 Jan - Bunn: Sounds pretty awesome being a citizen of nowhere
17:03, 30 Jan - Bunn: Destined to wander the earths surface looking for justice
17:03, 30 Jan - Bunn: And....
17:03, 30 Jan - Bunn: Revenge
17:31, 30 Jan - Teegan: Yeeeaahh
17:37, 30 Jan - Bunn: *epic 80s guitar solo*
18:54, 30 Jan - Teegan: Except you'd mainly be playing epic guitar solos in border control cells
18:55, 30 Jan - Teegan: They'd still be epic, obviously
09:27, 31 Jan - Shaggy Crazy Horse: Uff tea - does everyone have threads to wear for this?

19:15, 31 Jan - Bongo: Centre of Greenwich, we're going to do crazy stuff, if you catch my drift.
19:19, 31 Jan - Bongo: You're bent over at work until 2am?!
19:20, 31 Jan - Bongo: Surely not
19:22, 31 Jan - Slam: Ok, maybe 8, it's still an infringement of my liberty though
19:22, 31 Jan - Slam: I'm being oppressed!
19:23, 31 Jan - Bunn: People from canning town complaining that grenwich is far.
19:25, 31 Jan - Mike: I'm still trying to figure out what the crazy stuff is
19:28, 31 Jan - Shaggy Crazy Horse: Buttsex
19:32, 31 Jan - p tschismarov: Mad bingo yo
19:36, 31 Jan - Bongo: Mad bingo with hookers and nose candy

14:18, 1 Feb - Marth: Picking up my new bike
14:20, 1 Feb - Marth: ÓÑ∂

14:29, 1 Feb - Bongo: That sounds fun, I'm tempted to buy one just to do that.
14:31, 1 Feb - Slam: Sounds like a sweet ride, you got a basket and done rainbow tassles for that bad boy?

19:41, 3 Feb - ‚Ä™+44 7807 744465‚Ä¨: I have 2 beautiful French girls stayin with me (my Parisienne housemates from when I lived there)
19:42, 3 Feb - ‚Ä™+44 7807 744465‚Ä¨: Is it cool if I bring them?
19:42, 3 Feb - Mike: Um duh

20:05, 3 Feb - Shaggy Crazy Horse: Both days
20:33, 3 Feb - Owen James: Do the burgers match this one. Everything is made from scratch... except the colslaw.
20:33, 3 Feb - Owen James: <Media omitted>
21:32, 3 Feb - Teegan: I can't believe you couldn't be bothered to make your own coleslaw!

18:20, 4 Feb - Slam: Meal and a show for me! What's the deal with the American Bunn?
18:26, 4 Feb - Bunn: I think he'll be round tonight
18:28, 4 Feb - Vanessa "Beast" Matthews: I just ordered my burger
18:29, 4 Feb - Slam: Send us a sepia picture when it gets there please, I HAVE TO KNOW what it looks like!
18:30, 4 Feb - Vanessa "Beast" Matthews: <Media omitted>
18:30, 4 Feb - Vanessa "Beast" Matthews: It's really dark in here
18:31, 4 Feb - Dave Mendez: Is it cool for Tegs and I to stay over tonight as the tube is gonna make travel to Uxbridge crazy.
18:32, 4 Feb - Slam: Yarrr! You'll have to wrestle an American for the best bed though. Loser gets Phil's room
18:32, 4 Feb - Slam: That burger looks like a Ron Swanson special
18:37, 4 Feb - Vanessa "Beast" Matthews: It's a pretty good burger
18:38, 4 Feb - Slam: Out of ten?
18:39, 4 Feb - Shaggy Crazy Horse: That burger looks super tiny
18:39, 4 Feb - Vanessa "Beast" Matthews: 7.5
18:39, 4 Feb - Vanessa "Beast" Matthews: It has a lot of meat
18:41, 4 Feb - Slam: That's an ok burger, right there. Is it as small as it looks, or are they American style ten gallon coffee cups?
18:41, 4 Feb - Vanessa "Beast" Matthews: Nah it's decent size
18:41, 4 Feb - Vanessa "Beast" Matthews: The plate is huge
20:16, 4 Feb - Mike: What's the craic D&T?
08:52, 5 Feb - Teegan: Hey guys, can someone help me out with the wifi settings in c town- I have the IP address but not the rest. Don't make me go to the office!
09:07, 5 Feb - Mike: <Media omitted>
09:09, 5 Feb - Teegan: Hero! Thanks x
11:11, 5 Feb - Bunn: Is this to stop the wifi being so terrible?
11:12, 5 Feb - Bunn: I need this
11:16, 5 Feb - Shaggy Crazy Horse: I'm bringing a router from work to deal with this
14:34, 5 Feb - Teegan: You guys have a little mouse. He is very sweet, but should probably live somewhere else.
14:35, 5 Feb - Teegan: Or as Owen would say, ÓÅì.
15:49, 5 Feb - Shaggy Crazy Horse: Her name M-M-M-Monster.
16:11, 5 Feb - Bongo: Maybe she'll have epic battles with the rat. We should arm her and throw a training montage.
16:13, 5 Feb - Bongo: And film the results
16:13, 5 Feb - Bongo: Make lots of money
16:13, 5 Feb - Bongo: And move to brazil
16:18, 5 Feb - Bunn: Home made humane mouse trap anyone?
16:18, 5 Feb - Bunn: Little engineering project
16:27, 5 Feb - Shaggy Crazy Horse: We have a glue trap. I suggested we also put spikes and poison on it.
16:37, 5 Feb - Dave Mendez: Let's buy Mousetrap and use that
17:31, 5 Feb - Teegan: I vote for Bongo's idea. Then Bunn and Dave's
17:36, 5 Feb - Marth: Not shag's "pimp my trap"? We could have had a contest. I'm thinking a mini replica of the canning town drive-through macDs...
17:36, 5 Feb - Marth: Or get a cat!!!!
17:37, 5 Feb - Marth: (So excited I thought of that)
17:37, 5 Feb - Shaggy Crazy Horse: Would you rather: use a glue trap and butcher said mouse with a cleaver or capture her with a humane mouse trap and throw outside to die in the freezing cold hinted by canning town ghetto predators?
17:38, 5 Feb - Shaggy Crazy Horse: I'm allergic to cats, so fuck you
17:39, 5 Feb - Bunn: Yeah we cant get a cat cos of Shaggy's dumb allergies
17:41, 5 Feb - Teegan: Maybe we should keep it,  and put a waistcoat on it,  and pet it and pet it and pet it?
17:43, 5 Feb - Marth: Replace shaggy with a cat?
17:43, 5 Feb - Marth: ... joke?
17:43, 5 Feb - Shaggy Crazy Horse: Hmmm....I could use a better place to live...
17:45, 5 Feb - Slam: How about a pet that eats mice, but doesn't trigger allergies?
17:46, 5 Feb - Slam: There's that python going in Bristol, that would be cool
17:46, 5 Feb - Bongo: Didn't we use the glue trap the. Throw it in the snow last time?
17:46, 5 Feb - Shaggy Crazy Horse: Perfect! I propose we name it Cate
17:46, 5 Feb - Bongo: I don't think it gets much more inhumane than that
17:47, 5 Feb - Shaggy Crazy Horse: Not true. Freezing is one if the better ways to die
17:48, 5 Feb - Slam: We all eat animals, I don't think we can consistently cry over the slightly uncomfortable death of vermin
20:23, 5 Feb - Wills joined
17:49, 5 Feb - Slam: Also, Pete got one with a hammer once, I've always been a bit jealous of that
18:05, 5 Feb - Teegan: That was a terrible sorry.  If mice had a bible, that mouse would almost certainly be jesus.
18:06, 5 Feb - Shaggy Crazy Horse: And they would learn not to live in out houses and eat our food. We all live dairy tales. Except the bible. It's terrible
18:11, 5 Feb - Teegan: Dave doesn't live dairy tales.
18:11, 5 Feb - Shaggy Crazy Horse: Haha so much misspelling
18:16, 5 Feb - Bunn: Wagwan tonight?
18:18, 5 Feb - Slam: Drink ? Salsa if I can be bothered. It's not looking good. We could do speakers maybe?
18:21, 5 Feb - Bunn: That'd be nice to get done. I'll txt xav
18:21, 5 Feb - Bunn: Wait. Tube strike. We'll do it next week
18:22, 5 Feb - Slam: Hah, for sure!
18:54, 5 Feb - Teegan: Does this mean there is no plan?
19:22, 5 Feb - Shaggy Crazy Horse: I wouldn't rely on those guys to have a plan
20:11, 5 Feb - Slam: We've got a lot of plans, that's the easy part!

19:08, 8 Feb - Shaggy Crazy Horse: Aptly named, a great drink for dry ginuary
19:15, 8 Feb - Shaggy Crazy Horse: Don't think I'm going to make it out of the house today, only just stopped the hangover. Plus it's raining, so cycling's out of the question

19:25, 8 Feb - Shaggy Crazy Horse: Mmmmmmmmmm Dallas chicken
17:13, 9 Feb - Vanessa "Beast" Matthews: It's -22 but feels like -33. It's so cold that there are ice crystals in the air that it looks like permanent glitter
18:03, 9 Feb - Teegan: I can't even begin to fathom what that means! But it sounds beautiful.
18:05, 9 Feb - Shaggy Crazy Horse: Sounds like acid
20:50, 9 Feb - p tschismarov: <Media omitted>
20:52, 9 Feb - p tschismarov: <Media omitted>
20:53, 9 Feb - p tschismarov: Testing

20:51, 9 Feb - Shaggy Crazy Horse: Wow Vienna looks great this time of year
21:01, 9 Feb - Slam: Jesus see a doctor dude, that stuff looks like an explosion in a mountain dew factory
21:15, 9 Feb - p tschismarov: I had to use my superlative paint skills for this. Not for lack of trying with more natural means though. I heroically drank huge amounts of wine and beer. All for the arts and for your birthday you ungrateful swine.
21:15, 9 Feb - Slam: I greatly appreciate every millilitre of effort you've put in brother, i'll quaff my next tea in your honour!
21:16, 9 Feb - Bunn: Phil i think you wouldv appreciated our heroic drinking games last night
21:34, 9 Feb - p tschismarov: From what i'm reading i'm surprised anybody is still alive.
23:53, 9 Feb - Owen James: What does "hb8" mean phil?
23:54, 9 Feb - Mike: That's clearly a delta
06:12, 10 Feb - p tschismarov: You try writing in natural paint in snow that's up past your knees with shrunken equipment and then editing the results using sophisticated photo manipulation software (sometimes pixel by pixel).
13:13, 10 Feb - Slam: Now that I'm over the student style hangover that was yesterday, mainly spent curled around the toilet wishing for the sweet release of death, thanks to all of you for making Friday an almost perfect night! My only regret is that I never got down to see the stabby rap room, I blame whoever said they were playing Destinies Child at about 11!
13:13, 10 Feb - Mike: Seen it
13:14, 10 Feb - Slam: Also special thanks to Bongo for saving everyone a massive headache and putting the meal on his card, that must've been huge so please make sure people pay him back!
20:11, 10 Feb - Bongo: Damn I just replied on the other channel - most people paid and some people over paid so whatevs everyone who's left can just buy me a pint
20:12, 10 Feb - Bongo: That was hella fun seeing everyone as well, we should do mass meals more often
20:18, 10 Feb - ‚Ä™+44 7807 744465‚Ä¨: My friend just discovered a new Nordic themed bar which is apparently great fun, we should all goooo
20:34, 10 Feb - Slam: Done! When?
20:55, 10 Feb - Bongo: Nordic = shouting loads and pounding on tables yes?
20:55, 10 Feb - Bongo: Then I'm in as well.
22:37, 10 Feb - Owen James: I don't want to alarm you all but I have the makings ofa game better than the demon game.
22:38, 10 Feb - Slam: Give us titillating hints!
15:06, 11 Feb - Teegan: Very excited about this,  owen
15:07, 11 Feb - Teegan: Guys, I heard some terrible hippies left clothes,  hats and ukeleles all over your house- can we come over to tidy up after them please?
15:07, 11 Feb - Slam: It's ok, we burnt it all, back to the normal c-town squalor now
15:09, 11 Feb - Slam: You'd be very welcome to come dance in the ashes though, Mike's probably the best bet for tonight x
15:17, 11 Feb - Eliza Botts: Some titillating hints...spies... moles... scavenger hunt... Ooooh!
17:23, 11 Feb - Teegan: I like the ooooh bit best
17:24, 11 Feb - Teegan: How's about it Mike? What plans?
17:27, 11 Feb - Mike: Heading home soon, will be back about 7ish?
17:31, 11 Feb - Teegan: Fun. I fancy a film and a beer. Compliance?
17:55, 11 Feb - Mike: I'll allow it
17:56, 11 Feb - Mike: We have HIV cowboy film
17:58, 11 Feb - Slam: I love your film choices. There's one just come out about a going French girl who falls through different levels of degradation and sexual experimentation
17:58, 11 Feb - Slam: It sounds like the blackest of black comedies, it made me think of you
18:01, 11 Feb - Slam: Ooh also there's a new cirque de soleil thing I want to go to if anyone's up for it
18:02, 11 Feb - Slam: And Robocop!
18:05, 11 Feb - Shaggy Crazy Horse: I don't think quidam is new, although their names all sound weirdly samey
20:54, 11 Feb - Bongo: Sam that film you described just sounds like porn.
21:02, 11 Feb - Mike: Nymphomaniac?
21:03, 11 Feb - Mike: Hear you see shia le buif shagging for real
21:03, 11 Feb - Mike: Shabby la bleef whatever his name is
21:23, 11 Feb - Slam: Yeah that one! Yeah kind of porny! Apparently you actually see almost nothing though
21:24, 11 Feb - Slam: Did not not shim sham la beef was in it though, pretty sure I don't want to see his junk
22:39, 11 Feb - Owen James: A warning: that film is by lars von trier, his previous films have included a woman cutting off her own genitalia. He is FUCKED UP. So I doubt it will be what you are expecting.

13:45, 13 Feb - ‚Ä™+44 7545 989149‚Ä¨ joined
15:17, 13 Feb - Owen James: The game is coming together.  I have written all the rules. Which weekends are people free?
15:19, 13 Feb - Owen James: Btw dan. I have made a new game, a bit like the demon game but shorter and with more spies and moles and tailing and scavenger hunting. It is called cold war conundrum!
15:19, 13 Feb - ‚Ä™+44 7545 989149‚Ä¨: Eeeeexcellent...
15:20, 13 Feb - Owen James: Can I email you the rules and get your input before sharing with everyone. You were a great help with the demon game.
15:21, 13 Feb - Owen James: Are you danruddick@hotmail.com?
15:32, 13 Feb - Owen James: Hey in fact Bunn would you like to do this for your birthday? Part of the game is that it ends up in a pub anyway! A pub in which we could have pub lunch...
15:54, 13 Feb - Shaggy Crazy Horse: I don't see this happening on Sunday
15:55, 13 Feb - Owen James: Saturday?
15:55, 13 Feb - Owen James: Whats happening tonight by the way?
16:02, 13 Feb - Shaggy Crazy Horse: Depends. I'd like to slack around and see the Lego movie Saturday, also depends on the weather surely?

16:09, 13 Feb - Eliza Botts: Yeah, you definitely don't want to play the spy game in wet or windy weather.
16:26, 13 Feb - Owen James: The spy game is so good by the way!
16:26, 13 Feb - Owen James: I haven't played it yet.  But I think it is better than the demon game.
16:27, 13 Feb - Shaggy Crazy Horse: Gaming banter in gaming group please
16:27, 13 Feb - Owen James: This isn't gaming banter. This is for everyone.
16:28, 13 Feb - Shaggy Crazy Horse: Spy GAME
16:28, 13 Feb - Owen James: Except Sarah. She did not like the demon game.
16:29, 13 Feb - Owen James: Yeah but shaggy this is not a video game. This is a game that hopefully everyone will play.
16:30, 13 Feb - Owen James: Also "cold war conundrum" does not contain the word "spy"
16:30, 13 Feb - Owen James: Or the word "game"
16:30, 13 Feb - Shaggy Crazy Horse: You called it the spy game
16:31, 13 Feb - Owen James: Ok what topics are allowed in this group then baas?

18:48, 12 Mar - Bongo: @tegs game on for lunch, I'll ping you in the morning
18:49, 12 Mar - Bongo: They may say it's going to be sunny
18:49, 12 Mar - Vanessa "Beast" Matthews: Is that meant to be a nuance?
18:49, 12 Mar - Bongo: But I bet my monkey's uncle it's going to be cold and depressing
18:50, 12 Mar - Vanessa "Beast" Matthews: You don't have a monkey so you can't bet that
18:50, 12 Mar - Teegan: Dibs on bongo's monkey uncle
18:50, 12 Mar - Teegan: Sorry
18:50, 12 Mar - Bongo: They may say I don't have a monkey
18:50, 12 Mar - Teegan: Monkey's uncle
18:51, 12 Mar - Vanessa "Beast" Matthews: Nah still can't make a bet on that
18:51, 12 Mar - Bongo: Who's going to stop me?
18:51, 12 Mar - Vanessa "Beast" Matthews: Me
18:51, 12 Mar - Vanessa "Beast" Matthews: Phil don't listen to bongo's weather pessimism.  It's going to be glorious

18:53, 12 Mar - Teegan: Slam, how was the j'interview?
18:54, 12 Mar - Mike: bongo : mixing idioms like water off a camels back
18:55, 12 Mar - Teegan: It'll take more than two stones to get that camel through the eye of the beerholder
18:55, 12 Mar - Teegan: As bongo would say
18:56, 12 Mar - Bongo: Well said young grass hopper
18:57, 12 Mar - Teegan: Beer somewhere anyone?
18:58, 12 Mar - Bongo: Where are ye?
18:59, 12 Mar - Bongo: I could go for a quick one
18:59, 12 Mar - Teegan: At work still
18:59, 12 Mar - Teegan: I'm just giving a few minutes to Wills
19:00, 12 Mar - Bongo: I'm just leaving, could meet at that place on the corner
19:00, 12 Mar - Bongo: Prince something?
19:00, 12 Mar - Slam: I'm going to get drunk somewhere. Probably at that salsa bar, so I can swear at elegant people. Y'all welcome to join, but I won't tolerate joviality, frivolity or any other kind of monkey business
19:01, 12 Mar - Mike: That badly huh?
19:03, 12 Mar - Teegan: 10 mins?
19:04, 12 Mar - Bongo: Aight
19:04, 12 Mar - Bongo: I'm pretty much there now
19:04, 12 Mar - Bongo: Or are you talking to Sam?
19:05, 12 Mar - Slam: Actually really well, which had made me maudlin. Seems like I'm better at everything when I'm too hungover to stand up  by myself
19:06, 12 Mar - Bongo: Your vocab's gone out the hatch too
19:11, 12 Mar - Slam: I'll batten down my bellyaching
19:12, 12 Mar - Slam: You guys drinking around Blackfriars somewhere? Might pop over in a bit
19:13, 12 Mar - Teegan: Yeah m
19:13, 12 Mar - Teegan: In the albino
19:14, 12 Mar - Teegan: Albion
19:15, 12 Mar - Bongo: Yea I'm in there now
19:16, 12 Mar - Bongo: Hungover interviews are a tricky one
19:18, 12 Mar - Bongo: I never know whether it went really well because I was still drunk
19:18, 12 Mar - Bongo: But in retrospect they all went really well so I reckon we're onto something
20:38, 12 Mar - Dave Mendez: Anyone at c town? X
20:39, 12 Mar - Shaggy Crazy Horse: Not for a few hours
20:44, 12 Mar - Dave Mendez: Good lord

19:23, 13 Mar - Slam: The Phil requests some wine for the cooking, and also for his face
19:24, 13 Mar - Slam: I guess I've been designated his whatsapp interpreter
19:34, 13 Mar - Teegan: On my way back,  wineladen

09:05, 14 Mar - Mike: @bongo: the only thing keeping me awake is the pain
09:06, 14 Mar - ‚Ä™+61 405 567 873‚Ä¨: Bongo is awake ?
09:06, 14 Mar - ‚Ä™+61 405 567 873‚Ä¨: Bongo sleeps while he's standing up .....
09:07, 14 Mar - ‚Ä™+61 405 567 873‚Ä¨: Im still here , having computer illiterate troubles leaving thiis convo :p
09:23, 14 Mar - Shaggy Crazy Horse: Why are you trying to leave, you prawn?

09:26, 14 Mar - Shaggy Crazy Horse: Haha I feel fine now, I guess I'm made of sterner stuff
09:28, 14 Mar - Teegan: If you hit the settings buttom on your phone, you can leave groups through the 'group info' tab

13:06, 14 Mar - Owen James: What were all of you doing last night? And why would you get that smashed on a weekday night. Hangovers on Sunday are fine. A work day hangover is terrible. I did not enjoy Monday.
13:25, 14 Mar - Shaggy Crazy Horse: That's because you're a wuss
13:27, 14 Mar - Dave Mendez: Phil returned with schnaps and then went on a beer run. Of would have been rude not to drink!

17:38, 14 Mar - Dave Mendez: Why do a thing like that?
17:41, 14 Mar - Mike: Cause no point going ctown and back out again
17:42, 14 Mar - Mike: Rather get my reddit on for a bit
17:46, 14 Mar - Teegan: I'm in a bar in haggerston of you care to join
17:46, 14 Mar - Teegan: Canal side, nice aspect
17:49, 14 Mar - Mike: Ite, gona be bout an hour tho
17:53, 14 Mar - Teegan: I'm working for now, so I'm here for the long haul- no point in leaving as it's so close to islington
18:35, 14 Mar - Slam: I'm having a quick one in all bar one, Moorgate if anyone's passing by, we all up there for 8 otherwise?
18:43, 14 Mar - Teegan: location: https://maps.google.com/?q=51.5367737,-0.0784776
18:43, 14 Mar - Teegan: Wills and I are here
18:45, 14 Mar - Mike: I'm heading moorgate cause there's a direct train
19:04, 14 Mar - Owen James: We might be late. we missed our train and there are delays on northern line.
19:16, 14 Mar - Vanessa "Beast" Matthews: Does anyone have an iPhone 5 cable I could borrow over the weekend?
19:17, 14 Mar - Vanessa "Beast" Matthews: It's the same one used for the iPad mini
19:27, 14 Mar - Shaggy Crazy Horse: Don't have either of those things
19:41, 14 Mar - Mike: I made an awesome graph today
19:41, 14 Mar - Mike: The house numbers of properties sold in the last year. Spot the odd one out...
19:41, 14 Mar - Mike: <Media omitted>
19:47, 14 Mar - Owen James: 1!
19:47, 14 Mar - Owen James: And 13.
19:47, 14 Mar - Owen James: But I'm more interested in 1.
19:48, 14 Mar - Owen James: My initial thoughts were that if you had the only house on a street you wouldn't number it, you would name it.
19:49, 14 Mar - Owen James: Then I realised that surely for every house number 2 there would be a number 1 so they should at least be equal.
19:51, 14 Mar - Owen James: I come to the conclusion that if you own house 1 you are less likely to sell. I have yet to figure out why.
21:23, 14 Mar - Bongo: Reminds me of benford's law, that one's pretty messed up
21:24, 14 Mar - Owen James: Benfords law?
22:13, 14 Mar - Slam: You mean more likely to sell
22:15, 14 Mar - Owen James: 22:15
22:26, 14 Mar - Mike: Benfords law is where loads more statistics start with a 1 because they're exponentially distributed, eg longest rivers, CEO salaries etc
00:30, 15 Mar - Shaggy Crazy Horse: <Media omitted>
00:32, 15 Mar - Owen James: Oh. Yeah I knew about that, didn't know it was called benfords law. That why I was surprised by the fact that there were fewer 1s than 2s.
00:32, 15 Mar - Owen James: Night  night now.  Owen sleeps.
00:52, 15 Mar - Shaggy Crazy Horse: It's called "drink me". Unlike other cocktails they don't mix it, but just take out of the fridge, and give you a shot of apple juice in case it's too strong. It's not very tasty despite all the effort
11:20, 15 Mar - Bongo: Who's up for a partaay, I need something to keep my attention or I'm going to fall asleep
11:47, 15 Mar - Shaggy Crazy Horse: Going to see Lego movie now. Pub later?
11:58, 15 Mar - Bongo: Game on

12:38, 15 Mar - Bongo: Lol sounds good
12:39, 15 Mar - Owen James: Lol? Shaggy just stated a fact why did you lol?
12:43, 15 Mar - Bongo: The fact made me laugh
12:45, 15 Mar - Shaggy Crazy Horse: I didn't realise the grand Budapest hotel was the new wes Anderson film, I really want to see it!
12:48, 15 Mar - Owen James: It was good.
13:19, 15 Mar - Bongo: Just witnessed a pidgeon swallow a cigarette butt
13:19, 15 Mar - Bongo: Nearly vommed
13:21, 15 Mar - Bongo: Ctown never fails to surprise
14:32, 15 Mar - Shaggy Crazy Horse: You or the pidgeon?
15:09, 15 Mar - Bongo: Me
15:10, 15 Mar - Bongo: Pidge probably had the best meal in a week
15:42, 15 Mar - Marth: Hola hombres!! Brunch funday tomorrow at mine starting at midday? Blueberry pancakes etc. followed by board games and/or frisbee in the local park. Bring fruit, bacon, sausages, and perhaps the odd extra maple syrup &/ whatever else you might fancy. Mmm? Xxx

16:04, 15 Mar - Bongo: No brunch tomorrow
16:04, 15 Mar - Bongo: Elbow ski is 9 or something isn't it?
16:05, 15 Mar - Shaggy Crazy Horse: Brunch starts midday
16:06, 15 Mar - Bongo: Midday is subjective
16:07, 15 Mar - Bongo: I was hoping she'd give a time so that we could be 2 hours late
16:20, 15 Mar - Marth: Indeed, 12 midday. Rock up whenever, the only risk is that we'll have eaten all the pancakes innit. Yay phase 10!
18:30, 15 Mar - Vanessa "Beast" Matthews: I'm in for the movie. I'm just charging my phone at the apple shop. Where is everyone?
18:30, 15 Mar - Vanessa "Beast" Matthews: @martha not sure I can make it tomorrow. My brother is in town and wants to hang out

20:30, 15 Mar - Owen James: I think xav already has it. However we could make 8 player catan with a second expansion.
20:32, 15 Mar - Bunn: Nerds
20:33, 15 Mar - Bunn: ;)
20:51, 15 Mar - Mike: I'm a nerd and I don't even know what this is anymore

10:53, 18 Mar - Teegan: Work problem
10:54, 18 Mar - Teegan: Trying to import csv data into postgres- tried changing postgres encoding- do I need to do something to the csv file?
10:55, 18 Mar - Teegan: Answers on a postcard please
10:56, 18 Mar - Shaggy Crazy Horse: What encoding does csv have? Looks like it's in some sort of byte code, or whatever you're importing it into converts it to some weird byte code
10:56, 18 Mar - Teegan: How would I go about finding out about the byte code?
10:57, 18 Mar - Shaggy Crazy Horse: Can you open and read csv in notepad?
11:01, 18 Mar - Teegan: This is where my basic lack of computing ability comes into the fore! I will try
11:02, 18 Mar - Teegan: Yes I can!
11:04, 18 Mar - Owen James: It stands for comma seperated values. Its a really simple ascii encoding.  Each comma means a new cell and two commas means a new row.
11:05, 18 Mar - Shaggy Crazy Horse: So then Postgres is trying to read more into than required
11:06, 18 Mar - Shaggy Crazy Horse: Do you have any import options?
11:06, 18 Mar - Shaggy Crazy Horse changed the subject to ‚ÄúExpert CS think tank‚Äù
11:06, 18 Mar - Teegan: Sorry bunny, won't take long I'm sure- but asking these guys seemed like so much of a better option than asking the in house it support, who would spit at me and tell me they could do it next week
11:06, 18 Mar - Owen James: Probably. What program generated your csv file teegs?
11:06, 18 Mar - Bunn: Haha. I was making a joke!
11:07, 18 Mar - Teegan: I have some:
11:07, 18 Mar - Owen James: ???
11:08, 18 Mar - Teegan: <Media omitted>
11:08, 18 Mar - Teegan: Sad to it was excel, O
11:08, 18 Mar - Owen James: That should work
11:08, 18 Mar - Teegan: (You guys are heroes)
11:08, 18 Mar - Owen James: I'm not sure how it will handle row delimeters though
11:09, 18 Mar - Owen James: I don't know or use postges. I just have used csvs a lot in the past.
11:09, 18 Mar - Teegan: I did the same process with another excel csv and it worked a charm
11:09, 18 Mar - Owen James: Cool.
11:09, 18 Mar - Owen James: So no problem anymore?
11:09, 18 Mar - Teegan: No, there is a problem with this one
11:10, 18 Mar - Shaggy Crazy Horse: Go to file options
11:11, 18 Mar - Teegan: <Media omitted>
11:11, 18 Mar - Shaggy Crazy Horse: Encoding empty?
11:11, 18 Mar - Owen James: Utf8
11:11, 18 Mar - Owen James: That should work.
11:12, 18 Mar - Shaggy Crazy Horse: Clearly not UTF8 given the error
11:12, 18 Mar - Owen James: I am pretty sure csvs are utf8
11:12, 18 Mar - Owen James: Oh yeah.
11:12, 18 Mar - Owen James: Odd.
11:13, 18 Mar - Shaggy Crazy Horse: Can you export csv again?
11:13, 18 Mar - Teegan: The file is in French so contains accents- looking at
Stackoverflow etc I thought that might be messing stuff up...?
11:13, 18 Mar - Mike: The error looks like it was missing the commas
11:13, 18 Mar - Shaggy Crazy Horse: So probably IS in UTF8
11:14, 18 Mar - Teegan: Looking at it in notepad there aren't any commas around null values
11:14, 18 Mar - Owen James: Open it in excel and then save with a known encoding.
11:15, 18 Mar - Shaggy Crazy Horse: Go to null options
11:15, 18 Mar - Owen James: There wouldn't be.
11:17, 18 Mar - Teegan: <Media omitted>
11:18, 18 Mar - Shaggy Crazy Horse: How is null shown in csv?
11:18, 18 Mar - Owen James: Depends. Normally just blank , , sometimes , "",
11:18, 18 Mar - Teegan: <Media omitted>
11:19, 18 Mar - Teegan: Blank here
11:19, 18 Mar - Owen James: Yeah
11:19, 18 Mar - Shaggy Crazy Horse: That's fine. You have a header in file though and it's not ticked in misc options
11:19, 18 Mar - Teegan: Don't worry, it's not very confidential
11:20, 18 Mar - Teegan: So header file ticked and utf8 encoding?
11:21, 18 Mar - Shaggy Crazy Horse: Encoding should be detected automatically. It's could also be UTF16 or some other numbers, try with it blank doff auto detection
11:21, 18 Mar - Teegan: Both give the same error as before
11:22, 18 Mar - Owen James: What is on trans_customer line 2?
11:23, 18 Mar - Owen James: You might have an invalid charcter or something?
11:24, 18 Mar - Teegan: Trans_customer is the table I'm importing into... so there's nothing there yet...
11:24, 18 Mar - Owen James: is that the whole table or one of the headings?
11:25, 18 Mar - Teegan: I'll check my table defs
11:25, 18 Mar - Teegan: Whole table
11:25, 18 Mar - Mike: Do any of your columns have commas in them?
12:14, 18 Mar - Shaggy Crazy Horse changed the subject to ‚ÄúThe horde‚Äù
11:25, 18 Mar - Mike: To be safe you should put quotes around strings when you save them to csv
11:26, 18 Mar - Shaggy Crazy Horse: Excel will do that for you
11:26, 18 Mar - Teegan: Good point- some of the character ones do. .. I don't know if it's got as far as reading those though
11:26, 18 Mar - Teegan: Ok
11:26, 18 Mar - Shaggy Crazy Horse: Trying playing around with the encoding in file options
11:26, 18 Mar - Shaggy Crazy Horse: Try*
11:27, 18 Mar - Owen James: Not always shaggy.  It's an option. An option that it doesn't look like it was ticked judging by the notepad screenshot.
11:27, 18 Mar - Teegan: Good detdctive work y'all- would I do that when I save?
11:28, 18 Mar - Shaggy Crazy Horse: Not on my excel, maybe yours is rustic
11:28, 18 Mar - Owen James: Try reexporting your csv from excel teegs. Choose a known haracter encoding and tick whatever option it is to put inverted commas around strings. It might be called encapsulate strings.
11:29, 18 Mar - Teegan: Ok,  I'm hoping to have a play
11:30, 18 Mar - Owen James: Oh you are right. Excel 2010 doesn't have that.
11:30, 18 Mar - Teegan: I am in office 13, and I don't seem to have options when I export
11:31, 18 Mar - Teegan: Stoopid microsoft taking away my autonomy
11:32, 18 Mar - Owen James: Hmm. I just tried it out and shaggy is right. On newer versions of excel it automatically adds " where necessary.
11:32, 18 Mar - Teegan: Oh. Then clever Microsoft.
11:52, 18 Mar - Teegan: Thanks anyway guys-I'll owe you a pint for the half hour of work time I just stole from you
11:53, 18 Mar - Owen James: Im home ill anyway.

18:15, 18 Mar - Dave Mendez: How goes your leaving Tegs? Did you recover your passport? X
19:09, 18 Mar - Teegan: Passport recovered, leaving underway. I have once again arrived at Heathrow early to find that there is nothing in my pay bracket to distract me.  Grue. Still, dinner on its way- let the expensing commence! X
19:10, 18 Mar - Shaggy Crazy Horse: Wait what? You didn't fly yesterday?
19:11, 18 Mar - Teegan: My passport was in Belgium! Fail. But all sorted now.
19:11, 18 Mar - Teegan: Tonight we fly
19:11, 18 Mar - Shaggy Crazy Horse: Why?
19:12, 18 Mar - Teegan: I'm going to Mali after I'm done in Tanzania, for which I belatedly realised I needed a visa. Their closest embassy is in Belgium, so I sent my passport of last week... But failed to book a return courier

12:01, 24 Mar - Bunn: Is that how sausage dogs sit??
13:34, 24 Mar - Owen James: The sum of all the natural numbers is equal to (-1/12). This is crazy! Mathematicians arise and explain!
13:37, 24 Mar - Slam: What do you mean by natural numbers? It usually refers to counting numbers, which you can't sum
13:37, 24 Mar - Owen James: 1+2+3+4......
13:38, 24 Mar - Slam: You can't sum that, you can sum OVER the natural numbers, but you can't add them
13:39, 24 Mar - Owen James: Why not?
13:39, 24 Mar - Slam: Email me whatever you're looking at, before Bunn notices there's maths on the horde
13:40, 24 Mar - Owen James: Numberphile sum of natural numbers youtube.
13:46, 24 Mar - Owen James: There are two proofs.  One of which uses the reimann zeta function.
13:52, 24 Mar - Mike: Lol, bad horde chat. If you analytically continue the Riemann zeta function and evaluate at -1 that's what you get. Kinda cheating though. As written the series is clearly divergent.
13:58, 24 Mar - Owen James: I don't really get what makes a series divegent though. Because 1/1+1/2+1/3 +1/4... is divergent. Even though it feels like it shouldn't be.
13:59, 24 Mar - Owen James: Why is it cheating?
14:04, 24 Mar - Mike: This is quite complicated... Zeta(x) is well defined for real x>1. For x<= 1 the series is not convergent. There's a thing called analytic continuation where roughly you find a function which agrees with your function where it is defined and is analytic (read infinitely differentiable) on a compact subset of the complex numbers.
14:06, 24 Mar - Mike: But the analytic continuation is not the same as the original function. So it doesn't make sense to use the series definition of zeta for x<1 and say zeta(-1) = 1+2+3+....
14:10, 24 Mar - Owen James: That is what they guy did in the video.  He did zeta(2) and then took away 2.zeta (-2) or something.  I forget exactly how he did it. It feels like cheating.
14:14, 24 Mar - Mike: We should start a nerd horde group or something...
14:15, 24 Mar - Owen James: Nah. Let the prols that inhabit this thread learn something.
14:16, 24 Mar - Owen James: Also apparently 1-1+1-1+1-1.... is divergent.  Which makes no sense!
14:24, 24 Mar - Dave Mendez: Well it doesn't converge to anything. Depending on how you cluster the sums it appears it could converge to 0 or 1. In general for an infinite series to be convergent the underlying sequence being summed must converge to zero.
14:26, 24 Mar - Slam: It's been ages since we've had a pointlessly nerdy argument about something, it's not a much fun sober and writing, let's get drunk and do this again sometime

10:36, 30 Mar - Mike: I just made it look like we stole your hat and left it at the park because it pleased me
10:36, 30 Mar - Teegan: Sweet. Go with my blessing. And your hat :)

16:25, 31 Mar - Owen James: Nah I'll just stay at home. I have way too much work to do.

14:00, 1 Apr - Slam: Haha nice one! Was that on look mum no hands? Love that place, they fixed up my breaks for free
18:10, 1 Apr - Vanessa "Beast" Matthews: I could kill for a coffee

19:40, 1 Apr - Bunn: Loving how light it still is!
19:42, 1 Apr - Vanessa "Beast" Matthews: Are you still at the pub?
19:42, 1 Apr - Dave Mendez: Yea

09:31, 2 Apr - Mike: Odysseus would be proud. Excellent burgering y'all

09:47, 2 Apr - Slam: Yeah, drink until the sensible people have gone home!
18:44, 2 Apr - Bunn: If anyone wants a taste card for ¬£30 instead of ¬£80 use code MENU8
Plus you get a free ¬£23 cork screw!
18:45, 2 Apr - Bunn: <Media omitted>
18:52, 2 Apr - Mike: Man what does a ¬£23 corkscrew look like?
18:53, 2 Apr - Mike: Couldn't you buy a robot butler for that kind of money?
19:44, 2 Apr - Shaggy Crazy Horse: 29.99 + 3xFREE = 102.99
19:44, 2 Apr - Shaggy Crazy Horse: That's math
20:23, 2 Apr - Bongo: That's numberwang
20:23, 2 Apr - Bongo: What's a taste card?
22:27, 2 Apr - Bunn: 50% off at certain restaurants
22:27, 2 Apr - Bunn: Like chico banditos
09:50, 3 Apr - Marth: Dave & Mike - from our discussion the other night: you can infer the (fact-checked) arguments for and against EU here: http://www.buzzfeed.com/owenspottiswoode/12-things-we-learned-from-nick-clegg-and-nigel-far-nmzm?s=mobile
09:56, 3 Apr - Dave Mendez: Cheers Marth. God bless the facts. X
10:06, 3 Apr - Owen James: Interesting. Apparently like 70% people think farage won the debate according to the guardian.
10:08, 3 Apr - Owen James: I personally don't care. I just don't think that in a democracy politicians really have that much power. Gove is trying his best to fuck up education and still isn't really making a dent.
10:32, 3 Apr - Dave Mendez: From all accounts I'm reading Andrew Lansley's Health and Social Care Act has essentially privatised the NHS. I'd keep my eyes on politicians - it's when we stop watching them that the shit hits the fan.
10:34, 3 Apr - Owen James: What yah gonna do. As long as I don't have to pay for health insurance.
10:34, 3 Apr - Owen James: Which I never will. If any politician suggested such a thing there would be a recall election or a vote of no confidence.
11:30, 3 Apr - Vanessa "Beast" Matthews: I'm looking for new tunes, anybody have any suggestions?
11:32, 3 Apr - Owen James: Sting and The Police!
11:32, 3 Apr - Owen James: Blondie
11:32, 3 Apr - Owen James: Eric satie
11:33, 3 Apr - Owen James: Yes
11:33, 3 Apr - Owen James: Rush
11:42, 3 Apr - ‚Ä™+44 7807 744465‚Ä¨: Hiatus kaiyote
11:42, 3 Apr - ‚Ä™+44 7807 744465‚Ä¨: Moonchild
11:53, 3 Apr - Vanessa "Beast" Matthews: Thanks!
18:37, 3 Apr - Mike: Thanks for the link Marth. My gut definitely says it would be dumb to leave the EU, but all the arguments I see either for or against it seem very vague and notional...
18:38, 3 Apr - Mike: Also I reckon the yougov poll was probly skewed by the fact that people hate clegg
19:11, 3 Apr - Owen James: I would like to see stats on how much import and export tax is saved by being in the EU.
19:12, 3 Apr - Owen James: Also I think the reasons for being part of it are vague and complicated whereas the reasons for not being part basically boil down to saving a small amount of money and stopping immigration.
19:16, 3 Apr - Owen James: I am fairly sure I am pro EU not because of its benefits (I don't really know what they are) but because I don't think the arguments against it are compelling. I am basically anti xenophobe. And apparently included in that set is being pro European union.
20:06, 3 Apr - Teegan: I am pro eu because I fully dig passing through Borders with no problems
20:07, 3 Apr - Teegan: Liberte! Egalite! Fraternite!
20:07, 3 Apr - Teegan: (No accents, sorry French)
20:13, 3 Apr - Owen James: I agree with you. That seems like a pretty small reason. I am fairly sure the EU is actually fairly inconsequential though.
20:14, 3 Apr - Teegan: It feels like the closest thing to idealism which we still have a commitment to
21:29, 3 Apr - Slam: Arguing against the eu just feels like xenophobic atavism, I'd love it if there were poignant arguments for Britain to be a member for itself, but I feel completely happy with the idea that we make a net loss, with a huge gain in other countries
21:29, 3 Apr - Slam: Looking over the history of colonial Britain, I think we owe the world a bit
21:34, 3 Apr - Alan Wright: The only way human society can overcome the worlds problems (environment, war, inequality, crime, etc) is through political globalisation. The eu is a big step in that direction. Even if Britain gained did gain by leaving the eu, theres bigger issues at play here than just being 1 or 2% wealthier.
21:35, 3 Apr - Alan Wright: Anyone around for post work beers tomorrow night?
21:35, 3 Apr - Mike: I don't know that immigration is good for other countries though. Seems like a lot of poorer countries lose a lot of bright people that way
21:41, 3 Apr - Mike: Beers beers beers. Just saw your email, Alan, where are you guys off to?
21:54, 3 Apr - Alan Wright: Vietnam (probably).  To Danang
00:11, 4 Apr - Teegan: Waaaah

22:50, 11 May - Shaggy Crazy Horse: I thought it was ninth
23:25, 11 May - ‚Ä™+44 7807 744465‚Ä¨: End of the week meant Sunday not Friday I think xx
07:37, 12 May - Mike: Quote from the review of the Postman Pat movie I just read:
07:37, 12 May - Mike: "The murderous bionic cat shooting lasers out of its eyes proved a turning point"
10:37, 12 May - Bongo: Lol sounds intriguing
10:57, 12 May - ‚Ä™+44 7807 744465‚Ä¨: My aunt is one of the original illustrators of postman pat books :)
11:03, 12 May - Owen James: Big deal! My aunt is that bionic lazer eye cat!

12:03, 12 May - Mike: They're good at operating on cataracts
12:03, 12 May - Mike: I feel dirty about that last post

12:13, 12 May - ‚Ä™+44 7545 989149‚Ä¨: So who else heard very bad reviews of Godzilla?
12:14, 12 May - ‚Ä™+44 7545 989149‚Ä¨: I hope its a big plan to lower my Godzilla sized expectations, before absolutely smashing them later...
12:19, 12 May - Mike: 85% on rotten tomatoes
12:22, 12 May - ‚Ä™+44 7545 989149‚Ä¨: I saw a couple of 2 star reviews knocking about. Might be people who accidentally watched the Matthew Broderick version though...
12:23, 12 May - Mike: I must be the only one who liked that film
12:23, 12 May - Mike: It had bloody Godzilla in it. People are too fussy.
12:38, 12 May - Owen James: I'm the same mike.
12:40, 12 May - ‚Ä™+44 7545 989149‚Ä¨: I went to see it in the cinema for my birthday. Thought it was great. Haven't seen it since though...
12:40, 12 May - Owen James: Eliza keeps trying to tell me its a bad film but we always come back to its one redeaming feature.  It has godzilla in it. Seriously godzilla adds about the same amount to a film as a film being the film taxi driver adds to a film.
12:41, 12 May - Owen James: Dan it had gozilla in it. Therefore it was great!
12:42, 12 May - ‚Ä™+44 7545 989149‚Ä¨: I thought I might have imagined that in my 11 year old birthday excitement and sugar rush.
12:42, 12 May - ‚Ä™+44 7545 989149‚Ä¨: Glad to hear it was real.
13:53, 12 May - Shaggy Crazy Horse: If rotten tomatoes says it's good then I'm going to hate that film. Joy
17:31, 12 May - ‚Ä™+44 7807 744465‚Ä¨: Hi guys is anyone back at canning town yet? Shaggy is at drumming till later but I wanna come for meat Monday within the next hour. Will anyone be there to let me in? Will anyone talk to me?
17:32, 12 May - Mike: Phil'll be in, he doesn't check WhatsApp much tho
17:33, 12 May - Shaggy Crazy Horse: Or door bell.
17:39, 12 May - Mike: If you do decide to climb the fence, be careful of the barbed wire
17:56, 12 May - p tschismarov: I'm here. I'll let you in.
19:21, 12 May - Marth: On my way! 40mins x

10:25, 13 May - Slam: Homemade burgers? Or did you find some secret Burgeria?
11:54, 13 May - p tschismarov: Mike is referring to the thick slabs of pork that were marinating the entire day. They were crazy tasty. Def getting the meat from the morrisons butchers from now on.
12:59, 13 May - Slam: Sounds most boday, sorry I missed it!
13:00, 13 May - Slam: Is there any left? Sounds like a perfect post climbing snack, if it survives that long
13:17, 13 May - p tschismarov: I reckon I'll turn the leftovers into some kind of pie tonite. Can't guarantee how long it'll survive tho.
13:42, 13 May - Teegan: Mmmmmmpie
13:42, 13 May - Teegan: Yo slam- what is the branding on your vapour tool guy? Why is it better than cheaper ones?
15:02, 13 May - Slam: Truvape is the name of the flame, I did zero research into it except trying Nialls once, so there's probably a better product out there
15:03, 13 May - Slam: If you think it it a buying 4 packs it cigarettes, which will last about 2 months, it makes the thing seen really cheap though, and they've got food customer service so far. I'm a fan
15:03, 13 May - Slam: Mmmmpie sounds delicious, I'll get the climbing out the way asap
15:53, 13 May - Shaggy Crazy Horse: Please disable swype, you type like a crazy tape worm on a dance machine
16:10, 13 May - Owen James: Swype increases speed by 50%. But you end up having to explain more than half your mesages so it saves no time in the long run.
16:54, 13 May - p tschismarov: Only if you're a Diaz
16:57, 13 May - Slam: Wood

12:23, 16 May - p tschismarov: There's other parks? Something easy for people to reach. Maybe near London bridge.
12:45, 16 May - Slam: Sounds good, don't think I'm getting out before 6.30, let's do new change on a mid week evening so we've got a chance of a seat
13:37, 16 May - Shaggy Crazy Horse: Park sounds lush, unfortunately there's not much around London bridge, kennington park is nice
14:00, 16 May - Slam: What about that little one by borough? We'd have the glad when things get dingy
14:02, 16 May - Shaggy Crazy Horse: There are a few small parks around, they are not wonderful but some are quite homely.

08:53, 28 May - Slam: So I've bought some mud guards that don't fit my bike, anyone have a mountain bike that needs some? Free to a good home
09:57, 28 May - Owen James: God damn you Sam you sneaky bastard! I just figured out why my phone keyboard was behaving so weirdly!!!
10:14, 28 May - Slam: Mwahahahah! Also, I got the reddit app, win all round!
10:34, 28 May - Angela: I'm intrigued, what happened to your keyboard??
10:57, 28 May - Henry Franks: dont get the reddit app youll never get anything done ever again!
10:58, 28 May - Angela: ...I'm gonna get the reddit app
10:58, 28 May - Bunn: I dont like doing things either
10:58, 28 May - Henry Franks: haha
10:59, 28 May - Slam: Some gangster turned off auto spacing and auto capitalisation, that's what happened
10:59, 28 May - Slam: I feel like I'm graduating Henry, imgur app has taken my hours for too long!
11:01, 28 May - Henry Franks: there is better stuff on reddit, try /r/showerthoughts and /r/Britishproblems
11:03, 28 May - Henry Franks: what tv are ppl watching atm? im stuck at home ill and need something to binge
11:04, 28 May - Angela: Have you watched the US office? Great binging fodder
11:05, 28 May - Henry Franks: Actually I never saw that I always assumed it was rubbish
11:06, 28 May - Angela: Get past the first few episodes, which try to copy the uk one, and then it gets going and is really funny
11:09, 28 May - Owen James: It was some very subtle trolling Sam. I kept just thinking my fingers had got fatter or something.
11:09, 28 May - Owen James: Yeah once you get to the second series it is a lot better.
11:10, 28 May - Owen James: The first series just try to copy the British one. But because they are American they don't seem to get the humor.
11:10, 28 May - Angela: They can't do it half as cringey and awkward
11:11, 28 May - Angela: I liked it from the first few episodes though
11:16, 28 May - Henry Franks: sweet, full day of tv binging sorted
11:31, 28 May - Mike: The toilets at my work are like a Faraday cage, so I can't look at reddit at work without my boss seeing :(
11:32, 28 May - Angela: Your boss sounds creepy!
11:39, 28 May - Bunn: Gross dude
11:39, 28 May - Bunn: My toilet naps would be busted
11:40, 28 May - Bunn: Iv spent the morning listening to GoT audiobooks on youtube
11:40, 28 May - Bunn: So much easier than actually doing the reading
11:45, 28 May - Slam: You're my hero Bunn, taking lethargy to new levels
11:46, 28 May - Slam: You listen while you work? I got a bollocking for wearing headphones once. I need a new job...
11:47, 28 May - Angela: What! I quite often watch tv at work and people are fine with it
11:50, 28 May - Henry Franks: yea you defo need a new job sam, Id go crazy if I couldnt listen to headphones at work!
11:51, 28 May - Bunn: Hope you asked that Q for your new job mate!
12:35, 28 May - Slam: Hah yeah, first thing I asked
12:37, 28 May - Slam: For those bemused, I've got a new job, starting June 23rd, I'm thinking celebration meal on the 19th to ease into tandem festival. Save the date
12:56, 28 May - Mike: Man your old place sounds dumb. Sometimes I just put my headphones in with no sound on, it's better than ambient noise!
13:05, 28 May - Teegan: I want headphones that play silence
13:05, 28 May - Teegan: Then I will know I live in the future
13:11, 28 May - Mike: Noise cancelling headphones aren't that expensive these days, like ¬£40 for a cheap pair?
13:24, 28 May - Shaggy Crazy Horse: Cheap headphones that claim to do expensive things are a waste of money
13:29, 28 May - Mike: I think expensive headphones are a waste of money, there I said it
13:30, 28 May - Shaggy Crazy Horse: Maybe on your ears
13:31, 28 May - Henry Franks: I dunno man good headphones are heavenly,  I used to go thru a pair every six months till I shelled out for good ones, theyve lasted 5 years
13:43, 28 May - Mike: Yeah longevity is a good point. I leave mine at work though, use inner ear on commute, so doesn't matter so much.
13:51, 28 May - Mike: I think audiophiles are kidding themselves though. Its like high end wine tasting.
13:58, 28 May - Slam: I'm pretty sure it's just what your used to, going back to computer speakers when you've been listening to real ones for a little while is painful, you never realise how bad the quality is
14:00, 28 May - Slam: And I'll never forgive Vanessa for educating me about burgers. Now I know what they're supposed to taste like, I can't even finish a McDonald's
14:01, 28 May - Henry Franks: its a hard life bro
14:12, 28 May - Bunn: That was her plan all alonh
14:12, 28 May - Bunn: Along*
14:12, 28 May - Bunn: You got schooled sukka
14:17, 28 May - Bunn: Legend goes shaggy had 3 maccyD bfasts on monday
14:17, 28 May - Bunn: And he doesnt remember it
15:01, 28 May - Mike: He didn't give me any
15:01, 28 May - Mike: Bastard
15:16, 28 May - Owen James: So it turns out that although your bosses seem to not want you taking a shit or wearing headphones they are perfectly happy with you spending the day on wassap Óêï
15:19, 28 May - Slam: Hah, I was just thinking the same, think I need to turn my phone off for the afternoon
15:21, 28 May - Bongo: Yea TL;DR
15:22, 28 May - Bongo: They need some sort of summarising feature to condense all of today's messages into a one liner
15:23, 28 May - Mike: In a meeting lol
15:24, 28 May - Mike: A really long boring one
16:31, 28 May - Teegan: Noise cancelling headphones cancel out amvient noise when you're playing music
16:31, 28 May - Teegan: I just want them to play silence
16:31, 28 May - Teegan: Deafening silence
16:32, 28 May - Teegan: Arthur c clarke wrote about it many years ago and they still haven't been invented
16:32, 28 May - Teegan: Sci fi fail
16:38, 28 May - ‚Ä™+44 7794 501335‚Ä¨: Hey guys. Having drinks and dinner on the southbank later if anyone's up for it! Cxx

17:28, 28 May - Owen James: You could get noise cancelling headphones and play that silent John Cage symphony teens.
17:28, 28 May - Owen James: Tees.

19:57, 28 May - Owen James: I'm at South bank where are peeps?
19:58, 28 May - Owen James: Also those album recommendations were rubbish. I ended up having to listen to the John Cage silent symphony.
20:14, 28 May - Bongo: Do you like mellow stuff?
20:16, 28 May - Bongo: Wax tailor or hundred waters
20:16, 28 May - Bongo: Any of their albums

12:20, 29 May - Angela: I might be. A couple of vague plans which may not happen. Where are you thinking?
12:27, 29 May - Alan Wright: Anything goes really. Perhaps one of the pubs on the river near lb?
12:30, 29 May - Angela: Sounds lovely. If my work drinks don't materialise (pretty likely) and jason hasn't bought us tickets to the cinema already (semi-likely as he's very excited about xmen) then I'm in!

09:09, 30 May - Teegan: Even 24 is a bit sparse
09:11, 30 May - Mike: There were about 8 when I joined it was just C town Hannah and cate I think
09:13, 30 May - Teegan: Rubbish horde
09:13, 30 May - Teegan: Lovely group of people
09:14, 30 May - Slam: That made a posse at most
09:14, 30 May - Shaggy Crazy Horse: That was my hoard. Now it's my horde
09:15, 30 May - Mike: Can one of the original peeps do me a favour? Go to main menu, click on three dots, settings, chat settings, email conversation and email the whole horde chat as a text file to me?
09:16, 30 May - Mike: Mine only goes back to when I broke my phone, wana do some stats on it!
09:17, 30 May - ‚Ä™+44 7807 744465‚Ä¨: Stats mike?
09:18, 30 May - Bunn: <Media omitted>
09:18, 30 May - Mike: Yeah it is kind of my job lol
09:18, 30 May - Mike: Lol I meant stats not alcoholism
09:19, 30 May - Bunn: Unrelated pic but funny
09:20, 30 May - Bunn: Got a spare ticket to see the glitch mob at the forum tonight
09:20, 30 May - Bunn: Anyone interested?
09:20, 30 May - Angela: I'm interested in that leaflet...
09:28, 30 May - Shaggy Crazy Horse: Lol
09:54, 30 May - Slam: I sent something Mike, don't know if it's what you're after!
10:37, 30 May - Teegan: http://www.wageningenur.nl/en/Expertise-Services/Research-Institutes/lei/show/Significantly-fewer-pigs-castrated-over-the-past-five-years.htm
10:37, 30 May - Teegan: Best headline I've seen in a whole
10:37, 30 May - Teegan: While
10:37, 30 May - Teegan: I like my job :)
10:39, 30 May - Owen James: Mike you should do stats on who comments most. And who gets mentioned most. Then do the ratio of the two. Then we could finally have what we all have been waiting for: an objective measure of who is the most popular.
10:39, 30 May - Henry Franks: haha thats amazing, I didnt realise pig castration came under the remit of your job tegs
10:40, 30 May - Teegan: It's an agile role :)
10:40, 30 May - Shaggy Crazy Horse: Oh snap check who's a twitter celebrity https://mobile.twitter.com/chloelast/media/grid?idx=0&tid=472101577353068544
10:40, 30 May - Henry Franks: surely a normalised number of mentions is better, if you incorporate comment counts then prolific commenters would feature better...and yoid have to take into account time spent in the group too
10:41, 30 May - Teegan: Doing some post workshop networking there shags
10:41, 30 May - Shaggy Crazy Horse: With my coworker lol
10:43, 30 May - Owen James: No Henry. I think the person who doesn't comment much but gets mentioned a lot has the highest comment efficacy. And therefore is the objectively best person.
10:44, 30 May - Teegan: Even if we keep calling them a cunt?
10:44, 30 May - Owen James: Shaggy that link doesn't work for me.  Who is it?
10:44, 30 May - Henry Franks: I think thats an assumption that needs testing before you can claim objectivity :)
10:44, 30 May - Shaggy Crazy Horse: Ce moi
10:45, 30 May - Henry Franks: plus tegs makes a good point how does it take into account sentiment?
10:45, 30 May - Owen James: Owen Owen Owen Owen Owen Owen owen
10:45, 30 May - Shaggy Crazy Horse: Does that count as a self mention? Am I boosting my popularity of self-centredness?
10:45, 30 May - Henry Franks: I wonder what the stats would be for proportion of whatsapping done on fridays
10:46, 30 May - Shaggy Crazy Horse: Or Mondays
10:48, 30 May - Henry Franks: would be quite interesting to do a sentiment analysis by day too, bet were all happier on fridays

18:40, 30 May - Bunn: Contiguous? Great word!

00:16, 3 Jun - Owen James: Doh'
00:16, 3 Jun - ‚Ä™+44 7545 989149‚Ä¨: Yes. Half an hour after you.
00:16, 3 Jun - ‚Ä™+44 7545 989149‚Ä¨: Your cries of Oberyn were... confusing.
00:20, 3 Jun - Slam: My good I miss that guy already
00:21, 3 Jun - Shaggy Crazy Horse: Óçä
00:21, 3 Jun - Shaggy Crazy Horse: OBERGYN
00:22, 3 Jun - Mike: This is the first episode that's made me reconsider whether I should keep watching
00:22, 3 Jun - Mike: I think I'm at a net loss having watched
00:23, 3 Jun - Dave Mendez: Agreed. I just sat out on the steps of the boat in the dark stunned. A duck saved me. Quack.
00:23, 3 Jun - Slam: Obergone
00:24, 3 Jun - Mike: I imagine this is what it feels like to support a shit football team
00:24, 3 Jun - Mike: Like Arsenal
00:27, 3 Jun - Owen James: Shaggy I wish I could upvote your Óçä
00:28, 3 Jun - Eliza Botts: That sounds rude.
06:58, 3 Jun - Mike: Still sulking this morning
06:58, 3 Jun - Mike: Stupid show
07:26, 3 Jun - Owen James: Are you sulking because the mountain was skull king!
08:05, 3 Jun - ‚Ä™+44 7807 744465‚Ä¨: Wake n sulk
08:59, 3 Jun - Bunn: I'm over it already
09:00, 3 Jun - Bunn: Hopefully more badasses from Dorne will show up
09:01, 3 Jun - Owen James: Lets talk about nice things: grey worm has a crush Óêò
09:01, 3 Jun - Owen James: Unfortunately so did obyron.
09:03, 3 Jun - ‚Ä™+44 7807 744465‚Ä¨: Awwww Bunn you were so forlorn last night
09:04, 3 Jun - Bunn: I was Óêì
09:05, 3 Jun - Bunn: Shouldv seen it coming
09:05, 3 Jun - Bunn: Tricked again!
09:07, 3 Jun - Mike: Feel like a beaten housewife who keeps going back
09:08, 3 Jun - Mike: That bug crushing scene was totally about GRRM
09:08, 3 Jun - Mike: WHAT DOES HE GET OUT OF IT?
09:09, 3 Jun - Bunn: Lol
09:09, 3 Jun - Bunn: Good one
11:31, 3 Jun - Bunn: Haha
11:31, 3 Jun - Bunn: Check this
11:31, 3 Jun - Bunn: <Media omitted>
11:33, 3 Jun - Marth: Ew!!! Bunn! I'm trying to forget!!
11:32, 3 Jun - p tschismarov: Where is this from?
11:33, 3 Jun - Bunn: Imgur comments on this pic
11:33, 3 Jun - Bunn: <Media omitted>
11:38, 3 Jun - Owen James: The mountain is fucking scary in real life as well. Obyron is fucking hansome in real life as well.
11:44, 3 Jun - Shaggy Crazy Horse: It's oberyn
11:46, 3 Jun - Owen James: No its oybooring!
11:51, 3 Jun - ‚Ä™+44 7545 989149‚Ä¨: OberWIN! ...Wait....
12:45, 3 Jun - Mike: <Media omitted>
13:46, 3 Jun - Bunn: http://mccomseycomix.files.wordpress.com
13:47, 3 Jun - Bunn: (Rest of comic)
13:52, 3 Jun - Slam: That comic made me sad all over again. Great style though
14:07, 3 Jun - Shaggy Crazy Horse: I like how he went nuts on the audience too
14:10, 3 Jun - Mike: Yeah I read that in the book he cuts a woman in half
14:11, 3 Jun - Mike: Duno why they left that out
14:12, 3 Jun - Slam: Different setup, the cartoon looks more like a street brawl, the show was in a proper stadium
14:14, 3 Jun - Shaggy Crazy Horse: So was the book
14:18, 3 Jun - Slam: Just rewatched that scene, so brutal! Even just the punch would end the fight
14:53, 3 Jun - Teegan: When Mike does the analysis I suspect we'll find that oberyn's head exploding is one of the most impudent events in the history of the horde
14:53, 3 Jun - Teegan: Or indeed in our lives
14:55, 3 Jun - Bunn: Next week is gonna be even better
15:34, 3 Jun - Dave Mendez: I'm expecting oberyn's head to reassemble like the T-1000 before he leads all the women of kings landing into the sea.
15:38, 3 Jun - Owen James: Why would he lead them to sea. Surely he would lead them to his bedroom because he is a massive slut.
15:40, 3 Jun - Vanessa "Beast" Matthews: I had my eyes shut half the episode. Did the big guy also die pretty much a sec after he killed Ob?
15:42, 3 Jun - Dave Mendez: It seems more poetic that way. Pied piper style. Plus he can take them all to the afterlife and slut them there.
15:42, 3 Jun - Dave Mendez: Slut
15:43, 3 Jun - Dave Mendez: What a horrible word
15:43, 3 Jun - ‚Ä™+44 7545 989149‚Ä¨: Try Hussy instead.
15:43, 3 Jun - Dave Mendez: Cheers Dan. He is more of a hussy.
15:47, 3 Jun - Kritzia: I had my eyes shut as well, but the Spanish guy was pretty handsome!! And now I'm kind of getting the story I think!! :(
15:48, 3 Jun - Kritzia: Hopefully he'll be back.from the after life... I'm now interested :p
15:56, 3 Jun - Alan Wright: Hey guys. If anyone is around, me and cat and some random others are going to be having a few beers at the George in London bridge tonight from 7. Come along if you are around! X
16:13, 3 Jun - Shaggy Crazy Horse: Working late, so I might pop around in the evening
17:36, 3 Jun - Slam: Climbing just now, might I over after
17:37, 3 Jun - Slam: *I might
19:06, 3 Jun - Teegan: <Media omitted>
19:06, 3 Jun - Teegan: Check out who is supporting the Richard Hamilton exhibition
19:08, 3 Jun - Marth: Ha.
19:08, 3 Jun - Marth: Nice spot
19:11, 3 Jun - Teegan: Tickled me
19:12, 3 Jun - Angela: Seems perfectly logical to me
19:13, 3 Jun - Owen James: No no no. "The Richard Hamilton" is a rich guy who is really into Richard Hamilton's art. Just like I would be if there was an Owen James that made art. Everyone knows I am THE Owen James

22:41, 3 Jun - ‚Ä™+44 7545 989149‚Ä¨: Just an advert on the tube, making me sad about Oberyn...

23:17, 3 Jun - p tschismarov: Dave your cordial is next level tasty. Nice one.
23:19, 3 Jun - Slam: Agreed! We're chugging and appreciating the delicious taste of childhood
23:51, 3 Jun - Dave Mendez: Glad you like it peeps. Xx
09:12, 4 Jun - Mike: X men this eve?
09:14, 4 Jun - ‚Ä™+44 7502 048124‚Ä¨: Prob not. Looks silly and not in a good way
09:15, 4 Jun - Mike: So's your face
09:17, 4 Jun - ‚Ä™+44 7502 048124‚Ä¨: Good one.
09:18, 4 Jun - Dave Mendez: I hear it's meant to be pretty good.
09:20, 4 Jun - ‚Ä™+44 7502 048124‚Ä¨: Thanks! I'm happy with it.
09:22, 4 Jun - Mike: I thought you liked the last one Lorna?
09:22, 4 Jun - Angela: It's good! I saw it last week
09:22, 4 Jun - Angela: Better than the last one I thought
09:23, 4 Jun - Angela: But you have to have watched first class otherwise it will make no sense at all
09:32, 4 Jun - ‚Ä™+44 7502 048124‚Ä¨: The last one was alright, but I'm a bit over superhero movies now. There's been way too many.
10:20, 4 Jun - Marth: Epic analysis Mike. For info, Shaggy's nicknames also include: mr shag shag, shagshag, and shagaroo.
10:22, 4 Jun - Marth: And now to boost my mentions, popularity and verbose ratings: Martha Martha Martha Martha Martha Martha Martha Martha Martha Martha
10:54, 4 Jun - Mike: Lol shhh. Not making it public til Friday, can't rush these things!
14:49, 4 Jun - Mike: Soooo... who's on for film? Oliza, you still down?
14:53, 4 Jun - Alan Wright: Ag
14:53, 4 Jun - Alan Wright: .Oo
14:53, 4 Jun - Alan Wright: Omza
14:59, 4 Jun - Slam: Tribal, like it
14:59, 4 Jun - Slam: Can't make film though, got some sushi to eat and computer games to play
15:06, 4 Jun - Mike: Fair dos. If anyone wants to go lemme know before 4.30
15:51, 4 Jun - Owen James: I'm out sorry mike. I have an interview for a promotion on Friday and there is quite a bit of preparation I need to do.
15:54, 4 Jun - Slam: You going for that data analysis thing?
16:00, 4 Jun - Owen James: Yep.
16:01, 4 Jun - Owen James: I have to prepare an analysis for it. But the way some of the data is stored is in cell formatting. So I'm going to have to write a format checking VB macro. And VB is shit.
16:03, 4 Jun - Owen James: However I doubt any of the other candidates will go into this much detail so it should give me a boost.
16:03, 4 Jun - Slam: Cool, I love that stuff. Sure you need to get into vb? There's probably a work around in excel
16:03, 4 Jun - Slam: Yeah for sure!
16:04, 4 Jun - Owen James: Nope. Excel doesn't have a getBGColour function. So I'm writing an excel macro, but excel macros are in stupid VB
16:07, 4 Jun - Slam: How many colours? You can filter by colour, it's a bit too manual, but quicker to use that if it's only a couple
16:38, 4 Jun - Shaggy Crazy Horse: Vb is only marginally better than brainfuck in terms of readability, and infinitely worse in functionality
16:49, 4 Jun - Bongo: VisiblyBullshit
16:55, 4 Jun - Owen James: It has so much redundant stuff.
16:56, 4 Jun - Bongo: Drinks at Yager later if anyone's interested
16:56, 4 Jun - Owen James: And no sensible syntax.
16:56, 4 Jun - Owen James: Its fucking doing my head in
17:54, 4 Jun - Owen James: Ha! In your face visual basic I fucking won!! 

Godamn its annoying.

09:32, 6 Jun - p tschismarov: If the weather stays this fine we should go for park wine in the eve.

12:17, 6 Jun - ‚Ä™+44 7807 744465‚Ä¨: Did you urm do this whilst at work?
12:41, 6 Jun - Mike: Did a bit, kind of replaced reddit this week
13:20, 6 Jun - Bunn: A bird shat right on my arm as i cycled to work this morning
13:20, 6 Jun - Bunn: Bastard
13:35, 6 Jun - Mike: Fixed your bike?
13:40, 6 Jun - Teegan: Hey Friday lunchtime rabble, any fun plans for tonight?

14:40, 6 Jun - Marth: Damn I really want to park and wine right now.
14:40, 6 Jun - Marth: Whine
14:42, 6 Jun - p tschismarov: So where's a park that works for errbody?
14:47, 6 Jun - Mike: But Henry, then you'll be able to see how much shit we used to talk about you before you joined
14:50, 6 Jun - Mike: A park near to old St works for me
14:52, 6 Jun - Henry Franks: im surprised there was time in between all of bunns pictures
14:53, 6 Jun - Angela: I want to park and wine too! Instead I'm going to Birmingham for work :( I bet it's grey there too, it's practically in the north
16:00, 6 Jun - Shaggy Crazy Horse: I'm going to park near borough with work peeps
16:07, 6 Jun - Mike: Works for me, which one?
16:11, 6 Jun - Slam: ...awkward
16:20, 6 Jun - Teegan: What's awkward?

16:31, 6 Jun - Teegan: Ah
16:31, 6 Jun - Teegan: Just read that she can't leave the house.  Doh.
16:31, 6 Jun - Henry Franks: will do! shes going a little insane being stuck in so well be out when its healed!
16:32, 6 Jun - Henry Franks: ha yea! according to the physio even just having the weigjt of her arm while standing up is enough to exacerbate it...
16:32, 6 Jun - Teegan: Sounds nasty
16:39, 6 Jun - Bongo: How did she manage to fuck it up so bad?
16:39, 6 Jun - Henry Franks: she tried to do a single pullup...
16:49, 6 Jun - Shaggy Crazy Horse: Lol
16:49, 6 Jun - Shaggy Crazy Horse: I'm probably going to mint street park

01:01, 14 Jun - Dave Mendez: Hey you sexy creatures. I think we'll be moving the boat tomorrow from kings cross to trendy trendy east London. Of anyone wants to joins us for the cruise you are very welcome. Xx
01:01, 14 Jun - ‚Ä™+44 7502 048124‚Ä¨: ÓÑÖ
01:02, 14 Jun - ‚Ä™+44 7502 048124‚Ä¨: Yes. Probably.
09:02, 14 Jun - Bunn: Yep
09:36, 14 Jun - Henry Franks: where in east you headed?
09:44, 14 Jun - Wills: Can we drive?? Just for a bit?
10:04, 14 Jun - Bunn: Canning Town visitors. We will be showing all world cup matches today so come round whenever.
10:04, 14 Jun - Bunn: Jubilee line is shut from london bridge so get dlr
11:11, 14 Jun - Dave Mendez: Urrgh, just got up. I'll let y'all know what's happening with boat once the world makes sense again. Xx
11:13, 14 Jun - Angela: Was just reading an article about zombies when that flashed at the top of my screen so your urrgh had extreme zombie properties when I read it
11:13, 14 Jun - Slam: Hehe, how's that early start coming on? X
11:42, 14 Jun - Wills: Dave - it doesn't sound like you're in any fit state to drive... Worse, if Angela's suspicions are correct, you may be a zombie, and we all know that zombies shouldn't drive (they never check their mirrors)... Will you need Sam and I to come and navigate stellar eastwards for the day? We can buy sailor hats! X
11:44, 14 Jun - Angela: I can confirm dave's undead status (in my mind) - adam you'll have to hurry to save tegan before it's too late!
11:49, 14 Jun - Wills: I assume it's too late for poor young teegz! (@T: sorry hun!) Plus, with two undead aboard the boat, it strengthens the argument that Sam and I should drive (which, under other circumstances may otherwise be a relatively weak argument)
11:49, 14 Jun - Henry Franks: "may"
11:56, 14 Jun - Slam: I dig that you're doing the pre-apocalypse research Angie, when the time comes your house well be the first stop
12:04, 14 Jun - Dave Mendez: Tegan has pacified me with strawberries so no flesh eating this morning. I accept your argument Adam, if you fancy some cruising come on over.
12:05, 14 Jun - Dave Mendez: Henry, I'm not sure how far east we'll go. Perhaps only to angel but possibly to Hoxton.
12:06, 14 Jun - Dave Mendez: How're you doing Sam? You were at least as drunk as me last night.
12:08, 14 Jun - Wills: Yessss... My work is done. Am on my way!
12:54, 14 Jun - Slam: I woke up in a strange place staring right into the cold depths of shaggy's eyes
12:54, 14 Jun - Slam: The days picking up though

20:35, 14 Jun - Bunn: So who can we expect to join us for the match tonight?

16:57, 16 Jun - Angela: Twitter always knows...
16:57, 16 Jun - Owen James: I'm in Wallington. The train keeps stopping for 10 minutes at each station. Apparently there is congestion.
16:58, 16 Jun - Angela: https://twitter.com/redhilltravel/status/478564810553315329
17:05, 16 Jun - Owen James: Cheers Angela!

19:55, 16 Jun - ‚Ä™+44 7545 989149‚Ä¨: It's mid transformation. I'm pushing for a Castle Black theme, but Lyd has vetoed that.
19:56, 16 Jun - Vanessa "Beast" Matthews: I'm going to have to bail on this one
22:50, 16 Jun - Shaggy Crazy Horse: Doesn't that mean no women allowed? I can see why
10:07, 17 Jun - Dave Mendez: Who is up for Stonehenge this Friday? Plan is to get a train after work, party with the druids til sunrise, snooze under a tree by Salisbury cathedral then shimmy back on Saturday early afternoon.
10:08, 17 Jun - Dave Mendez: If we go as a group the train is just under ¬£30 return. Coach to the stones is ¬£5-10. Hugging the stones... Priceless.
10:15, 17 Jun - Vanessa "Beast" Matthews: I'm interested but my work finishes at 7pm and I need to be back for 11am work on Sat. I was thinking training it
10:17, 17 Jun - ‚Ä™+44 7807 744465‚Ä¨: And I'm gonna chip in here and say - big up those who are coming to tandem festival. The camp site opens at 5pm so my gang are looking to leave London around 3.30pm if y'all's wanna join! Bus or train? We can't decide. Other info: all food on site will be veggie and vegan so bring ham if you are that way inclined. Bring alcohol in plastic bottles/cans. No glass. No naked flames - but there will be a massive bonfire in the evenings for chillin.
10:18, 17 Jun - Angela: I would love to Dave but it's Jason's birthday on Friday and we have plans for the evening. What time are you gonna head down?
10:18, 17 Jun - ‚Ä™+44 7807 744465‚Ä¨: Got a spare ticket going for tandem fest cheap if anyone's up for it. Going for the Friday and Saturday eve, back Sunday morn/early noon. Scarlett band is on at 9pm xx
10:19, 17 Jun - Slam: That 5pm Friday Han? Me n Bongo were hoping to head down that morning to set up, possible? X
10:26, 17 Jun - ‚Ä™+44 7807 744465‚Ä¨: That 5pm Friday for camp site opening. So that morning a lil early
10:27, 17 Jun - ‚Ä™+44 7807 744465‚Ä¨: But I could ask my friend who runs it anyway - let me get back to you
10:27, 17 Jun - Owen James: Sorry dave and hannah me and Eliza are in Brighton this weekend.
10:28, 17 Jun - Slam: No worries, thought there might be stuff going on that day, if not we'll had for 5 instead
10:38, 17 Jun - Dave Mendez: @V - those times could work, though getting back for 11 would mean leaving Salisbury at around 9 which is certainly possible. Is there any chance you can start a little later?
10:39, 17 Jun - Vanessa "Beast" Matthews: Unfortunately no :( I can head back on my own, but not sure what that would mean for the group tickets
10:42, 17 Jun - Dave Mendez: Good point. I don't mind heading back early, I've snoozed in Salisbury plenty.
10:43, 17 Jun - Dave Mendez: @ Angie: heading down sometime after 7 on Friday.
12:44, 17 Jun - Kritzia: hellooo!!! So today is Mex vs Brazil match! It's going to be amaziing and loud!!

12:55, 17 Jun - Bunn: Go Brazil!!!
12:57, 17 Jun - Kritzia: Baby there's a chance that you won't be able to get in!! If that happens just try the other door ;)

13:23, 17 Jun - Bongo: Haha sure ;), sounds good though, I'll probably head over after work to get there for 7ish
13:25, 17 Jun - ‚Ä™+44 7807 744465‚Ä¨: News just in for tandem festival - you can arrive earlier than 5 but you may well get roped into helping to set things up (putting up poles and the like).
13:29, 17 Jun - Kritzia: Coool!! the place is tiny there's a bar & a restaurant... Go to the bar I'll be around screaming my lungs out!! Just follow the noice ;)
13:34, 17 Jun - Mike: If Brazil came second in their group that would be a lot better for us...

19:41, 17 Jun - Bunn: Are you just outside the door?
19:43, 17 Jun - Slam: Yeah! Which part are you in?
19:44, 17 Jun - Bunn: In the upstairs part. They say they'll let more people in when the queue for tacos dies down
19:44, 17 Jun - Bunn: And disperses a bit more
19:44, 17 Jun - Vanessa "Beast" Matthews: Is there any point of me coming if it's already full?
19:45, 17 Jun - Bunn: Depends if being surrounded by mexicans is your thing
19:48, 17 Jun - Slam: Yeah! They're letting people in, just real slow
19:48, 17 Jun - Slam: If you can't get in, we'll go somewhere else x

10:16, 6 Jul - ‚Ä™+44 7502 048124‚Ä¨: Costa Rica have a player called Johnny a Costa. I think he made it up to sound Costa Rican
10:16, 6 Jul - Shaggy Crazy Horse: He was really a Dutch player sabotaging Costa Rica from the inside

15:55, 7 Jul - Mike: There were two that were so far out in front it was silly. Then an insane stampede about a minute later
15:56, 7 Jul - Mike: There were lots of jeeps going past blaring out French commentary
15:57, 7 Jul - Mike: The weirdest thing was how color coordinated it all looked, it was like the Warriors or something
15:59, 7 Jul - Shaggy Crazy Horse: Those two at the front were being chased by the rest
16:22, 7 Jul - Angela: I saw it last year - they all cycle crazy close together at insane speed.
16:31, 7 Jul - Mike: Yeah its nuts. I think 90% of the riders went past me in one 2 second interval
16:39, 7 Jul - Vanessa "Beast" Matthews: It's best to watch in Paris because at least you get to see the tops of their helmets a few times when they repeat the circuit
16:40, 7 Jul - Bunn: I have decided that the sensation of being a spectator at the TdF is not to watch the cycling
16:41, 7 Jul - Bunn: But to witness the speed they go at
16:41, 7 Jul - Angela: Definitely agree!
16:42, 7 Jul - Angela: And to imagine what would happen if two crashed - it'd be the worlds most spectacular dominoes

11:36, 8 Jul - Teegan: Yeah
12:53, 8 Jul - Slam: Game on! I've got to head home and pack first, if anyone could get there a bit early and exist in a space, I'll be there for 9
12:56, 8 Jul - Teegan: What a thing to ask! I hate existing in space.
13:01, 8 Jul - Slam: But you do it with such aplomb, a true blue natural exister
13:01, 8 Jul - Shaggy Crazy Horse: I can be there in time but not space
13:17, 8 Jul - Teegan: Which makes you conceptually very interesting, but terrible company
13:39, 8 Jul - ‚Ä™+44 7807 744465‚Ä¨: Hear hear
13:59, 8 Jul - p tschismarov: Dang, this was my time to shine. Existing is what I do best.
18:10, 8 Jul - Teegan: What time are people who exist in both space and time likely to show up, given that they're not in Brussels?
18:18, 8 Jul - Mike: I'm in Euston now, heading over to Old St
18:21, 8 Jul - Slam: Home, pack, over, 8.30 for me x
18:23, 8 Jul - Bunn: Its a bit hard to find. But its round the corner from kick bar. Under the railway bridges. The door in the wall is fat ronaldos
18:23, 8 Jul - Bunn: Not obvious cos its a popup
18:23, 8 Jul - Bunn: But they've put up posters with arrows on
18:25, 8 Jul - Shaggy Crazy Horse: It's pretty hard to miss

21:35, 8 Jul - Shaggy Crazy Horse: 6-5 to Brazil
21:35, 8 Jul - Slam: 6-5 Brazil, last one in added time
21:38, 8 Jul - Slam: Brazil play best on the back foot, they've got Germany right where they want them
21:42, 8 Jul - Mike: Germany just sliced off Brazil's back foot, then used it to score a goal against them

21:56, 8 Jul - Slam: Huzzah!
21:56, 8 Jul - Slam: Byob

22:51, 8 Jul - Mike: 7-1 called it! It was obvious... Science!
22:51, 8 Jul - Shaggy Crazy Horse: Lol nice
22:51, 8 Jul - Shaggy Crazy Horse: You play the lottery

21:55, 11 Jul - Angela: My work put on a lecture today with my dissertation tutor! Also nostalgic!
22:00, 11 Jul - Dave Mendez: Where did those years go. I feel a powerful urge to go off on an adventure.
22:00, 11 Jul - Dave Mendez: Perhaps I've had too much M&S 'French lager'.
22:01, 11 Jul - Dave Mendez: Which seems like a cultural oxymoron
22:01, 11 Jul - Angela: Haha
22:01, 11 Jul - Angela: I loves me an M&S gin-Tim

10:42, 13 Jul - Owen James: So whats everyone doing for the world cup tonight?
10:42, 13 Jul - ‚Ä™+44 7830 332317‚Ä¨: Crying?
10:45, 13 Jul - ‚Ä™+44 7830 332317‚Ä¨: <Media omitted>
10:48, 13 Jul - Owen James: Haha! I got Germany in the draw so was pretty pleased with that win.
10:57, 13 Jul - ‚Ä™+44 7502 048124‚Ä¨: I've got Argentina in a sweep stake!
11:01, 13 Jul - Owen James: You and me lorna outside now! Oxford rules! First blood wins!
12:53, 13 Jul - Teegan: What area people's plans for the game?
13:22, 13 Jul - Owen James: I was going to do what everyone else was doing!
13:22, 13 Jul - Owen James: It would be good to find a german or argentinian pub
13:23, 13 Jul - Owen James: I think German is more likely
14:07, 13 Jul - ‚Ä™+44 7502 048124‚Ä¨: How was that hackney venue with the mega screen?
14:08, 13 Jul - ‚Ä™+44 7502 048124‚Ä¨: Though its great weather for a BBQ...
14:25, 13 Jul - Teegan: Hackney venue was pretty chilled last time, might be more happening for the final
14:25, 13 Jul - Teegan: They also had a terrible beer selection
14:25, 13 Jul - Teegan: Massive screen though
14:37, 13 Jul - Bongo: I'm not too fussed tbh, I didn't want to see either of these teams play
14:37, 13 Jul - Bunn: Come to ours!
14:37, 13 Jul - Bunn: Cant be arsed to go out to watch the final
14:38, 13 Jul - Bunn: Have so little enthusiasm for germany or argentina
14:39, 13 Jul - Teegan: I think it's unlikely to be a stunning game, given the standard of football so far
14:57, 13 Jul - Owen James: I think Germany have the potential to make something exciting happen. Like 7-1
15:07, 13 Jul - ‚Ä™+44 7502 048124‚Ä¨: Yeah, like 7-1 to Argentina! Ha, smack talk.
15:16, 13 Jul - Owen James: I don't get why people dont think this will be a good game. It is by definition the two best teams in the world!
16:03, 13 Jul - Bunn: I guess you didnt watch the last 2 world cups finals
16:04, 13 Jul - Bunn: Best remembered for Zidane's headbutt, De Jong's flying kick on Alonso. And Van Basten hacking all the Spaniards to pieces
16:05, 13 Jul - Bunn: Could be a good match if they actually play
16:43, 13 Jul - Teegan: The Germans don't play dirty.  And Messi doesn't dive...
17:00, 13 Jul - Owen James: So whats going on tonight then. Are we watching in canning town.
17:03, 13 Jul - Teegan: Sounds right to me
17:03, 13 Jul - Teegan: Are y'all in now? I'm bored of cleaning
17:11, 13 Jul - Owen James: Me and lizard will be there 7ish.
17:21, 13 Jul - ‚Ä™+44 7502 048124‚Ä¨: I'm up for watching it in Canning Town.
18:06, 13 Jul - Mike: Not true, you can't compare Germany and Holland if Germany lose...
18:35, 13 Jul - ‚Ä™+44 7502 048124‚Ä¨: So are people going to c town then? I'll head there now if so.
18:41, 13 Jul - Teegan: O and E are on their way
18:41, 13 Jul - Teegan: I'm still deliberating whether to wait for Dave to get home
18:42, 13 Jul - Teegan: Anyone planning to fire up the barbie?

19:23, 17 Jul - p tschismarov: And if I was shadow minister I would criticise you for not making them backward roll as well.
19:57, 17 Jul - Bongo: And if I were lord speaker, I'd force you both to compete in a forward roll competition
19:58, 17 Jul - Dave Mendez: All of this must, of course, see royal assent and I do believe that the queen is partial to seeing all of parliament forward roll.

10:30, 20 Jul - Angela: Lovely jubbly. Do you have plans for the afternoon/early eve? Currently got the post-holiday lazies so heading out seems much more appealing than unpacking

12:37, 4 Aug - p tschismarov: Eat it before it turns the neighbouring plants red. Domino effect is a Bitch.
20:20, 4 Aug - Bunn: <Media omitted>
20:46, 5 Aug - Slam: Anyone watching the debate? I need to educate myself!
20:51, 5 Aug - Teegan: Can you record it? Does that still happen?
20:51, 5 Aug - Angela: What debate is this?
20:52, 5 Aug - Teegan: Or could iplayer it later in the week?  Would be happy to join you to yaahboo at Alex Salmond
20:52, 5 Aug - Dave Mendez: The summary is that salmond will say lots of optimistic things and darling will say lots of pessimistic things (despite his name).
20:52, 5 Aug - Dave Mendez: It will be unclear who is right
20:53, 5 Aug - Dave Mendez: End result will depend on whether you are optimistic or not
12:35, 6 Aug - Slam: Good debate, felt a lot more like opinions backed by facts, and less like rabble rousing rhetoric than I was expecting
12:35, 6 Aug - Slam: Just saw this a week, guess who made their own outfit from a bin bag
12:35, 6 Aug - Slam: <Media omitted>

10:22, 8 Aug - Shaggy Crazy Horse: Óêí that's so awesome
10:24, 8 Aug - Bunn: Lol
10:42, 8 Aug - Teegan: Yaaaay!
10:43, 8 Aug - Angela: He's dead now.
10:48, 8 Aug - Shaggy Crazy Horse: Because you ate him?
11:00, 8 Aug - Angela: Yeah, poor little guy didn't stand a chance
11:01, 8 Aug - Angela: Far too tasty looking
11:19, 8 Aug - Bunn: Thats what gets for being sad/happy on a friday
11:33, 8 Aug - Kritzia: Hahahaha happyyy üéäüéäÓåíÓåí Friday!!!
11:33, 8 Aug - Kritzia: I don't want to get eaten ;)
14:45, 8 Aug - Shaggy Crazy Horse: Someone died from e cigarette exploding, they are bound to make them illegal now
14:46, 8 Aug - Henry Franks: laaame I love my ecig
14:46, 8 Aug - Teegan: A few people have set on fire already
14:47, 8 Aug - Teegan: I imagine it will be hard to stop people ordering them from China,  which is where they all seem to come from anyway
14:47, 8 Aug - Henry Franks: tbh mine gets really sodding hot im not surprised theyre combusting
14:48, 8 Aug - Angela: Technically he was killed by his oxygen tank exploding
14:48, 8 Aug - Angela: Set off by the eecigarette
14:48, 8 Aug - Teegan: Was he under water?
14:48, 8 Aug - Angela: So you're probably ok unless you're carting one of those around, in which case you're not that ok to begin with
14:48, 8 Aug - Shaggy Crazy Horse: That's circumstantial, e cigarettes are the real #terrorists here
14:49, 8 Aug - Angela: I'm guessing he had some kind of smoking related illness - how ironic
14:50, 8 Aug - Shaggy Crazy Horse: To have lung cancer and die from explosion?
14:50, 8 Aug - Shaggy Crazy Horse: At least he can laugh in the face of cancer
14:51, 8 Aug - Henry Franks: id rather die explosively than cancerously tbh
14:51, 8 Aug - Shaggy Crazy Horse: That's ambiguous. Explosive diarrhoea is not a nice way to go
14:53, 8 Aug - Henry Franks: depends just how explosive surely. I mean, if your digestive system straight up vaporises you it wouldnt be too bad
14:53, 8 Aug - Angela: It'd be bad for whoever finds you
14:54, 8 Aug - Angela: Vaporised by poo
15:16, 8 Aug - Teegan: Ye gods
15:16, 8 Aug - Teegan: Is it possible?
15:46, 8 Aug - Shaggy Crazy Horse: Yup, lookup pooverization
15:47, 8 Aug - Shaggy Crazy Horse: In fact this is where the word poverty is desired from, literally meaning bathing in own shit
15:49, 8 Aug - Henry Franks: haha pooverisation love it
15:49, 8 Aug - Henry Franks: not to be confused with hooverisation, wherein the victim is slowly pulled inside a dyson
15:55, 8 Aug - Shaggy Crazy Horse: If anyone is interested in etymology, the term was invented by dyson on Hoover dam, and has nothing to do with hoovers, which are not powerful enough for that particular form of homicide
15:55, 8 Aug - Teegan: Or shoeverisation, where the victim is beaten to death with his own shoes...
15:55, 8 Aug - Teegan: Good Fridaying, everyone x
16:03, 8 Aug - Bunn: I just misprinted 80 sheets of paper
16:03, 8 Aug - Mike: Lol
16:03, 8 Aug - Mike: Poo
16:03, 8 Aug - Bunn: Time for te pub methinks

16:36, 19 Aug - Teegan: Tee hee hee
16:46, 19 Aug - Shaggy Crazy Horse: BillY Wang

19:32, 19 Aug - Owen James: I teach a kid called dong hung. I bet he doesn't get picked on because he can always use the "dong hung by name dong hung by nature" comeback.

18:49, 1 Sep - Shaggy Crazy Horse: If you like turkish cuisine I strongly recommend tas, it's pretty cheap and mighty tasty. If you want tapas then brindisa is really good, it's moderately priced. If you want a more pub-like atmosphere the George has excellent chefs too
19:41, 1 Sep - Lora Staffenschloten: Brindisa is expensive and always too crowded, long wait. I always love me a good vapiano!
22:58, 1 Sep - Bongo: I thought you said it was Friday henners, or is that something else

20:40, 5 Sep - Owen James: I believe bongo was relaying the information that a fine gangsta named shorty is able to fire a shot gun proficiently but only if he is in less affluent neighbourhoods.
20:41, 5 Sep - ‚Ä™+44 7545 989149‚Ä¨: (After the 'incident')

I live in a forest
Eating bugs makes my day
Detroit what'd ya say?
21:26, 5 Sep - Owen James: I pull out my gat
And with a ratatat tat
Five slugs in your belly
Makes tupac jelly.
21:30, 5 Sep - Owen James: When I left compton town
The crime rate went down
Like sam's mom on peter kay
Thats g life; O-K?
21:30, 5 Sep - Shaggy Crazy Horse: Not bad
21:31, 5 Sep - Shaggy Crazy Horse: For a five year old dive dwelling chive favouring slum child

21:32, 5 Sep - Teegan: Nice rhymes, o
21:33, 5 Sep - Teegan: Where did V go?
21:37, 5 Sep - Owen James: Let's have a word for Mike swarbrick.
He wears the badge of a law dick.
Takes names: 'your nicked'
His mom takes the dicks of four tricks!
21:39, 5 Sep - Teegan: Niiiiiice intro
21:48, 5 Sep - Owen James: Whatup tegan palmer
Voice like a farmer.
Herder of llama.
Wearer of armour.

Yeah I know, that's not so good.
But it ain't bad for a guy from the hood.
I'll stop and continue you should.
While I pause and eat my pud.
21:52, 5 Sep - ‚Ä™+44 7545 989149‚Ä¨: O, your rhymes are so reckless,
We'll show you up as a ludicrous,
feckless, slow loris.
Less ability than Boris...
Johnson at rapping,
caught you napping, prattling
about other's mothers,
but yours ain't getting no thinner,
Time to shut up and eat your dinner.
21:53, 5 Sep - Shaggy Crazy Horse: I like your rhymes but they're not quite mature, think for a bit and then when you're sure hit back, with rhyme that ain't whack, rhyme that will make me take smack, rhyme that will me take crack, crack my back, whack the smack and all that, sure
21:53, 5 Sep - Owen James: Reckless and ludicrous rhyme in no way at all.

Other than that.  It was pretty good.
21:55, 5 Sep - Shaggy Crazy Horse: Dan your rhymes rule, you've studied the school of cool, they literally make drool. You ain't no fool! Like poor O
22:04, 5 Sep - ‚Ä™+44 7545 989149‚Ä¨: I don't need no rhyming dictionary using critic,
The links and perfect timing, work when I just hit it.
If you read the flow like my man Shaggage
You'll find no space for baggage:
Ludicrous, said like the rapper, entrepreneur and actor
rhymes with reckless and is a determining factor,
In your freestyling downfall,
Your mind is so small,
I await your next reply, so
Alex Trofymenko,
Can just show
How its done yo.
22:04, 5 Sep - ‚Ä™+44 7545 989149‚Ä¨: Or alternatively teegz

12:44, 6 Sep - Mike: Ah downer

12:57, 12 Sep - Mike: TIL: George Foreman has 5 sons called George, George, George, George and George
12:57, 12 Sep - Mike: And a daughter called Georgetta
13:00, 12 Sep - Slam: That's nuts
13:00, 12 Sep - Slam: And a great Wikipedia read
13:01, 12 Sep - Joe Jarman: Must get confusing at Christmas
13:01, 12 Sep - Joe Jarman: Do they have nicknames
13:02, 12 Sep - Joe Jarman: I bet he just gets them all an updated version of his grill anyway

13:12, 12 Sep - Mike: I like that he turned down Georgia, Georgie, Georgina for Georgetta!
13:12, 12 Sep - Mike: Probly cause they don't keep the George intact
13:13, 12 Sep - Teegan: Roman numerals are always a stately option
13:13, 12 Sep - Slam: Think it's a cultural thing?, or he just really really loves himself?
13:14, 12 Sep - Slam: <Media omitted>

13:16, 12 Sep - Mike: What with the marbles he lost boxing
13:34, 12 Sep - Angela: Maybe he's just passing on his greatest legacy. The name of an amazing piece of kitchenware. Being called george Forman must open a lot of doors in life
13:35, 12 Sep - Mike: His sons should change the name to George Fiveman
13:43, 12 Sep - Slam: Would you rather fight one George Fiveman sized George Foreman, or four George Foreman sized George Fivemans?
13:44, 12 Sep - Mike: That's a question philosophers will be asking for many years to come I imagine Sam

14:18, 12 Sep - p tschismarov: Why is this happening?
14:31, 12 Sep - ‚Ä™+44 7807 744465‚Ä¨: When you start to write names in fb, it tries to auto-tag
14:32, 12 Sep - Joe Jarman: Does grandmaster flash have to be a page they've liked?
14:33, 12 Sep - ‚Ä™+44 7807 744465‚Ä¨: Nah it's just started making any old suggestions closest to what you're writing
14:33, 12 Sep - ‚Ä™+44 7807 744465‚Ä¨: Or perhaps old nana's just love the flashster

19:24, 13 Sep - Teegan: Wellcome is sweet, the exhibition is small, but the permanent exhibition is also worth a look
19:25, 13 Sep - Teegan: In the vacinity of the cider tap aswell, which is a home away from home for a West Country man

20:15, 13 Sep - Teegan: Eric Cantona. 1987
21:46, 13 Sep - Angela: Rocking a Burberry hat too, years ahead of the curve

10:01, 14 Sep - Vanessa "Beast" Matthews: Sorry guys brunch is postponed today
10:33, 14 Sep - Bongo: Lol that looks tasty
10:47, 14 Sep - Adamina Carden: At 6:30 it was amazeballs
10:57, 14 Sep - Teegan: Mmmmm
10:58, 14 Sep - Teegan: Shall we do something else instead of brunch?
11:01, 14 Sep - Joe Jarman: Fry up
14:09, 14 Sep - Teegan: The time for fry ups may have passed
14:09, 14 Sep - Teegan: But if anyone fancies coming round for a beer and a board game you'd be more than welcome
14:32, 14 Sep - Teegan: Or out for a roast later?
14:32, 14 Sep - Teegan: Options
14:34, 14 Sep - Joe Jarman: Flint knapping in stoke Newington is an option
14:52, 14 Sep - ‚Ä™+44 7502 048124‚Ä¨: I was going to head to the old blue last later on, for some jazzy live music. Its free, and round the corner (from me at least)
14:57, 14 Sep - Teegan: Both sound intriguing
14:57, 14 Sep - Teegan: Will you be stripping out the copper as well, Joe?
16:54, 14 Sep - Teegan: (Have since looked up what flint knapping is- looks like fun)
18:24, 14 Sep - Joe Jarman: I know I'm gutted I didn't attend
15:49, 15 Sep - Bunn: <Media omitted>
15:49, 15 Sep - Bunn: <Media omitted>
16:32, 15 Sep - Teegan: Where's the second one from?
16:35, 15 Sep - Bunn: Google extrafabulouscomics

16:55, 15 Sep - Bunn: Yeah back around 6.30ish
16:55, 15 Sep - Bunn: Bring wine
16:55, 15 Sep - Adamina Carden: It's meat-free Monday so if it's a veggie pie then yes
16:56, 15 Sep - Adamina Carden: I got y'all a postcard. Here's a sneak peek
16:56, 15 Sep - Bunn: Afraid it has several types of meat
16:57, 15 Sep - Adamina Carden: <Media omitted>

20:18, 16 Sep - Slam: Even better! He's in the green division, guaranteed promotion
20:28, 16 Sep - Dave Mendez: Don't forget his hats...he hates that they're not all green
20:32, 16 Sep - Adamina Carden: Oh, and his undies
20:33, 16 Sep - Dave Mendez: You always have to turn a serious conversation into something silly don't you...
20:36, 16 Sep - Adamina Carden: I am dead serious. If Bunn doesn't have all green undies then he's not a real man
20:37, 16 Sep - Dave Mendez: Well as long as you're serious! Shame you don't have yellow dye, could get a teenage mutant teenage turtle theme going
20:38, 16 Sep - Mike: Wait, do you mean this?
20:38, 16 Sep - Mike: <Media omitted>

13:52, 17 Sep - Slam: Good comparative religion Bunn
13:53, 17 Sep - Bunn: I remember holi was just after we left india in feb

14:16, 17 Sep - Kritzia: and then she could meet all you beautiful people from the other side of the world ÓÑÜ
15:31, 17 Sep - Slam: Veto, sounds too loud
15:46, 17 Sep - Bongo: Lol
15:47, 17 Sep - Bongo: I'm up for loud Mexican times
15:47, 17 Sep - Bongo: Also up for the colour run
15:48, 17 Sep - Kritzia: She is gorgeous!!! to not say one of the most beautiful people I know! !
15:49, 17 Sep - Kritzia: She is a musical actress so super fun to be around
15:50, 17 Sep - Owen James: Well I don't know  about anyone else but that was a  good sell. I'm in. Let  us all gaze upon this beauty.
15:58, 17 Sep - Kritzia: Hehe he well I'm just saying we should do something fun :)
16:08, 17 Sep - Adamina Carden: ÓÄé

18:58, 17 Sep - Bongo: I might have to take a bus
19:01, 17 Sep - Bunn: Hmm
19:01, 17 Sep - Bunn: Might bail then
19:01, 17 Sep - Bunn: Only wanted a quick one
19:02, 17 Sep - Teegan: Won't be long
19:02, 17 Sep - Teegan: I've had enough of this
19:05, 17 Sep - Bongo: Eta tegs?
19:05, 17 Sep - Bongo: Google says I'll be 15 mins
19:09, 17 Sep - Bunn: Bleh üò©üò§
19:10, 17 Sep - Bongo: Go home then part timer =P
19:11, 17 Sep - Bunn: This guy was bored and finished at 6
19:13, 17 Sep - Bongo: Lol I won't blame you if you leave, I'd rather be water boarded than bored
19:15, 17 Sep - Teegan: 13 minute walk from here
19:26, 17 Sep - Bongo: Just got here if anyone's around
19:27, 17 Sep - Bongo: The pints are on me
19:27, 17 Sep - Bongo: Just like an alcoholic milkybar kid
19:32, 17 Sep - Teegan: I'm outside Bong- let's enjoy this mild evening
19:48, 17 Sep - Bunn: Yeah i went home
19:56, 17 Sep - Slam: Just tubing from Euston, the anchor still aye?
20:21, 17 Sep - Bongo: Aye
22:27, 17 Sep - Teegan: Owen owen owen, what was the pretty building game for phones you talked about, with the building interaction and such?
22:39, 17 Sep - Owen James: ?
22:39, 17 Sep - Teegan: I need a game
22:39, 17 Sep - Teegan: You mentioned you were playing one
22:40, 17 Sep - Teegan: A building game
22:40, 17 Sep - Teegan: Where rabbits interact work blueberries and the like
22:40, 17 Sep - Owen James: Terrestial?
22:40, 17 Sep - Owen James: Ohhhh
22:40, 17 Sep - Owen James: That's not a phone game
22:40, 17 Sep - Owen James: Reus.
22:40, 17 Sep - Teegan: Bum
22:40, 17 Sep - Owen James: It's really good.
22:40, 17 Sep - Teegan: I only need a phone game
22:41, 17 Sep - Owen James: I am learning android to make a phone game with similar ideas.
22:41, 17 Sep - Owen James: What kind of phone game?
22:43, 17 Sep - Teegan: A building game
22:43, 17 Sep - Teegan: With pretty
22:43, 17 Sep - Teegan: All crowd sourced suggestions welcome
22:48, 17 Sep - Slam: Terraria. Best game ever
23:09, 17 Sep - Owen James: There aren't  many good phone  building  games.
23:10, 17 Sep - Slam: Ooh xconstructor
23:10, 17 Sep - Owen James: Tiny tower was pretty addictive but it was one of those stupid wait  4 hours for something to  finish.
23:10, 17 Sep - Slam: Not sure if it's on iPhone, but it's awesome
23:10, 17 Sep - Owen James: X constructor?
23:10, 17 Sep - Owen James: That sounds good. What is it?
23:10, 17 Sep - Slam: I think that's it, where you build railway bridges and trains go over them
23:11, 17 Sep - Slam: But if you build them badly, everyone dies
23:18, 17 Sep - Owen James: Nice
23:34, 17 Sep - Joe Jarman: Hey Owen how good with android are you
23:34, 17 Sep - Joe Jarman: I'm starting a coursesa course in a few days
23:35, 17 Sep - Joe Jarman: Looking for others interested
23:35, 17 Sep - Joe Jarman: Also I've been messing about with unity as well
00:24, 18 Sep - Owen James: I'm about 1/4 of the way through my book. I have got the basics and am now using fragments. It's a pretty neat setup. Very scalable, but that means that you have to do quite a lot for even the simplest app. Fortunately android released a development  kit pre bundled with eclipse which takes away loads of the legwork  that existed when android was first  released. I haven't  looked into unity, mainly because I don't have an apple. What's  it like?
09:01, 18 Sep - Mike: What's the predictions for Scotland vote then?
09:02, 18 Sep - Angela: I think it'll be a no, what do you think?
09:02, 18 Sep - Mike: I reckon no too, morbidly curious to see a yes vote though...
09:02, 18 Sep - Angela: I didn't think I was bothered but actually I would be a bit sad if they voted yes
09:03, 18 Sep - Angela: Like being dumped by someone I completely took for granted all these years
09:03, 18 Sep - Mike: Lol
09:03, 18 Sep - Mike: And all those cyclists. Damn
09:05, 18 Sep - Mike: 55% no, that's my bet
09:06, 18 Sep - Slam: Cyclists?
09:06, 18 Sep - Marth: Reckon 52% no - a bit too close for comfort
09:06, 18 Sep - Slam: I'm not sure I care about the really. The important thing is it sets the stage for Cornish independence, which is way overdue
09:07, 18 Sep - Slam: *result
09:07, 18 Sep - Slam: They actually have their own currency, take that Scotland
09:08, 18 Sep - Mike: Yeah think about all those gold medals we got in the cycling!
09:09, 18 Sep - Mike: I reckon no's are underreporting. I'd be surprised by a yes vote
09:13, 18 Sep - Angela: I agree, I think 55% at least for no
09:18, 18 Sep - Dave Mendez: I think I would be happy either way: excited for an independent Scotland, content to see an island united.
09:20, 18 Sep - Dave Mendez: The underreporting point is true though the polls may not be very reliable. There was a chap from yougov on the radio the other day saying that polls are usually weighted to control for the way they are sampled however this process requires historical data
09:20, 18 Sep - Mike: There's no exit polls! Bullshit, where's the fun in that?
09:20, 18 Sep - Dave Mendez: There isn't any such data for this referendum but the weighting process has been done anyway which can skew the results
09:24, 18 Sep - Joe Jarman: Ungrateful Scots costing us a fortune yes or no, best just to cull the lot of em. Off to collect my dole money ÓêÖ
09:25, 18 Sep - Mike: You know betfair have already paid out on no? Thats pretty cocky...
09:26, 18 Sep - Angela: While they weight the results for sampling, they can't weight them for people lying. All the polls in 1992 predicted a labour win but it turned out that voting conservative was so uncool that people just didn't want to admit to it
09:26, 18 Sep - Dave Mendez: What happens if it's yes? Do they have to return the money?
09:27, 18 Sep - Angela: Probably voting no is seen as boring but actually people do want the safer option?
09:28, 18 Sep - Bunn: I'm for a yes vote
09:28, 18 Sep - Dave Mendez: Maybe, bit I wonder how many people, when in the ballot box, will let the excitement take over and change to yes
09:28, 18 Sep - Bunn: I bet they could have a more progressive country if they cut London loose
09:31, 18 Sep - Bunn: Great Britain is renamed, not-so-great-anymore Britain
09:32, 18 Sep - Kritzia: I think the contrary actually happens in the ballot box a lot of people take the safe option or they change right there!
09:32, 18 Sep - Bunn: Not-as-united as before Kindom
09:33, 18 Sep - Kritzia: I can't wait for this to be over! !! its boring at work all is Scott here there! ! Common
09:43, 18 Sep - Slam: They'll all be deported tomorrow, it'll be a lonely Friday for you!
09:49, 18 Sep - Kritzia: Hehe well if I had a vote I would say yes!!! Let's start a revolution just for the sake of it!!
09:54, 18 Sep - Bunn: Thats the spirit!
09:56, 18 Sep - Dave Mendez: Yay!
09:57, 18 Sep - Adamina Carden: If the Scots leave then soon enough we'll have Wales and the rest of Ireland jumping ship too
09:57, 18 Sep - Adamina Carden: Then well just be "Britain"
09:57, 18 Sep - Bunn: Wales and Ireland dont have any oil
09:59, 18 Sep - Bunn: But i would quite like to see Wales go it alone
09:59, 18 Sep - Bunn: They could export loveliness
10:05, 18 Sep - Mike: Let's have a London referendum! Fuck everyone else!
10:05, 18 Sep - Mike: Except Hatfield
10:07, 18 Sep - Owen James: I hope it is a yes. That would be an awesome experiment.
10:08, 18 Sep - Owen James: One that we can observe but that really doesn't  affect us much.
10:08, 18 Sep - Slam: Whisky prices will go up
10:08, 18 Sep - Slam: It's the only effect on my life I can think of
10:11, 18 Sep - Mike: Gold medals in cycling will plummet
10:11, 18 Sep - Vanessa "Beast" Matthews: England is starting to produce some good whiskey
10:11, 18 Sep - Mike: People keep ignoring the big issues
10:12, 18 Sep - Mike: Do we still get to claim someone from the uk won Wimbledon?
10:12, 18 Sep - Owen James: Will they? That depends on  a lot of factors: Import  and export tax between England and Scotland, whether the new scoring government  decides to subsidise whiskey, EU trade rules.
10:14, 18 Sep - Slam: It won't go down
10:14, 18 Sep - Mike: It also depends on whether we decide to put Hadrian's wall back up
10:14, 18 Sep - Slam: We're only losing Hoy, and without the superior british bikes and training, he'll dwindle to a hollowed has been
10:21, 18 Sep - Bunn: He'll dwindle to a hollowed has been anyway
10:21, 18 Sep - Bunn: Ha!
10:21, 18 Sep - Bunn: Ageing
10:22, 18 Sep - Bunn: I think claiming Andy Murray as our own has been a gigantic push for Scottish independence
10:24, 18 Sep - Owen James: It could go down sam. It is a big industry. Wouldn't be suprised if a Scotland in charge of thier own economy decide to subsidise it loads. That coupled with EU trade laws would mean no export tax to Britain.
10:25, 18 Sep - Owen James: France subsidise thier wine industry considerably.

10:18, 25 Sep - Adamina Carden: Hey c-towners. Where is this cheap racist hairdresser I can go to for a short back and sides
10:19, 25 Sep - Shaggy Crazy Horse: I think you should grow a mullet
10:23, 25 Sep - Adamina Carden: That is an option...
10:49, 25 Sep - Mike: Peter's. He may also be sexist in which case you'll have to pretend to be a guy
10:50, 25 Sep - Mike: He's really crap btw, I just go there out of habit now
10:54, 25 Sep - Adamina Carden: Haha... I do look a bit like a boy
10:54, 25 Sep - Adamina Carden: How can you mess up short back and sides though?
10:56, 25 Sep - Owen James: By doing long back and sides instead.
10:56, 25 Sep - Owen James: Like a monk.
11:01, 25 Sep - Mike: One time he forgot to cut one of the sides, and I had to remind him
11:03, 25 Sep - Adamina Carden: Hahaha

11:39, 25 Sep - Vanessa "Beast" Matthews: Now you can call for an ambulance
11:40, 25 Sep - Owen James: Instructions unclear. Now he has an ambulance stuck under his kneecap.
11:45, 25 Sep - Shaggy Crazy Horse: Get off your phone and help the damn kid
11:45, 25 Sep - Owen James: Instructions unclear. Now my phone is duct taped to his forehead!
12:43, 25 Sep - Bongo: Skirt size linked to breast cancer?!
12:44, 25 Sep - Bongo: I've seriously had enough of bbc news
12:48, 25 Sep - Owen James: Wait shorter or longer?
12:49, 25 Sep - Owen James: Shorter skirt size linked to breast cancer - Christian union says.
Long skirt size linked to breast cancer playboy magazine says.
12:49, 25 Sep - Owen James: One might begin to question thier motivations.
12:50, 25 Sep - Teegan: Ha
12:50, 25 Sep - Owen James: Also if it's long skirts that cause breast cancer does that mean we can stop victim blaming when a woman in a short skirt gets raped because she was just trying to protect herself from cancer.
12:51, 25 Sep - Teegan: I think they mean skirt size causes cancer.
12:55, 25 Sep - Owen James: It's like the people who do these studies have never heard of comorbidity.
12:55, 25 Sep - Angela: So if I wear jeans? No cancer?
12:55, 25 Sep - Teegan: Solved!
12:55, 25 Sep - Angela: Wait... Jean skirts though
12:56, 25 Sep - Angela: No jean skirts
12:56, 25 Sep - Dave Mendez: Which way round is the correlation? Should I wear skirts?
12:57, 25 Sep - Teegan: Perhaps you should do a pamphlet
12:57, 25 Sep - Teegan: But not wearing skirts doesn't stop you have a skirt size
12:57, 25 Sep - Teegan: So yes dave
12:57, 25 Sep - Teegan: You should
12:57, 25 Sep - Joe Jarman: Why isn't it bum size linked to breast cancer
12:58, 25 Sep - Owen James: The skirt doesn't even cover the breasts!  How the hell would it cause them to get cancer!
12:58, 25 Sep - Joe Jarman: Although I imagine there is some seriously positive correlation with bum size and boob size
13:00, 25 Sep - Bongo: I reckon we should all just go naked from the waist down to avoid looking stupid
13:02, 25 Sep - Joe Jarman: Naaaah waist up, nobody wants to see that bongo, put it away!
13:04, 25 Sep - Owen James: Wait. So a size 8 is less likely to get cancer than a size 14. Why don't they just say people who are larger are generally less healthy. The skirt thing is irrelevant!!!
13:09, 25 Sep - Vanessa "Beast" Matthews: I'm not sure where they got the correlation of waist size for breast cancer. But there is a definite relation between waist size and heart disease, which is not a cancer
13:09, 25 Sep - Vanessa "Beast" Matthews: I just read the article and it's pretty poorly written
13:48, 25 Sep - Bunn: Pints in the george tonight?
13:56, 25 Sep - Dave Mendez: Doig! Not sure. What's the occasion?
14:13, 25 Sep - Shaggy Crazy Horse: Going to that gig in angel tonight

18:37, 25 Sep - Vanessa "Beast" Matthews: They have kraken so all is good
18:37, 25 Sep - Slam: Try and get an outdoors seat, I want to smoke and drink beer

09:01, 26 Sep - Marth: Montage scene. GO CATE!
09:32, 26 Sep - Owen James: How much is the bonus? If it is more then 300 the rational choice would be to just buy yourself a monkey (or whatever percentage of a monkey is equal to 300).
10:04, 26 Sep - ‚Ä™+44 7754 268447‚Ä¨: Haha. The bonus is 10%. Or five monkies (?) Not sure where this cost of monkey estimate has come from Owen!
10:07, 26 Sep - Adamina Carden: üôäÓàÅüôâÓÑïüôàÓîüüòÜ
11:03, 26 Sep - Owen James: 10% of everything over the bonus limit? Or 10% of all your sales for the month?
12:11, 26 Sep - Adamina Carden: So I just discovered that since 2011 LOL has been formally recognized in the Oxford dictionary

16:50, 28 Sep - Bongo: What's the BBQ situation like?
16:54, 28 Sep - Slam: We're through round 1, having meat naps currently
16:54, 28 Sep - Slam: Addy's left us some homemade burgers if you fancy one
16:57, 28 Sep - Teegan: Sorry to miss this momentous occasion
16:57, 28 Sep - Teegan: Needs to be a Sunday of penitence though
16:57, 28 Sep - Slam: You were in our hearts
16:58, 28 Sep - Slam: What happened?
16:58, 28 Sep - Teegan: My parents were staying
16:59, 28 Sep - Teegan: Feel like if we can't get through a weekend of moderation with them then I'm pretty much genetically screwed
16:59, 28 Sep - Teegan: And I will always have to have sunday hangovers
08:34, 29 Sep - Slam: Sorry to do a Hannah guys but...
08:34, 29 Sep - Slam: <Media omitted>

09:54, 29 Sep - Bunn: To youtube!
10:28, 29 Sep - Owen James: Your like Ron Swanson sam.
10:28, 29 Sep - Owen James: You're*
10:49, 29 Sep - Adamina Carden: So it's almost October. Anyone keen to arrange a trip to Thorpe Park Fright Nights
10:51, 29 Sep - Kritzia: Sam!!!! He loves the rollercoasters ;)
10:51, 29 Sep - Kritzia: And me!! I haven't been in a park for ages!  I always faint though
11:04, 29 Sep - Slam: I've never been on a roller coaster, feels a little strange to make it to 28 and then pop my cherry
11:06, 29 Sep - Dave Mendez: It'll be even stranger of you make it to 29
11:06, 29 Sep - Dave Mendez: if
11:08, 29 Sep - Adamina Carden: Haha true. Even numbers are best
12:28, 29 Sep - Bunn: Ive never been on one of those massive ones either
12:29, 29 Sep - Shaggy Crazy Horse: That's what she said
12:32, 29 Sep - Bunn: <Media omitted>
12:36, 29 Sep - Owen James: Sam. My pension counts as an untaxed allowance correct?
12:37, 29 Sep - Owen James: So my taxable income is my income minus my pension.
12:37, 29 Sep - Owen James: And minus NI?
12:40, 29 Sep - Owen James: Wait. The ¬£10,000 limit before you start having to pay tax counts as an allowance.
12:41, 29 Sep - Owen James: ?
12:41, 29 Sep - Owen James: Be on lunch break already. I want answers!!
12:44, 29 Sep - Owen James: Never mind. I figured it out.
12:45, 29 Sep - Owen James: By the way. If you earn less than 41k then tax on dividends is only 10% compared to the 20% on regular savings. If you earn more than that then dividend tax is 32.5%
12:46, 29 Sep - Mike: Banter
12:47, 29 Sep - Owen James: Lel
12:47, 29 Sep - Owen James: What I just said was wrong anyway.
12:47, 29 Sep - Owen James: There is a 10% tax credit.
12:48, 29 Sep - Owen James: So if you earn below 41k you pay no tax on dividends.
12:48, 29 Sep - Owen James: And 22.5% if you earn more than 41k.
12:48, 29 Sep - Shaggy Crazy Horse: Yawn
12:49, 29 Sep - Owen James: Fine. Go invest your money somewhere stupid like up your arse!
12:50, 29 Sep - Shaggy Crazy Horse: I invest my money into beer, and my fund, read stomach, has swollen enough to show that it's a good choice
12:51, 29 Sep - Teegan: Plus investment in liver cirrhosis at this stage negates the need to think about retirement plans
12:52, 29 Sep - Teegan: Morbid, yet simple
12:53, 29 Sep - Owen James: Ok well I'm going to choose companies with a high price to earnings ratio and..... who am I kidding I'll invest in booze as well.
12:54, 29 Sep - Adamina Carden: Woo boozevestment
12:57, 29 Sep - Slam: Great bant-ccountancy Owen, thanks
12:58, 29 Sep - Slam: And the 10% credit means you actually get money back for getting dividend income, it's to encourage poor people to invest in the market, which I find weird on a few levels
12:59, 29 Sep - Adamina Carden: In other news. I just watched three episodes of parks and rec back to back
12:59, 29 Sep - Bunn: Get a job
13:00, 29 Sep - Adamina Carden: I have a job. It's called couch tuner
13:01, 29 Sep - Bunn: Haha. Aw man i wish i was watching parks and rec!
13:03, 29 Sep - Adamina Carden: You could be. If you quit. He he he
13:04, 29 Sep - Adamina Carden: True fact: addiction to parks and rec us the heading cause of unemployment
13:05, 29 Sep - Teegan: Neither true, nor a fact. But 'true fact' is a truism.
13:05, 29 Sep - Teegan: So there's that
13:06, 29 Sep - Teegan: Man, I'm in a monday mood. Sigh.
13:07, 29 Sep - Bunn: I just ate a lovely Gulash from EAT
13:07, 29 Sep - Bunn: That helped
13:07, 29 Sep - Teegan: I decided to try itsu again. Bad decision.
13:07, 29 Sep - Teegan: That shit is nasty.
13:10, 29 Sep - Kritzia: Hahahaha !   I'm in I won't work again mood, so I'll participate in any sort of conversa!!! it's been a very very slow day :$
13:16, 29 Sep - ‚Ä™+44 7502 048124‚Ä¨: I leave my job tomorrow. So anything I do badly today is someone else's problem. Comforting. And in no way motivating.
13:17, 29 Sep - Kritzia: ÓåíÓåíÓåí congrats! !!
13:37, 29 Sep - Teegan: Party cones!
14:45, 29 Sep - Slam: I love itsu! The rare salmon steak is one of my all time favorite work lunches
15:14, 29 Sep - Teegan: They leave a lot to be desired in the world of noodle soups
15:15, 29 Sep - Teegan: Tomato soup isn't Japanese!
15:15, 29 Sep - Teegan: They have taken 'fusion' to a terrible place
15:23, 29 Sep - ‚Ä™+44 7807 744465‚Ä¨: Soup is poor but their sushi is the top
15:27, 29 Sep - Teegan: They also don't do any veg sushi really
15:27, 29 Sep - Teegan: Which makes wasabi my lunchtime fave
15:33, 29 Sep - Angela: Itsu used to have some really nice veggie potsu but they have got rid of them and replaced them with chicken and duck. I was mighty disappointed and now all their veggie food sucks
15:34, 29 Sep - Angela: Apart from "selected stores", lucky bastards.
15:35, 29 Sep - Angela: Best veggie sushi is crushh. Crussh?
15:35, 29 Sep - Angela: It all looks wrong!

16:03, 30 Sep - Angela: I don't even know how to express how that comment made me feel
16:03, 30 Sep - Angela: A cross between amusement and horror
16:04, 30 Sep - Angela: üôÄüòøüòπ

13:06, 20 Oct - Adamina Carden: Hahaha. Agreed with Bunn. It's an awful link... It may lead to sweet delicious Marilyn, but the link itself Óêá
13:06, 20 Oct - ‚Ä™+44 7502 048124‚Ä¨: Doesn't really help your argument
13:46, 20 Oct - Adamina Carden: Hey kids, so erryone who wants to come Saturday the place is booked at 1:45 so I suggest meeting at Uxbridge station at 12:30 in full kigu if possible. We cab either get a public transport bus which takes Ca. 20-30 min, or I book a taxi for fifteen purple or so (Phil kinda knows wagwan just not specifics)... Also if you've no idea what I'm on about message me directly.
14:42, 20 Oct - Marth: You can probably take a bike on the train since its a weekend, so I'll probably do that, any other takers?
14:51, 20 Oct - Shaggy Crazy Horse: Sounds like a good idea
14:53, 20 Oct - Adamina Carden: Hmmm yea bike actually would be cool
16:36, 20 Oct - Mike: You can't cycle from Canning town to Uxbridge
16:36, 20 Oct - Mike: Well I mean, you can, but it will take like 2 hours
16:37, 20 Oct - Bunn: Bike on train
16:38, 20 Oct - Bunn: Then cycle the rest once train reaches station
16:42, 20 Oct - Mike: What train?
16:43, 20 Oct - Adamina Carden: Metropolitan
16:43, 20 Oct - Joe Jarman: That's not a train
16:43, 20 Oct - Joe Jarman: Ie no bike
16:44, 20 Oct - Slam: You can do it from anywhere it goes overground, so cycle to baker street or something
16:44, 20 Oct - Slam: Not the dlr though, I got stung like that once
16:45, 20 Oct - Bunn: Yeah i was thinking cycle to west london first
16:45, 20 Oct - Bunn: All sounds like quite a lot of effort tbh!
16:45, 20 Oct - Mike: You guys are keen!
16:46, 20 Oct - Mike: I am not gonna risk getting drunk afterwards
16:46, 20 Oct - Joe Jarman: 3.5 mile cycle from slough train station

17:25, 20 Oct - Marth: Good shout, thanks doc!
17:27, 20 Oct - Joe Jarman: Sounds expensive, what's the difference between that and uxbridge oyster business?
17:42, 20 Oct - Adamina Carden: I reation cheaper to oyster to Uxbridge
17:44, 20 Oct - Dave Mendez: Its 3 quid off peak to Uxbridge from zone 1, unless its changes since march

30 Oct 2014 12:13 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: What the fuck did you just fucking say about me, you little bitch? I‚Äôll have you know I graduated top of my class in the Navy Seals, and I‚Äôve been involved in numerous secret raids on Al-Quaeda, and I have over 300 confirmed kills. I am trained in gorilla warfare and I‚Äôm the top sniper in the entire US armed forces. You are nothing to me but just another target. I will wipe you the fuck out with precision the likes of which has never been seen before on this Earth, mark my fucking words. You think you can get away with saying that shit to me over the Internet? Think again, fucker. As we speak I am contacting my secret network of spies across the¬†USAand your IP is being traced right now so you better prepare for the storm, maggot. The storm that wipes out the pathetic little thing you call your life. You‚Äôre fucking dead, kid. I can be anywhere, anytime, and I can kill you in over seven hundred ways, and that‚Äôs just with my bare hands. Not only am I extensively trained in unarmed combat, but I have access to the entire arsenal of the United States Marine Corps and I will use it to its full extent to wipe your miserable ass off the face of the continent, you little shit. If only you could have known what unholy retribution your little ‚Äúclever‚Äù comment was about to bring down upon you, maybe you would have held your fucking tongue. But you couldn‚Äôt, you didn‚Äôt, and now you‚Äôre paying the price, you goddamn idiot. I will shit fury all over you and you will drown in it. You‚Äôre fucking dead, kiddo.

4 Nov 2014 12:09 - Joe Jarman: Failing that, ben thanh market
4 Nov 2014 12:09 - Adimina: Haha
4 Nov 2014 12:56 - Owen: For a while i was trying to understand that as some racist joke. "Are black people often homeless or something?!"

Then i 2014 realised you meant the camping shop.
4 Nov 2014 12:59 - Owen: Maybe they are avid campers. Thats not a sterotype I have heard though.
4 Nov 2014 13:05 - Adimina: Racist Owen
4 Nov 2014 13:08 - Joe Jarman: Black people hate camping, thus more.likely to give up sleeping bags?! Óêâ

4 Nov 2014 17:08 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: 4 MORE YEARS! 4 MORE YEARS!
4 Nov 2014 19:01 - Lorna: Maybe you could afford a deposit and buy the house if you all club together...
4 Nov 2014 19:04 - Owen: You clearly haven't seen how much money that house spends on beer lorna üòÉ
4 Nov 2014 19:05 - Owen: They could probably get the deposit by saving up a week's worth of empties and selling the aluminum.
4 Nov 2014 19:11 - Bongo: Yea but then the cleaner wouldn't have anything to pick up
4 Nov 2014 19:26 - Sam Roberts: Can't believe she's lasted so long
4 Nov 2014 19:26 - Sam Roberts: Even through bin-gate, and this Saturday's binge fest
4 Nov 2014 19:28 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: Didn't the landlord get it for like 50k?
4 Nov 2014 21:26 - Sam Roberts: ¬£50 and a bag full of nails
4 Nov 2014 21:55 - Bongo: Lol bin-gate
4 Nov 2014 21:57 - Bongo: Some witch was like "have this house on yonder but beware! mould grows everywhere, ye shall be plagued by rats and forever there will be the foulest stench enflicted upon man"
4 Nov 2014 21:57 - Bongo: But lucky for him he found you guys
4 Nov 2014 22:13 - Owen: I think the foul stench will clear itself right up when phil goes abroad for a bit.
4 Nov 2014 22:21 - Sam Roberts: That's the only thing keeping the mould at bay

5 Nov 2014 12:57 - Owen: A conversation i just overheard between two kids: "do you think scorpion from mortal kombat could overcome the combined might of the chaos gods on battle?"... I teach such nerds!
5 Nov 2014 12:57 - Owen: They are literally like comic book guy from the simpsons.
5 Nov 2014 12:59 - Sam Roberts: .... well could he?
5 Nov 2014 13:01 - Adimina: <Media omitted>
5 Nov 2014 13:01 - Adimina: Look who's come to say hello
5 Nov 2014 13:03 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: Scorpion ain't all that
5 Nov 2014 13:33 - Phil: Shut your dirty mouth mike you sub human sub zero fanboy. Obviously scorpion can't battle all the chaos gods but he'd do better than pretty much anyone else.
5 Nov 2014 14:07 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: People just like scorpion cause of the stupid sob story. He's like those contestants on X factor who are on there cause their dad died even though everyone knows they won't win
5 Nov 2014 14:14 - Alex Bunn: üëèüëè
5 Nov 2014 14:29 - Phil: The sob story came later when the drooling masses couldn't handle that a bad ass ninja had no back story beyond being a bad ass ninja.
5 Nov 2014 14:48 - Shaggy: Yellow is a pretty awesome colour
5 Nov 2014 14:50 - Owen: Scorpion is a pretty awesome animal.
5 Nov 2014 15:26 - Dave: Skulls are cool
5 Nov 2014 15:43 - Shaggy: And so is fire
5 Nov 2014 16:00 - Phil: Also, harpoons.
5 Nov 2014 16:13 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: These are dumb arguments
5 Nov 2014 16:16 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: He's a cheap-ass teleporting bitch
5 Nov 2014 16:19 - Phil: Someone got his ass beat by scorpion to many times. He was just the vessel man.

9 Nov 2014 20:14 - Martha: Yes. Have to buy them in advance since it usually sells out. There may not be many left next to each other though. Would people prefer to be loners sitting on their own or should we go for Tuesday?
9 Nov 2014 20:15 - Sam Roberts: I'm totally climbing Tuesday, well in for tomorrow though
9 Nov 2014 20:15 - Sam Roberts: Can we see how next to each other we are? Pairs would be ok

9 Nov 2014 21:07 - Sam Roberts: The horde, always
9 Nov 2014 21:08 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: I prefer Tues at the Barbican

11 Nov 2014 09:42 - Dave: Can you imagine?
11 Nov 2014 10:48 - Sam Roberts: Thought it was a super racist headline in first glance, I'm much happier at the thought of ninja terrorist Mike
11 Nov 2014 12:46 - Phil: I think that is the closest anyone can reasonably come to being called a teenage mutant ninja turtle by a newspaper. Congrats mike.

11 Nov 2014 19:49 - Shaggy: Yus
11 Nov 2014 19:51 - Lorna: I'm super close
11 Nov 2014 20:12 - Shaggy: We're in the barbican centre, need to go to level -2
12 Nov 2014 10:33 - Alex Bunn: I think interstellar is worth a second watch
12 Nov 2014 10:33 - Alex Bunn: With lowered expectations
12 Nov 2014 10:33 - Alex Bunn: There was a lot to be appreciated in that film
12 Nov 2014 10:33 - Alex Bunn: But there was also a lot that was lame
12 Nov 2014 10:34 - Owen: Phil needs to see it again definitely. Because he spent half the film in the loo
12 Nov 2014 10:34 - Alex Bunn: Shit. Probably not worth a convo here cos theres peeps that havnt seen it
12 Nov 2014 10:34 - Henry Dranks: I absolutely loved it. beautiful homage to some of my fav scifi
12 Nov 2014 10:34 - Sam Roberts: It's weird, I really enjoyed maybe 9/10 of it, but felt cheated by the end
12 Nov 2014 10:34 - Owen: The last 15 minutes just shouldn't have been in the film
12 Nov 2014 10:35 - Tegan: Lots of Sci Fi films s have that quality though
12 Nov 2014 10:36 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: Yeah like Source Code
12 Nov 2014 10:37 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: Interstellar was pretty daft, can't say I wasn't entertained though
12 Nov 2014 10:37 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: Low marks for the Barbican cinema though
12 Nov 2014 10:37 - Shaggy: I think Matthew mcconaghey had a speech impediment, did he have a stroke?
12 Nov 2014 10:37 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: I think its more that the sound was shit
12 Nov 2014 10:38 - Owen: Yeah barbican cinema was rubbish
12 Nov 2014 10:38 - Owen: Barbican't  more like! Amiright?!
12 Nov 2014 10:38 - Alex Bunn: Yeah i think we might have had a better experience somewhere else
12 Nov 2014 10:38 - Alex Bunn: My fave was the sarcastic robot
12 Nov 2014 10:38 - Shaggy: IMAX
12 Nov 2014 10:49 - Martha: Meh, I agree the screen was pretty weeny, but it was nice to go somewhere close to me for once. Thank you folks for coming to my neck of the woods! That wins you 3 times I don't complain about going east :)
12 Nov 2014 10:49 - Martha: Sarcastic robot wins it.
12 Nov 2014 10:50 - Owen: Marthican't more like! Amiright folks!?
12 Nov 2014 10:50 - Owen: üêõ
12 Nov 2014 10:51 - Sam Roberts: Could've done with subtitles
12 Nov 2014 10:52 - Martha: I just realised: you know that film 'contact' I said it was quite like? Matthew mcconnorghdkdkd was in that too.
12 Nov 2014 10:52 - Sam Roberts: I liked the barbican centre though, felt like we were running through a Kafka novel to get there
12 Nov 2014 10:52 - Martha: Yes to subtitles, then we might have been able to understand over bun's rustling.
12 Nov 2014 10:54 - Sam Roberts: Hahaha I'd forgotten that! Full points for rustling bunny!
12 Nov 2014 11:30 - Alex Bunn: Shouldve munched during re-entry
12 Nov 2014 11:31 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: Or during one of those organ solos
12 Nov 2014 11:33 - Joe Jarman: Anyone left who hasn't seen it?
12 Nov 2014 11:33 - Joe Jarman: I want to go today üòÑ
12 Nov 2014 12:05 - Phil: I went for one perfectly timed piss. I missed a few minutes of crying and "daddy please don't go".

12 Nov 2014 18:40 - Owen: Which flat are you?

13 Nov 2014 08:09 - Owen: Wow. Isn't it ironic than palindnilap is also a palindnilap.
13 Nov 2014 08:21 - Hannah Murphy: There are 2 types of people in the world. Those who can extrapolate from incomplete data.
13 Nov 2014 08:33 - Owen: And mutant lizard men?

14 Nov 2014 11:14 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: <Media omitted>
14 Nov 2014 11:14 - Tegan: I think Mike also counts each consecutive Newgate from one person as one message
14 Nov 2014 11:15 - Tegan: So you need to be more strategic
14 Nov 2014 11:15 - Tegan: Nice
14 Nov 2014 11:18 - Hannah Murphy: Impish!

14 Nov 2014 11:24 - Owen: OP will deliver....?
14 Nov 2014 11:33 - Sam Roberts: *did. I wonder if text typos are improving humanity's lateral thinking. It's like every fifth message is a little logic puzzle
14 Nov 2014 11:35 - Owen: I was thinking 'disappeared'
14 Nov 2014 11:42 - Dan Sluckin: ...membered 12 people in that incident.
14 Nov 2014 11:45 - Owen: He didn't quit, he was committed to a mental asylum after all that dismembering.

14 Nov 2014 12:18 - Tegan: Exemplary. Did you see mike's last horde analysis?
14 Nov 2014 12:18 - Owen: Sam better be careful because someone likes italians too much.
14 Nov 2014 12:19 - Tegan: (The idea that that is shaggy's problem is more than gently misogynistic)
14 Nov 2014 12:20 - Owen: Dave! Get your woman back in line. She is talking out of turn!
14 Nov 2014 12:22 - Tegan: Looking for an emoji to express my feminist vitriol...

5 Dec 2014 14:12 - Sam Roberts: Haha that took me way too long
5 Dec 2014 14:12 - Sam Roberts: Looks like nothing changed!
5 Dec 2014 14:14 - Martha: Not much to be honest! It looks a bit richer here and there (fancy tv screens, scary automatic video capture in all of the lecture rooms) but it's still a nostalgia bonanza.
5 Dec 2014 14:22 - Tegan: Nice
5 Dec 2014 15:55 - Dave: How did your talk go?
5 Dec 2014 16:00 - Martha: Went well, thanks!!

7 Dec 2014 02:47 - Alex Bunn: It was way coool
7 Dec 2014 02:48 - Alex Bunn: I caught my front wheel in a drain while i did a super cool undertaking manouvre
7 Dec 2014 02:48 - Alex Bunn: And then i had to get the super cool nightbus home

8 Dec 2014 18:22 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: <Media omitted>
8 Dec 2014 19:27 - Vinay: Lol
8 Dec 2014 19:28 - Vinay: I'm up for skating on Wednesday... Hopefully it won't be raining
9 Dec 2014 13:36 - Dave: Would anyone like to take my place kayaking from Limehouse to the Victoria park winter wonderland thing? It clashes with my work Xmas meal. Happy to offer the ticket at a good discount. X
9 Dec 2014 13:46 - Shaggy: Lol you have to pay money to do it?!
9 Dec 2014 14:18 - Joe Jarman: Yeah it sounds pretty brutal kayaking in this weather
9 Dec 2014 14:19 - Tegan: We didn't remember what cold was like when we signed up
9 Dec 2014 14:19 - Tegan: I'm probably going to end up in tears
9 Dec 2014 14:20 - Tegan: Good group though- Petia etc
9 Dec 2014 14:21 - Phil: Is petia a group or a person?
9 Dec 2014 14:22 - Joe Jarman: I like those guys
9 Dec 2014 14:22 - Joe Jarman: Petias not a big joe jarman fan
9 Dec 2014 14:22 - Joe Jarman: I think I consumed something naughty off her macbook

9 Dec 2014 14:23 - Joe Jarman: But I have my work party tomorrow
9 Dec 2014 14:23 - Tegan: Il have stopped crying by then
9 Dec 2014 14:23 - Tegan: Ah well
9 Dec 2014 14:45 - Sam Roberts: Who's organising? Well there be wet suits?
9 Dec 2014 14:47 - Tegan: BYO :(
9 Dec 2014 14:47 - Sam Roberts: Winter wonderland would be an excellent meet up and skate place
9 Dec 2014 14:47 - +44 7944 609055 left
9 Dec 2014 14:52 - Shaggy: I would cut your losses right now and bail, like em just now
9 Dec 2014 14:57 - Sam Roberts: That'd be awesome with a proper suit+ gloves
9 Dec 2014 15:08 - Tegan: Nah,  I'm gon' do it.  Join us after for mulled wine? Is there an ice rink at the Victoria Park winterthingaling?
9 Dec 2014 15:08 - Sam Roberts: I'll give you 40% survival without
9 Dec 2014 15:21 - Alex Bunn: In victoria park yes there is obe
9 Dec 2014 19:30 - Dave: Sam, sounds like you'd like my ticket...
9 Dec 2014 19:33 - Sam Roberts: Gimme a wetsuit and I'm there!
9 Dec 2014 19:34 - Sam Roberts: How much are the tickets?
9 Dec 2014 19:34 - Phil: Surely you can't kayak in this weather without a wetsuit. This is a country where they barely trust people near ankle deep water without a 2m railing and some barbed wire
9 Dec 2014 19:36 - Dave: I'm loathed to say how much the tickets were but for you, ¬£15.
9 Dec 2014 19:41 - Tegan: Brown wooded butttocks

9 Dec 2014 19:49 - Sam Roberts: That all worked out nicely! Need anything from the shop Phil?
9 Dec 2014 19:50 - Phil: Depends if you want stir fry. If yes, read house bants.
9 Dec 2014 20:21 - Tegan: Hope I didn't put you out of your way with my Wolf boy beer cry
9 Dec 2014 20:24 - Sam Roberts: Made me leave the office as it happens, I'm cook with that woolfie

10 Dec 2014 12:12 - Sam Roberts: Victoria park for winter wonderland + seeing if Teeg survives
10 Dec 2014 12:13 - Sam Roberts: The guys can skate and the ladies can drink mulled wine and watch
10 Dec 2014 13:29 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: Apparently we're going to WW after the office Xmas party on Friday
10 Dec 2014 13:30 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: What could go wrong
10 Dec 2014 13:31 - Shaggy: What's that?

10 Dec 2014 13:54 - Dave: Looks like I'm gonna be kayaking too. The more warm hugs the better at vikkie park
10 Dec 2014 16:38 - Sam Roberts: Sooo I've got a heap still to do, looks like I might be stuck here for the night :(
10 Dec 2014 16:39 - Sam Roberts: You got to love having a nice relaxing morning , then finding a shitstorm when you get back
10 Dec 2014 16:52 - Owen: What time and where are people going to be?

10 Dec 2014 18:10 - Alex Bunn: Pub in London Bridge?
10 Dec 2014 18:12 - Sam Roberts: No word from teeg and Dave, I think they've succumbed to hypothermia already
10 Dec 2014 18:12 - Sam Roberts: I'm going to be stuck here couple of hours at least, might come join if you're out though
10 Dec 2014 18:13 - Alex Bunn: Thats what i was hoping for. Need to organise something due to my lack of phone network and dependency on wifi
10 Dec 2014 18:14 - Alex Bunn: Phil if we decide will you come?
10 Dec 2014 18:24 - Alex Bunn: Ok i'm going home
10 Dec 2014 18:24 - Alex Bunn: Bye

10 Dec 2014 18:30 - Phil: üêí

10 Dec 2014 22:30 - Tegan: Yup, kayaking is also pretty toasty it turns out :)

11 Dec 2014 16:12 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: Rice + laxative?
11 Dec 2014 16:13 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: Favourite business terms at qubit seem to be 'deep-dive (into)' and 'verticals'
11 Dec 2014 16:16 - Phil: Urban dictionary word of the day: a crapella
11 Dec 2014 16:30 - Tegan: We're always deep diving into verticals
11 Dec 2014 16:30 - Tegan: Do you do much silo-ing?
11 Dec 2014 17:43 - Bongo: My favourite business term is haircut
11 Dec 2014 17:43 - Bongo: Although it's only a financial one

14 Dec 2014 11:20 - Owen: Why was she removed instead of leaving? Bit rude, no?
14 Dec 2014 11:20 - Alex Bunn: Pipe down

28 Dec 2014 22:06 - Phil left
28 Dec 2014 22:07 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: <Media omitted>
28 Dec 2014 22:07 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: NOOOO
28 Dec 2014 23:10 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: Well, I for one am shocked, saddened, and quite drunk by the lack of uproar at this loss.  People leave this group all the time. Usually if I have any reaction at all, it's a positive one. Good riddance says I, for a herd of buffulo can only move as fast as its slowest, and least comical member.  But tonight, we have lost a true The Horde titan. He never contributed a lot, but everything he did was hilariously accurate, terse, and withering in execution. He will be sorely missed.
28 Dec 2014 23:10 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: <Media omitted>

29 Dec 2014 16:26 - Joe Jarman: Alternatively the guest looks pretty sweet
29 Dec 2014 16:34 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: Viable options are Hobbit, Big Eyes, or if you want to come to West End we can try and catch a preview of Birdman

29 Dec 2014 18:14 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: Deal.
29 Dec 2014 18:33 - Owen: That explains why the beer would be better.
29 Dec 2014 18:37 - Sam Roberts: The other Brown's
29 Dec 2014 18:45 - Owen: I like how bongo knows all the strip clubs.

6 Jan 16:39 - Alex Bunn: Wtf is that movie?
6 Jan 16:40 - Owen: Maybe. However i can imagine the film being about motor neuron disease instead of black hole mathematics like it should be!
6 Jan 16:42 - Joe Jarman: Can't ya just come round and make pie already
6 Jan 16:46 - Tegan: I think it's mainly about stevesy. With some black hole mathematics.
6 Jan 16:46 - Tegan: It is named erroneously
6 Jan 16:46 - Tegan: S' meant to be aiight though
6 Jan 16:47 - Tegan: No pie

7 Jan 08:44 - Sam Roberts: We're going tonight... Friday drinks to break it down?
7 Jan 09:19 - Joe Jarman: Aww my god, that was the most racist haircut ever

7 Jan 09:26 - Joe Jarman: Peter's hairdresser at the end of our road
7 Jan 09:36 - Tegan: I don't know if you guys should be financially spring racists
7 Jan 09:36 - Tegan: Supporting
7 Jan 09:36 - Tegan: Do you have to ask him race related questions to hear it,  or does the hate just come pouring out?
7 Jan 09:37 - Owen: "So what kind of negro haircut do you want today. Also i think the pakis shouldn't be allowed the vote."
7 Jan 09:37 - Owen: That kind of racist?
7 Jan 09:58 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: In my experience, most of his hate is at eastern Europeans
7 Jan 09:58 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: And immigrants in general
7 Jan 09:58 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: Which is weird because he's Italian
7 Jan 10:01 - Owen: Well all those poles come over here and eat our pasta.
7 Jan 10:15 - Joe Jarman: He is italian
7 Jan 10:16 - Joe Jarman: But he was here before we were even born apparently
7 Jan 10:16 - Joe Jarman: Which is amazing coz his english is really poor

7 Jan 12:00 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: We went there last time, how about the spoons?
7 Jan 12:03 - Owen: Wherever we go I will sit in a corner crying about the lack of booze.
7 Jan 12:03 - Owen: Can i smell your beer please mike?
7 Jan 12:06 - Tegan: Mike's on the white wine
7 Jan 12:06 - Tegan: Spritzeritzeritzers

7 Jan 12:13 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: My Dad, I got one

7 Jan 12:50 - Owen: Eliza is with ee. I think they do it as well.
7 Jan 12:53 - Lorna: Same thing, ee is a merge of orange and t mobile. Maybe t mobile wear the trousers which is why orange Wednesdays is finishing

7 Jan 14:12 - Alex Bunn: <Media omitted>

7 Jan 14:17 - Shaggy: I don't get it. Is that a deliberate misspelling?
7 Jan 14:18 - Alex Bunn: Itchy and scrathy land episode. Do your homework
7 Jan 14:18 - Alex Bunn: I'm disappointed
7 Jan 14:20 - Tegan: The gag is weakened by the fact that you can get a bart mug right next to it
7 Jan 14:20 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: omg Shaggy, like seriously

7 Jan 15:03 - Tegan: I'm sitting next to some people in a cafe who are talking about embezzling money in the Seychelles
7 Jan 15:03 - Tegan: Who do I call? ?
7 Jan 15:09 - Alex Bunn: Infiltrate their circle of trust
7 Jan 15:14 - Tegan: Probable false alarm.  I think they're just idiots.
7 Jan 15:14 - Tegan: Probably rich idiots.
7 Jan 15:22 - Shaggy: She sells Seychelles
7 Jan 15:27 - Tegan: But where?
7 Jan 15:31 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: On the East African real estate market
7 Jan 15:46 - Owen: Tell them you can help them. Then steal all thier money. Stealings not wrong if you do it to rich idiots... like Kevin Bacon

7 Jan 16:04 - Tegan: Wisdom
7 Jan 16:38 - Sam Roberts: Never knew that! Most awesome!
7 Jan 16:38 - Sam Roberts: Just when you thought spoons couldn't get cheaper or more cheerful
7 Jan 16:39 - Sam Roberts: Everyone aiming for 7 then? I might be a touch early
7 Jan 16:41 - Tegan: Early sounds good
7 Jan 16:42 - Tegan: I still can't quite engender what my job is or why it's important
7 Jan 16:42 - Tegan: Remember,  dammit
7 Jan 16:42 - Tegan: This swipe business is getting worse and worse
7 Jan 16:47 - Lorna: I'll be a bit early. Is it 20% off drinks too?
7 Jan 16:55 - Tegan: I dunnoo
7 Jan 16:56 - Dave: Nah, but this is spoons so drinks are reasonable, even on the wharf.
7 Jan 17:03 - Alex Bunn: Cheapskates

19 Jan 21:01 - Owen: Yeah what the hell?! Did you hire your years supply of cleaners all at once?
19 Jan 21:01 - Owen: Or maybe it was shaggy causing all the mess all along.
19 Jan 21:03 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: Man you should see the projector room

22 Jan 14:14 - Sam Roberts: Pretty sure it isn't dude...
22 Jan 14:14 - Sam Roberts: You having that thing where you hear a word for the first time, then it's everywhere all of a sudden?
22 Jan 14:14 - Sam Roberts: I'm sure there'a a conspiracy around that
22 Jan 14:22 - Angela: There's a theory that says when you learn another language, you hear a word regularly without taking it in it for ages, and then one day when your ability gets good enough you suddenly 'notice' it and either understand it through context or you look it up or whatever. Then after that, you notice it every time it's said because you know it's there. Which is spooky if it's also true in English, cos it means you're just deaf to this word for years but it's actually been there all along.......
22 Jan 14:23 - Alex Bunn: Good fact!
22 Jan 14:23 - Sam Roberts: Oh god, have you all being talking about jingoistic braggadocio all this time!? I've been dead to it until now!

24 Jan 10:48 - Shaggy: Life without beer is like beer without alcohol
24 Jan 12:35 - Martha: I have some work but would enjoy a microbrew later

24 Jan 16:03 - Alex Bunn: Gonna cook dinner instead üòã
24 Jan 16:37 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: There's this demented airport up a mountain in courchevel
24 Jan 16:37 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: <Media omitted>
24 Jan 16:37 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: Youtube it, its crazy
24 Jan 17:01 - Lorna: <Media omitted>
24 Jan 17:03 - Alex Bunn: My uncle has flown his plane into that airport
24 Jan 17:05 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: Your uncle is mental
24 Jan 17:22 - Vanessa: How come I've never heard about this uncle
24 Jan 17:23 - Alex Bunn: Well unfortunately he's not with us anymore üòì
24 Jan 17:25 - Shaggy: Heaven is halfpipe
24 Jan 17:30 - Joe Jarman: Hey shagz gonna restart your thing
24 Jan 17:30 - Joe Jarman: Thin it's almost done
24 Jan 17:45 - Shaggy: I thought it was done
24 Jan 18:28 - Sam Roberts: Home brew!
24 Jan 18:29 - Sam Roberts: Hey, don't put it on yet
24 Jan 18:29 - Sam Roberts: We'll be done with this keg in a week, then we can have a brew off
24 Jan 18:29 - Alex Bunn: Hows the micro breweries?
24 Jan 18:29 - Alex Bunn: (Shags and V)
24 Jan 18:37 - Shaggy: Exquisite flavour of hops makes you really question the totalitarian rule of major corporate beer companies enthral lung their rule of blandness on out temporary existence
24 Jan 18:43 - Alex Bunn: And who says beer kills brain cells
24 Jan 20:01 - Tegan: Bastards
24 Jan 20:02 - Vinay: Jon snow
24 Jan 20:12 - Lorna: Too late Sam- beer's a brewin'. But we're gonna bottle it so it'll keep for a brew off.
24 Jan 23:34 - Sam Roberts: It's ON!
24 Jan 23:34 - Sam Roberts: I'm going to find out how to brew for high percentage, make some home brew special brew
25 Jan 01:01 - Lorna: If you brew with 1/10th of the water, then it'll make beer 10 times as strong right?...
25 Jan 01:09 - Sam Roberts: Sounds legit
25 Jan 01:10 - Sam Roberts: Or with 10x the sugar
25 Jan 01:11 - Sam Roberts: I hear the alcohol is just a calculation on the sugar
25 Jan 05:47 - Shaggy: Really? Sweet
25 Jan 09:15 - Owen: Alcohol content is sugar and yeast strain. Beer yeast will die at a lower abv than wine yeast.
25 Jan 10:09 - Lorna: So... Add wine yeast instead! This syrupy, sweet wine special brew will definitely give you the shits. üí©
25 Jan 12:21 - Dave: Mix in a load of vodka too.
25 Jan 12:21 - Dave: (Pro tip)
25 Jan 15:45 - Sam Roberts: Enjoying all of these, keep them coming
25 Jan 15:45 - Sam Roberts: Combined, I should be able to get beer over 30%
25 Jan 15:45 - Sam Roberts: I shall call it Tombstone
25 Jan 15:46 - Shaggy: You can freeze it and separate alcohol, there's one you can get in brewdog that's 52%
25 Jan 15:48 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: I think at some point you can't call it beer anymore haha
25 Jan 15:48 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: Sorites pissed paradox
27 Jan 07:31 - Tegan: Whiplash tonight at the wharf?
27 Jan 07:42 - Lorna: Yes to whiplash. Can I suggest a more central cinema?
27 Jan 07:47 - Tegan: We'll probably wharf as Dave has to work late
27 Jan 07:47 - Tegan: If he finishes wallet we could maybe get elsewhere
27 Jan 07:47 - Tegan: Had to be a cineworld for half price Tuesday
27 Jan 08:01 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: Down for whiplash,
27 Jan 08:02 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: Wherever, as long as you decide by like 6
27 Jan 12:11 - Lorna: Tuesday deal is good. Were you thinking 6:10 or 8:50 for the film?
27 Jan 13:16 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: Will have to be 8.50 for me
27 Jan 14:11 - Tegan: 8.50 sounds aiight
27 Jan 18:06 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: What time to meet?
27 Jan 18:16 - Hannah Murphy: <Media omitted>
27 Jan 18:16 - Hannah Murphy: <Media omitted>
27 Jan 18:20 - Hannah Murphy: I'm guessing number 16 bus shelter may be referring to a place of conception?
27 Jan 18:20 - Lorna: I'm bailing on the cinema guys
27 Jan 18:23 - Alex Bunn: Lol that bus stop kid is a born winner!
27 Jan 18:41 - Vanessa: I was told that in Germany you have to ask permission on the name you want to give your child
27 Jan 18:42 - Tegan: Mike, are you still up for the wharf?
27 Jan 18:47 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: Sure

27 Jan 21:05 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: <Media omitted>

27 Jan 23:26 - Owen: Good then.
27 Jan 23:26 - Owen: ?
27 Jan 23:37 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: Well I don't want to overhype it
27 Jan 23:37 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: But I have already, so yeah its amazing, see it at the cinema
27 Jan 23:41 - Tegan: Hype hype hype!
27 Jan 23:41 - Tegan: Made me angry
27 Jan 23:41 - Tegan: But was good
27 Jan 23:43 - Dave: Was pretty great. Visceral, exhausting cinema. In a good way.
28 Jan 06:42 - Angela: Why did it make you angry teegs?
28 Jan 07:41 - Tegan: Either because it celebrated a sad cycle of dependency, or because I'll never be that good at anything
28 Jan 07:41 - Tegan: Probably the latter
28 Jan 07:49 - Angela: Getting old to the point where that becomes apparent is rubbish! No longer do I have potential üò¢
28 Jan 07:49 - Angela: I had so much potential!
28 Jan 07:51 - Sam Roberts: I've switched from aiming at rock climbing legend to sexy pensioner
28 Jan 07:56 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: I don't agree that it celebrated it Teegs, it was pretty neutral
28 Jan 08:05 - Alex Bunn: Lol Sam
28 Jan 08:06 - Owen: I'll just aim for pensioner
28 Jan 08:18 - Tegan: That's why I did probably the later
28 Jan 08:18 - Tegan: Latter
28 Jan 08:19 - Tegan: I expect
28 Jan 08:19 - Tegan: Also lol, sam
28 Jan 08:41 - Sam Roberts: Talking of becoming a pensioner, it's m' birthday next Friday (6th), save the date for some drinking fun
28 Jan 08:49 - Adam Wills: Saved! What are we gonna do?
28 Jan 09:11 - Sam Roberts: Working on it just at the mo, suggestions welcome
28 Jan 09:11 - Sam Roberts: The only certainty is that there will be beers

28 Jan 09:33 - Shaggy: Oh right
28 Jan 09:33 - Alex Bunn: Too early
28 Jan 09:35 - Tegan: Sorry y'all
28 Jan 09:36 - Tegan: The sound you can probably hear is me cursing the day
28 Jan 12:48 - Sam Roberts: <Media omitted>

29 Jan 15:59 - Joe Jarman: What time you there sam
29 Jan 15:59 - Joe Jarman: I'm celebrating dodging a bankruptcy bullet
29 Jan 16:00 - Alex Bunn: Did you get redundancy?
29 Jan 16:02 - Joe Jarman: Not yet haha
29 Jan 16:02 - Joe Jarman: I'm just thankful for my student overdraft

29 Jan 17:31 - Bongo: Sweet I'm in
29 Jan 17:31 - Bongo: Like beef shin
29 Jan 17:31 - Bongo: <Media omitted>
29 Jan 17:31 - Bongo: Rubbed in garlic, parsley salt and balsal, left to cook for 8 hours
29 Jan 17:32 - Owen: Stab holes in it and push the garlic into the holes. It caramalises and infuses the meat when it cooks.
29 Jan 17:33 - Joe Jarman: See you at dlr?
29 Jan 17:33 - Owen: Trust me. Its a may zing!
29 Jan 17:33 - Dave: I'll be there in a min
29 Jan 17:34 - Shaggy: Garlic caramelises?
29 Jan 17:35 - Joe Jarman: When
29 Jan 17:35 - Joe Jarman: I'm there
29 Jan 17:35 - Joe Jarman: Smoking
29 Jan 17:36 - Dave: Now
29 Jan 17:37 - Joe Jarman: Canne c u jimmee
29 Jan 17:48 - Owen: Yeah garlic caramalises. If you deprive it of oxygen.
29 Jan 17:48 - Owen: Try wrapping a bulb of garlic in foil and sticking it in the oven at 180 for an hour. It comes out sticky and sweet but still as garlicy.
29 Jan 17:49 - Shaggy: Sweet
29 Jan 17:51 - Tegan: Mmmmmm
29 Jan 17:51 - Tegan: I'm going for a leaving drink, will join y'all afters

29 Jan 19:50 - Sam Roberts: Opposite the fellow, but they don't have a pin so I used the fellow one
29 Jan 19:50 - Sam Roberts: To be fair, happy hours over, and they don't have any Nintendo do we should probs move on
29 Jan 19:51 - Sam Roberts: Here for now though
29 Jan 20:44 - Tegan: Whattupp y'all?
29 Jan 20:46 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: We're in the same place
29 Jan 20:49 - Tegan: Surely the appeal wears off at 7?

29 Jan 20:50 - Tegan: On my wat5
29 Jan 20:50 - Joe Jarman: It's still cheap!
29 Jan 20:50 - Tegan: Sright

29 Jan 20:58 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: Where there's a will there's a wat5
29 Jan 21:13 - Tegan: WAT5 MOTHERLICKERS
29 Jan 21:14 - Tegan: It's snowing
29 Jan 21:16 - Vinay: Where? Its dry as a baboons backside here
29 Jan 21:16 - Tegan: Kx
29 Jan 21:16 - Vinay: I got all excited
29 Jan 21:16 - Owen: Damn you teegs you made me look out the window.
29 Jan 21:17 - Owen: I was disappointed
29 Jan 21:17 - Vinay: Same
29 Jan 21:17 - Tegan: It won't settle
29 Jan 21:17 - Tegan: It's mainly damp
29 Jan 21:17 - Owen: Watch "Hercules - DISAPPOINTED" on YouTube - Hercules - DISAPPOINTED: http://youtu.be/_O1hM-k3aUY
29 Jan 21:17 - Tegan: Definite snowfall here though
30 Jan 09:32 - Martha: What plans for tonight? I'm in need of a chilled one - I'm thinking good food and films/episodes and a comfy couch. Shabong? Canning t? What say you?
30 Jan 09:35 - Shaggy: Team bonding exercise with work, meaning team bonds with alcohol, somewhere near work
30 Jan 09:35 - Owen: Whatever you do don't be hungover tomorrow Marth
30 Jan 09:36 - Alex Bunn: I'm going to a medieval banquet in st katherines docks
30 Jan 09:36 - Alex Bunn: Its gonna be ossum
30 Jan 09:41 - Tegan: I'm up for an episode of something Marth
30 Jan 09:41 - Tegan: I'm in c town
30 Jan 09:54 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: Someone told me a good comedy film called Chef came out last year, anyone up for that?
30 Jan 11:00 - Martha: Sure, awesome! Teegs - are you heading to Sutton on Saturday morning too? It will make the epic trek from canning t infinitely more enjoyable.
30 Jan 11:07 - Dave: I'd like to see chef - it's downloaded already
30 Jan 11:15 - Owen: 1 hour an epic trek does not make.
30 Jan 11:33 - Martha: Indeed, but 1h27 is getting there.
30 Jan 11:33 - Martha: <Media omitted>
30 Jan 11:34 - Sam Roberts: Uber
30 Jan 11:41 - Tegan: I think I'll have to wend my way home tonight as my laundry situation is pretty dire
30 Jan 11:41 - Tegan: But we can meet at lb or wherever the train goes from
30 Jan 11:52 - Owen: Thats a stupid way to go.
30 Jan 11:52 - Owen: Jubilee to Canada water. Overground to west croydon. Mainline to sutton.
30 Jan 11:53 - Owen: That is the best way. Takes about 1hour if you get the right train.
30 Jan 12:53 - Martha: Aw rats, I thought you and Dave were coming. Owen is there a critical number of people below which we might be forced to drink, eat cake and play Catan?
30 Jan 12:54 - Owen: Teegs is coming. Dave is not
30 Jan 12:55 - Owen: At the moment the list is: marth, teegs, steve, alice, lara, jim, eliza.
30 Jan 12:55 - Owen: So quite a few
30 Jan 13:41 - Lorna: By the way guys, chef is awesome! Comedy that gives you a warm gooey heartwarming feel. With shit loads of food porn. Eat before or line up and epic meat/cheese snack for afters.
30 Jan 14:07 - Alex Bunn: <Media omitted>
30 Jan 18:35 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: OK, so what do you think is the biggest animal by mass that you could have in a fight?
30 Jan 18:36 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: It is trying to kill you
30 Jan 18:36 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: No weapons, MMA octagon stylee
30 Jan 18:36 - Tegan: Could definitely take a cat
30 Jan 18:36 - Tegan: Or cat sized dog
30 Jan 18:36 - Owen: Blue whale.
30 Jan 18:37 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: Land animal
30 Jan 18:37 - Tegan: Probably not a Badger
30 Jan 18:37 - Owen: It's own weight would kill it in an mma octagon
30 Jan 18:39 - Lorna: Could definitely take a giant tortoise. Though its unlikely to ever try and kill me.
30 Jan 18:39 - Martha: Sloth
30 Jan 18:39 - Tegan: Good thinking lorna
30 Jan 18:39 - Tegan: Heavy but slow animals
30 Jan 18:40 - Owen: Maybe a crocodile. They can't open thier jaws if you apply a little force to them. I am not sure how I would kill it though. Maybe finger through the eye to the brain.
30 Jan 18:40 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: You could not even hope to hurt a tortoise though
30 Jan 18:41 - Owen: Kick it in the balls!
30 Jan 18:41 - Owen: No animal can cope with that.
30 Jan 18:41 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: Unless you flip it over and they're well heavy
30 Jan 18:42 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: I feel I could take a giraffe somehow
30 Jan 18:42 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: Would need a good strategy
30 Jan 18:42 - Owen: No way!
30 Jan 18:42 - Martha: I feel that you would find you cant
30 Jan 18:42 - Owen: Have you seen those fuckers fight?
30 Jan 18:43 - Owen: They neck whip each other.
30 Jan 18:43 - Owen: Giraffes are BAD ASS!
30 Jan 18:43 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: You got to trip it over somehow
30 Jan 18:43 - Shaggy: <Media omitted>
30 Jan 18:44 - Lorna: I'd flip that tortoise and elbow drop it. WWF style
30 Jan 18:46 - Tegan: Dang
30 Jan 18:47 - Lorna: Or a panda. Anyone could take a panda
30 Jan 18:49 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: Again, I think it would be tough to harm a panda
30 Jan 18:50 - Tegan: Are you allowed a rope?
30 Jan 18:50 - Alex Bunn: Yeah pandas suck
30 Jan 18:50 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: You'd have to hurt its feelings somehow
30 Jan 18:50 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: No ropes
30 Jan 18:50 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: I reckon a cow is doable
30 Jan 18:51 - Owen: A cow is basically a bull without horns though
30 Jan 18:51 - Tegan: Cows ares pretty solid
30 Jan 18:52 - Tegan: I reckon you could kick a sheep to death
30 Jan 18:52 - Owen: I don't really know how to kill any animal
30 Jan 18:52 - Owen: Except a chicken.
30 Jan 18:52 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: Giraffe you can strangle I reckon
30 Jan 18:52 - Martha: Guys this is pretty dark.
30 Jan 18:52 - Martha: Who started this?
30 Jan 18:52 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: Dave
30 Jan 18:53 - Martha: Mmm really?
30 Jan 18:53 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: Actually I'm continuing a convo from lunch
30 Jan 18:53 - Martha: My bets are on you for some reason
30 Jan 18:53 - Owen: I think you underestimate how big a giraffe's neck is.
30 Jan 18:53 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: It was much darker than this...
30 Jan 18:57 - Tegan: Mike, are you heading back to watch chef tonight?
30 Jan 18:57 - Bongo: A massive capybara
30 Jan 18:58 - Bongo: <Media omitted>
30 Jan 18:59 - Bongo: They're pretty much punching bags
30 Jan 18:59 - Bongo: They weigh a tonne and I bet they're so chilled they'd just let you punch them until they die
30 Jan 19:04 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: Yeah I'm at pub, leaving in 10
30 Jan 19:05 - Tegan: Aiight
30 Jan 19:37 - Dave: I could take an ostrich
30 Jan 19:38 - Martha: There in 30 xxx
30 Jan 19:38 - Dave: Whoop
30 Jan 19:39 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: Roman numeral bants
30 Jan 19:40 - Tegan: Niiice
30 Jan 19:47 - Bongo: I'm bored and ill, anyone want to come entertain me?
30 Jan 19:47 - Bongo: Probably one of the least tempting offers I've ever made but that just shows how extremely ill I am
30 Jan 20:15 - Tegan: Sorry dude - I'm being bored and ill over here
30 Jan 20:16 - Tegan: I would recommend the David Attenborough on the beeb about birds of paradise
30 Jan 20:16 - Tegan: The voice is medicine, and the birds are silly
30 Jan 20:29 - Tegan: Mike
30 Jan 20:29 - Tegan: Bring more wine
30 Jan 20:30 - Tegan: And Yorkshire puddings
30 Jan 20:30 - Tegan: Loads of Yorkshire puddings
30 Jan 20:30 - Dave: Plz
30 Jan 20:39 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: Yorkshire puddings?
30 Jan 20:39 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: Also Dave, are you nuts, an ostrich would kick your face off
30 Jan 20:40 - Dave: Yup x many
30 Jan 20:40 - Dave: Nah mate, I'd dodge it's kick and punch it in the beak
30 Jan 20:40 - Dave: BAM!
30 Jan 20:40 - Joe Jarman: Bongo
30 Jan 20:40 - Joe Jarman: Come here
30 Jan 20:40 - Joe Jarman: And we will look after you
30 Jan 20:40 - Joe Jarman: Ill send an uber
30 Jan 20:41 - Joe Jarman: Got some free credits
30 Jan 20:41 - Dave: Or maybe wrestle it
30 Jan 20:41 - Owen: Dave you can't dodge a balcony how are you gonna dodge an ostrich!?

6 Feb 18:21 - Bongo: On the bus, be there in 5 hours
6 Feb 18:21 - Bongo: Because that's how bloody long it takes to get anywhere on a bus in London
6 Feb 18:22 - Sam Roberts: Bus? You mean the peasant wagon
6 Feb 18:22 - Bongo: Amen
6 Feb 18:23 - Bongo: I bet none of these herberts have even ever tried gold-flecked champagne with their cereal before

7 Feb 08:23 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: Ow my brain üòñ
7 Feb 09:06 - Bongo: Lol I literally saw you passed out on the couch, did you wake up to text that?
7 Feb 09:14 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: Passed out from the overexertion of texting that
7 Feb 09:54 - Bongo: Children of the third world have to walk for 2 hours each day to get fresh water
7 Feb 09:54 - Bongo: But that's nothing compared to the harsh climates that some people live in the uk
7 Feb 09:55 - Bongo: Donate ¬£2 a month to provide mike with a monkey butler so that he doesn't have to waste energy texting
7 Feb 09:56 - Tegan: Can I have a monkey butler for ¬£2 a month?
7 Feb 09:56 - Tegan: I'm not after charity, I'll fund my own
7 Feb 10:02 - Bongo: Hmm yea I want one too
7 Feb 10:03 - Bongo: Screw mike, I'm getting a fleet of monkey butlers
7 Feb 10:03 - Bongo: Fleet is the collective noun for monkey butlers right?

7 Feb 18:17 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: Big hero 6 was class!

7 Feb 21:40 - Sam Roberts: Looks like a dnd wet dream
7 Feb 21:49 - Pete Morey: Basically
10 Feb 14:13 - Bongo: That Strauss Khan sex party story is hilarious
10 Feb 14:13 - Bongo: "Okay I pimped girls at sex parties, but that was only like 12 times"
10 Feb 14:14 - Bongo: And someone else who regularly attended is all like "I was there for professional reasons" lol
10 Feb 15:57 - Owen: Give the guy a break he only had 12 sex parties over the course of 3 years. Thats a 3 month wait between sex parties. I have to wait less time between holidays!
10 Feb 15:58 - Owen: Also he, and I quote: "did it for fun." We can all sympathise with that nobel aim.
10 Feb 16:00 - Tegan: Classy
10 Feb 16:00 - Tegan: He was going to be the head of the IMF a few years ago
10 Feb 16:00 - Tegan: The IMF could use more sex patios
10 Feb 16:00 - Tegan: Parties dammit
10 Feb 16:03 - Owen: They face charges of "aggravated pimping." I know aggravated probably has a legal definition but i cannot stop picturing him as some kind of super pimp with mega chains and a massive furry hat.
10 Feb 16:04 - Owen: Sex patios also sound good teegs
10 Feb 16:11 - Hannah Murphy: Bongo give him some slack - it was 12 parties across three years, so only four a year
10 Feb 16:12 - Owen: Repost!!!
10 Feb 16:40 - Tegan: Who doesn't throw quarterly sex parties?
10 Feb 16:41 - Owen: They sink up with tax day
10 Feb 16:46 - Vanessa: Here's my rant, I can't believe after so many years with the 100ml rule at airport security you STILL get people completely dumbfounded when their shampoo gets taken away
10 Feb 16:47 - Owen: But I am special so surely the rules don't apply to me.
10 Feb 16:48 - Vanessa: Yes, I forgot, it's in the small print
10 Feb 17:08 - Shaggy: Oh I thought it's 100ml only for explosive liquids
10 Feb 17:27 - Tegan: Yup. Only solid explosives in larger quantities.
10 Feb 17:27 - Tegan: Or in they have to be in your checked luggage
10 Feb 18:33 - Bongo: And definitely no alan keys right Sam?
10 Feb 18:33 - Bongo: You terrorist
10 Feb 18:39 - Bongo: 1) who brings an alan key with them on holiday
10 Feb 18:40 - Bongo: 2) why does it get banned from taken on the flight
10 Feb 18:57 - Shaggy: I had bike tools taken away from me as well
10 Feb 20:29 - Sam Roberts: Fascists with their ridiculous rules on bike gear
10 Feb 20:30 - Sam Roberts: Must be to limit bike thefts in India
12 Feb 13:09 - Tegan: <Media omitted>

12 Feb 13:25 - Tegan: All Sri Lanka lacks is a big group of lads

12 Feb 13:43 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: Hitting the big Jesus this eve I think
12 Feb 13:44 - Tegan: Don't hit him
12 Feb 13:44 - Tegan: He had enough stick when he was alive
12 Feb 13:45 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: Yeah and you wouldn't like big Jesus when he's angry
12 Feb 13:46 - Tegan: Damn right
12 Feb 13:46 - Tegan: He is of second coming prop proportions
12 Feb 15:35 - Owen: I live!
12 Feb 15:53 - Owen: I thought I had killed my phone by rooting it. But i hadn't
12 Feb 15:59 - Tegan: Owen!
12 Feb 16:15 - Sam Roberts: Can it do awesome stuff now it's rooted?
12 Feb 16:17 - Owen: I can delete apps that were locked by the OS

12 Feb 16:18 - Sam Roberts: Ah fuck, how easy was it?

12 Feb 18:05 - Henry Dranks: congratulations joeee!
12 Feb 18:05 - Henry Dranks: Did it work owen?
12 Feb 18:33 - Owen: Nah it was too much effort keeping track of everything. It also became a bit distracting because kids would argue for xp.
12 Feb 18:33 - Owen: This looks like it will remove those problems.
12 Feb 19:23 - Bongo: Cool pic, I can forgive it even though it's in paradise
12 Feb 19:23 - Bongo: I might have to lead this group when everyone whips out the carnival pics
12 Feb 19:24 - Owen: Congratulations Joe!!!

12 Feb 20:27 - Joe Jarman: Obviously I didnt
12 Feb 20:32 - Vanessa: I know a couple who actually made up their last name
12 Feb 20:33 - Vanessa: I thought that was pretty original
12 Feb 20:34 - Shaggy: Did they randomly put their names together with a hyphen in between?
12 Feb 20:34 - Vanessa: Nope they actually made a new name using their old names as guidance
12 Feb 20:34 - Vanessa: Gordan and Leech to make Leedon
12 Feb 20:35 - Vanessa: Her husband's mother was not too pleased
12 Feb 20:35 - Shaggy: Anagram contest!

12 Feb 20:39 - Shaggy: Dong is good too
12 Feb 20:39 - Shaggy: Omg, it can be Horde
12 Feb 20:39 - Shaggy: They missed out
12 Feb 20:40 - Shaggy: If I was her husband's mother I would be unhappy too
12 Feb 20:45 - Vanessa: Why? Because they should have gone with Horde?
12 Feb 21:45 - Owen: Bomes or Jott would be ours
13 Feb 01:51 - Tegan: Obvs you should both have taken Liza's name

17 Feb 13:12 - Tegan: Let us know what you neeeed

17 Feb 14:33 - Adam Wills: Can you do this again next week? I'm waiting for my baggage in an airport, and this chat is making me well hungry!

17 Feb 15:04 - Tegan: Roger on the ricotta etc
17 Feb 15:17 - Adam Wills: Just came back to Bangalore from Kashmir... FYI for all snowboarders - Go to gulmarg in Kashmir for a once in a lifetime snowboarding experience... I would be so up for doing that again (sewing a little seed for next season - Feb is the time to do it)
17 Feb 15:17 - Adam Wills: But seriously can you do pancakes again next week??
17 Feb 15:18 - Shaggy: We can definitely have more pancakes, what kind of question is that?

17 Feb 18:45 - Tegan: How many are coming?

17 Feb 18:46 - Martha: Me + teegs + Lorna + shaggy + bongo = 5+...
17 Feb 18:48 - Shaggy: Vinay. Angie made a noise earlier
17 Feb 18:48 - Angela: I did! Just looking at trains from mine now
17 Feb 18:49 - Angela: Is there free parking near yours? Feeling lazy
17 Feb 18:49 - Angela: And what can I bring?
17 Feb 18:53 - Tegan: My only request is lemons
17 Feb 18:53 - Angela: All my trains to elephant are cancelled! What treachery is this!
17 Feb 18:54 - Shaggy: There is but I suspect not free, I will be home shortly and check
17 Feb 18:56 - Angela: Cool thanks, trains are all cancelled til 7.40 and then it says bulletin on the service, whatever that means
17 Feb 19:03 - Shaggy: Yup you can park downstairs
17 Feb 19:04 - Angela: Woohoo! I'll be there in about 30 then, with lemons!
17 Feb 19:11 - Tegan: If anyone is with Dave, could you tell him I plan to leave his key in the gas lockers? Or find out if he had the spares?

17 Feb 19:22 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: Dave has the spares

17 Feb 19:29 - Lorna: Passed him. I'm outside
17 Feb 23:04 - Tegan: Sooooo pancaked

18 Feb 10:37 - Shaggy: Matt Berry: Wildlove
18 Feb 11:45 - Tegan: Research confirms there is no such thing as a carpet pigeon. .. so what was that funky bird?
18 Feb 11:59 - Hannah Murphy: WHAT THE FUCK WAS THAT
18 Feb 18:42 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: Man its really weird to feel cold again
18 Feb 18:42 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: Kind of comforting
18 Feb 18:54 - Sam Roberts: It's nice being back in England in all its drizzly glory
18 Feb 18:56 - Sam Roberts: Well jealous of the pancake chat
18 Feb 19:35 - Bongo: We'll probs have another one next week
18 Feb 19:36 - Bongo: It's a little known fact that there was a second, more popular Saint of pancakes who's favourite topping was beer
18 Feb 19:36 - Bongo: His day is next week
18 Feb 19:39 - Sam Roberts: Ah, the festival of St Beercakes, how could I forget?
18 Feb 19:42 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: He drove all the teetotallers out of Ireland
18 Feb 22:26 - Tegan: Yo, Dave's heading over in the AM to collect his bizniz from C town- he should be there for 8.30
18 Feb 22:27 - Tegan: Can someone let him in?
18 Feb 22:39 - Sam Roberts: Lemme check with Ferenc, else might have to be a smidge earlier

18 Feb 22:45 - Sam Roberts: His number's just coming, if he doesn't answer just give him a call
18 Feb 22:46 - Sam Roberts: One of us will probably be around anyway, swearing about having to leave the house
18 Feb 22:46 - Sam Roberts: Ferenc Fernando.vcf (file attached)
19 Feb 07:31 - Tegan: Dave's phone is bezonked, so he won't be able to phone anyone
19 Feb 07:33 - Tegan: But he is on his way eta 8.25

20 Feb 00:01 - Bongo: "Sometimes people write novels and they just be so wordy and self-absorbed. I am not a fan of books. I would never want a book's autograph. I am a proud non-reader of books" - actual quote of Kanye west
20 Feb 07:56 - Tegan: Books can be wordy

20 Feb 18:42 - Lorna: Not sensing much enthusiasm for drinking tonight...
20 Feb 18:43 - Tegan: Everyone else is lame
20 Feb 18:43 - Tegan: Come boogying!
20 Feb 18:46 - Lorna: Where're you going to be? And when?
20 Feb 18:47 - Tegan: Do you fancy dinner at ours?  I'm around kx now having a beer but we probably don't want to go out til later

20 Feb 23:08 - Dave: What time?

20 Feb 23:11 - Owen: So we will be in London from 10/11ish
20 Feb 23:13 - Dave: In the morning I assume
20 Feb 23:13 - Owen: Yeah
20 Feb 23:13 - Owen: 6:30am
20 Feb 23:13 - Owen: But if we stay home we will just sleep and that will fuck me up for work
20 Feb 23:14 - Krizia: Ahhhhh mexxiiico!  ‚ù§üòçüòçüòç
20 Feb 23:14 - Dave: K - my parents may be down but if not then maybe
20 Feb 23:14 - Krizia: It's it amazing or wwhhhaaaaattttt? ??
20 Feb 23:15 - Krizia: Say Hi to Phil!
20 Feb 23:15 - Krizia: Pretty though to stay awake!!
20 Feb 23:18 - Owen: Phil says hi too
20 Feb 23:19 - Owen: Chinese new year in London is one of the simultaneously best and worst things ever
20 Feb 23:19 - Owen: Its like watching a movie that's so bad it's good.
20 Feb 23:45 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: Hey that new breaking bad show has started!
20 Feb 23:45 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: Better call Saul... Has anyone watched it?
21 Feb 00:00 - Bongo: Yep
21 Feb 00:00 - Bongo: Pretty good
21 Feb 00:01 - Bongo: Not nearly as good as breaking bad
21 Feb 10:12 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: Yeah it's not bad so far
21 Feb 10:13 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: Less funny madcaps than I was expecting
21 Feb 11:21 - Pete Morey: I like it,  s'good...  Basically pre-bb Saul is pre cancer Walt
21 Feb 11:21 - Pete Morey: Same premise + arc,  but it's a good one so worth repeating
21 Feb 11:23 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: I dunno, slip and fall Saul?
21 Feb 11:24 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: He's pretty devious from the start
21 Feb 12:02 - Pete Morey: Yeah true
21 Feb 12:03 - Pete Morey: Slippin Jimmy
21 Feb 12:04 - Pete Morey: I'm shutting up about it now, in case spoilers etc
21 Feb 12:06 - Pete Morey: Random pc question for anyone who might be able to help:
21 Feb 12:09 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: Turn it off and on again
21 Feb 12:11 - Pete Morey: I just bought pc and ssd - I wanna put the os on the ssd but it has come pre loaded on the hdd. No installation disk and any legit online source for installation is an 'update' rather than original install.  Anywhere I can get a windows 8 installation?  Any other suggestions about how to proceed??
21 Feb 12:11 - Pete Morey: Sorry:I tried bashing with a rock already
21 Feb 12:17 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: Are you sure you want windows 8?
21 Feb 12:17 - Mike Swarbrick Jones: I've heard it's weird
21 Feb 12:18 - Pete Morey: Yeah it's weird... Too late now I got it
21 Feb 12:19 - Pete Morey: It tries to turn windows into an app system or smt
21 Feb 12:20 - Pete Morey: It's my cheapest option cos I got a product key with the pc
21 Feb 12:22 - Sam Roberts: We've got a Windows 7 bit usb with a crack somewhere, can use that
21 Feb 12:23 - Sam Roberts: If you're on 8, get the 8.1 update and you can run a proper desktop. All the panel stuff is weak unless you're using it as a touch screen
21 Feb 12:23 - Pete Morey: Yeah?
21 Feb 12:23 - Pete Morey: Or maybe I could transfer 7 from my old laptop
21 Feb 12:23 - Pete Morey: I'm checking that out now
21 Feb 12:24 - Pete Morey: How do I get the 7 windows of ye Sam?
21 Feb 12:28 - Pete Morey: Oh yeah I have 8.1 sorry yeah
21 Feb 12:32 - Sam Roberts: I've got to do mine sometime, Windows party Monday night?
21 Feb 12:34 - Pete Morey: Haha sounds fun.  I might have a solution from my housemate by then,  but YES in principle.  How does a windows party work then?
21 Feb 12:38 - Sam Roberts: You come round about 8, we celebrate everything Windows
21 Feb 12:38 - Sam Roberts: Looking out of them, opening, closing, the LOT
21 Feb 12:39 - Pete Morey: .. Maybe we could put our pc s together in a room/pit and encourage them to kiss
21 Feb 12:39 - Pete Morey: ... And/or fight...
21 Feb 12:40 - Pete Morey: We could take bets
21 Feb 12:40 - Pete Morey: On outcomes etc
21 Feb 12:41 - Pete Morey: Godammit this isn't helping with my OS/Ssd problem at all...
21 Feb 12:43 - Pete Morey: (it takes me two hours to get to canning town btw.  We'd best have the windows party at a decent mid point.  Or mine.)
21 Feb 12:47 - Sam Roberts: <Media omitted>
21 Feb 12:48 - Pete Morey: <Media omitted>
21 Feb 12:49 - Bongo: For some reason I read that as visual communication helps thinking
21 Feb 12:49 - Pete Morey: It does!
21 Feb 12:51 - Pete Morey: .. But maybe not when trying to plan a windows party w sam
21 Feb 12:51 - Pete Morey: Especially in negotiating a venue that isn't Sam's place...
21 Feb 12:57 - Bongo: Yea that sucks just go with 7
21 Feb 13:29 - Shaggy: Sam I think mentioned about some utility that moves windows over? Did you try it last time you messed with your PC? Clean install would be best anyways, your PC probably comes with a bunch of preinstalled bullshit anyway. How big is the ssd?
21 Feb 13:42 - Pete Morey: Oh hey.  Yeah ideally I want clean install but my pc didn't come with install disk
21 Feb 13:43 - Pete Morey: So I got the product key from the pc and am looking for a standard install iso online
21 Feb 13:43 - Pete Morey: Actually,  I would prefer a USB install
21 Feb 13:44 - Pete Morey: Cos I don't have did drive
21 Feb 13:44 - Shaggy: You need to pirate that shit, you won't find one to download
21 Feb 13:44 - Pete Morey: The ssd is 120gigs
21 Feb 13:44 - Shaggy: Ok that's enough for windows
21 Feb 13:44 - Pete Morey: *DVD
21 Feb 13:45 - Pete Morey: Yeah I thought so.  Windows plus Adobe and office programs I hope
21 Feb 13:46 - Pete Morey: Can I not just use a standard install cd as long as I have the product key?
21 Feb 13:46 - Pete Morey: (which is downloadable)
21 Feb 13:47 - Pete Morey: (or I thought it would be)
21 Feb 13:47 - Shaggy: It's not
21 Feb 13:47 - Pete Morey: Wow that's shit
21 Feb 13:47 - Shaggy: Yup
21 Feb 13:48 - Pete Morey: Can I not just use someone else's install cd then?  No crack needed cos I have legit cd key
21 Feb 13:52 - Shaggy: Don't have windows 8, 'm afraid
21 Feb 13:54 - Pete Morey: 8.1?
21 Feb 13:54 - Shaggy: Same thing
