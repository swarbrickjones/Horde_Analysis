online source for installation is an 'update' rather than original install anywhere i can get a windows installation any other suggestions about how to proceed sorry i tried bashing with a rock already.yeah it's weird too late now i got it it tries to turn windows into an app system or smt it's my cheapest option cos i got a product key with the pc.yeah or maybe i could transfer from my old laptop i'm checking that out now how do i get the windows of ye sam oh yeah i have sorry yeah.haha sounds fun i might have a solution from my housemate by then but yes in principle how does a windows party work then.maybe we could put our pc s together in a room pit and encourage them to kiss and or fight we could take bets on outcomes etc godammit this isn't helping with my os ssd problem at all it takes me two hours to get to canning town btw we'd best have the windows party at a decent mid point or mine..it does but maybe not when trying to plan a windows party w sam especially in negotiating a venue that isn't sam's place.oh hey yeah ideally i want clean install but my pc didn't come with install disk so i got the product key from the pc and am looking for a standard install iso online actually i would prefer a usb install cos i don't have did drive.the ssd is gigs.dvd yeah i thought so windows plus adobe and office programs i hope can i not just use a standard install cd as long as i have the product key which is downloadable or i thought it would be.wow that's shit.can i not just use someone else's install cd then no crack needed cos i have legit cd key..bum bum what about transfer from hdd to ssd i'll go away do some research now.nerdgasm.oh ok i could join that if i wasn't immediately 'noobed' or smt 'hazed' 'bummed'.cool conversation moved on another note joe
