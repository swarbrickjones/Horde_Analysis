analytically continue the riemann zeta function and evaluate at that's what you get kinda cheating though as written the series is clearly divergent.this is quite complicated zeta x is well defined for real x for x the series is not convergent there's a thing called analytic continuation where roughly you find a function which agrees with your function where it is defined and is analytic read infinitely differentiable on a compact subset of the complex numbers but the analytic continuation is not the same as the original function so it doesn't make sense to use the series definition of zeta for x and say zeta.we should start a nerd horde group or something.your mum is a divergent series bunn mathbants.alright alright i just made a new group for nerdy stuff tech support etc added
