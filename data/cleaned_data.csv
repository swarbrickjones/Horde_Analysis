"26 Mar 18:40 2015","Henry:. . The Bible clearly states that the sky is a solid dome, a firmament, which was firm enough to separate waters above it from those below on the Earth. By Noah's time it was still solid enough to have windows in it that had to be opened to let the rain through. I think that false-Christians that spite on God's face by calling it poetic metaphor have given in to the godless materialists! The Bible really is literal, in the true sense of the word. The sky was a hard firmament with windows in it-and anybody who says different is a mealy-mouthed evolution-sympathizer. . . Almost certainly a  parody.. Also:. . Evolutionists want to call those piddlin' changes evolution--which just shows that they don't even know what the term means. So we creationists have to tell them that evolution means apes popping out human babies. You'd think them evil-utionists'd have that straight by now.","Owen",""

Finally i agree w tegan and mike that as the answer given was actually not valid that should be pointed out to the kid. Whether kid wants to be a smartass or not he should make sure his answer is valid.. I have been humbled a few times by little kids outsmarting me. For example one time kids were really noisy and i yelled and asked if they could hear me. A little 4 year old said to me:. Of course i can hear you. I have ears.. So i never asked things in that way again.. Another time i told kids off for telling each other off. I said 'I'M the police'. And a 6 or 7 year old said 'no, the POLICE is the police.' So i had to rephrase things differently. Btw the example before came from an Indian friend. (The one in the photo)","Jimena",""

"09 Nov 22:57 2015","Hi all. Would anyone be up for doing some kind of national park trip over the bank holiday weekend at the beginning of May? I'm thinking leave on the Saturday morning, come back on the Tuesday afternoon.  The monday is a bank holiday so just need to take 1 optional day off on the tuesday, and that gives us 3 nights somewhere.  I was thinking Lake District, but anywhere else apart from Snowdonia or Peak District will work (I did both of those in previous years with some non horde people who might be coming on this trip).  If we get a group of 15ish people, i've found a place that will work out at £45 each for 3 nights in the lake district.  It's a bunkhouse - basic, but self-catered, so will be super cheap.  It's also next door to the village pub.  The only other cost is car rental / petrol, which should be £60/£70ish each for the weekend.  If we decide against Lake District, i'm sure we can find a similar place somewhere else.  So, that's the general plan so far.  Let me know if you're interested","Alan",""
