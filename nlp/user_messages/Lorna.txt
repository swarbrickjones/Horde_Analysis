having just voted.i'll take that..i can help drown sorrows if you're still there.i'll see you at the george..i agree with your point about money and elections but with papers i'm not so sure murdoch has it in for the labour party and he controls the majority of the media of the papers anyway the conservative campaign was strengthened by the argument that labour overspent and would put us back in a recession that has no factual basis but it was what murdoch was reporting and people will be influenced by that.which means that now he's minister for justice they'll be hangings.you don't need to

the lizards.they'll make me their queen..yeah i saw that i'm well up for it it's about £ each now if you buy a team ticket for people or £ if you wait until it opens.actually £.you're only cheating yourself..come for food leave before true detective that's probably my plan too.so you don't need food bringing.is a lovely evening i'm playing tennis so can't join.so which night shall we watch inside out wednesday.weds also better for me.well when we organise it for weds and fail to all get to the same cinema they'll probably be a second attempt at the weekend.is unlikely i can do any day apart from weds also if you buy insurance through comparethemarket com you get cinema tickets tuesday and wednesday and one day of travel insurance in the uk is about £ bit late for this week though.yay for me.looks like there isn't one though we could go for food drinks if people don't fancy true detective.guys i heard of an app that gets you a free kozel pint i'm so good at finding

too.so i take it's a nay for the cinema tonight probably for the best.yeah ok though i've been conditioned into thinking that films occur only on tuesdays and wednesdays and on some sort of offer.working from home is the best.i get loads done at home a lot of it not my work but i get no guilt.and george osbourne owes me that's my theory..its a beautiful day park drinks after work.that is truly smashing.woo mike i mean woo the anchor i'm on my way also..i'm coming tonight what shall we eat then wraps.fajitas then super easy to make.do you have paprika and cumin and chilli powder oil chillies.ex bristol folk andy and jo dwyer are around tomorrow from we'll be getting food drinks near paddington and or trafalgar sq.it could do were you thinking before or after the play jo has a train to catch from paddington at some point not sure when andy is staying at ours.we're in the bear and staff opposite gaby's deli near trafalgar square.yeah is good falafel come here for a pint afterwards i took people there on dave's recommendation.hopefully being outside but no proper plans.why is the default colour yellow on all my emojis these are not human.we need to up our game.having
