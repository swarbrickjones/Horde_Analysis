i take it they make a good living even has a wine cooler a 'fridge' specifically for wine u can adjust the temperature according to the type of wine.here you have a wide choice of recent issues including magazines in russian and watch magazines i think i really need to find a new dentist one with a bench and an old hello magazine would be great..why be ashamed in some circles i know 'knowlege' of that sort is just another accessory people flaunt to raise themselves above others fuck the pretentiousness the important things in life can be understood and discussed in simple words.of course i love words and choosing the best one but they are just the clothes that dress our ideas but thats just me ranting so what does non sequitur mean.ah like the penguins are in the shower and one drops the soap joke and then other penguin looks at him and says what do you think i am a shoe.fu fu really that's a new one for me and i've heard it called a bunch of things chichino punani mushy and the ever so crude 'beefcurtains' among others also how does picking up the soap equal falling over can they not pick things up either cause i cant fathom how a being that cant get up or pick up soap like things survives.no...carrots in switzerland.ok ok just the one.its the stories of the lives and mostly deaths of the members of different clans in a medieval type fantasy world as they prepare for winter to come where winter lasts for years and years and brings with it deadly monsters and their ever growing army of undead and there's dragons but they are kids and everyone is also waiting for them to grow and multiply.lol.as someone who hasn't seen sam in years the selfies made me think he wasn't aging so well.hahahaa..and does sex with oneself count if so at which point does it count as sex what are the requirements in fact what are the running sex criteria a teacher must anticipate such questions.frankenplughole..is sam wearing a onesie in that picture or a robe and by robe i really mean dress.lol i didnt know onesies were back although i know they are very popular in australia good friend of mine went through a onesie modelling phase.maybe they are in a different material http www onesiestore com au shop animal onesies.are you ladies not familiar with 'fat pants' i e stretchy loose clothes you can comfortably binge in two a onesie is much like a blankie that hugs all your body at once..i personally think that any valid answer should be accepted as its the person writing the exams job to word thinks clearly teacher might also want to give a lesson on deducing what kind of answer is expected given a context finally i agree w tegan and mike that as the answer given was actually not valid that should be pointed out to the kid whether kid wants to be a smartass or not he should make sure his answer is valid i have been humbled a few times by little kids outsmarting me for example one time kids were really noisy and i yelled and asked if they could hear me a little year old said to me of course i can hear you i have ears so i never asked things in that way again another time i told kids off for telling each other off i said 'i'm the police' and a or year old said 'no the police is the police ' so i had to rephrase things differently btw the example before came from an indian friend the one in the photo.lol she was but touch√©.free dog passes sound pretty sweet to me.chf and they are not even allowed on the seats.pff typical next thing u know they'll be increasing the bus pass fare for non eu pets just to cover the

alien for martyn.kudos to u for asking if we are all seeing the same thing that was a real philosophic move..btw that emoji is meant to be a black thumbs up.but maybe ur phone is reading it as a a penis and an alien.and this one is an ice cream..so im making a sort of app with a wheel of fortune type thing the idea is it should be something u could have up on a screen in a pub customer pays say quid and gets to have a spin my question is what should the different wheel outcomes be i was thinking for example 'headshot you get the nastiest shot in the bar' 'showtime bartenders perform some silly dance song' any ideas i feel quite uninspired.really cuz the nastiest shot i ever had was an abortion vodka and tabasco shall i get u a couple.thank you all for your fantastic suggestions i had a good laugh reading them the website app is mot a commercial project just a project to add to a little portfolio immaking to apply for jobs in web development i figured that my combo of degrees in philosophy and education plus my teaching experience wouldnt do the trick despite some very eloquent motivation letters.web in javascript.oooh yes please im pretty new to the whole shebang wrote my
