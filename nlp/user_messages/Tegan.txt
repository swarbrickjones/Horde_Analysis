Sup most of y'all- any plans for eating tonight? Should I rustle up something general?.Fraid not- Dave's ma is taking us to see some piano guy. God I'm cultured. Catch you afters to move all our clothes from your lounge though.Not sure. That's what makes me so cultured. I could have signed up to anything..Whose a-hippin and a-hoppin tonight? Plans gor meets and eats?.Good is good.. I would imagine our pre-gig and your post-pint drinks will not converge. Probably should have used the other thingy. Doh..I think, on reflection, that we shouldn't have gone for more beer.I think you've summed it up there.Blark.Penitence. That is all..Hope you didnt book us tickets- we can't make it due to a prior engagement. Please give our love to Cate..Sounds lush. Enjoy chica x.You know what would save Christmas? Muppet's Christmas Carol. Tonight. 9pm. Prince Charles cinema..But it will be small. I want big.. And shame on you,  Bunn! Thought I could count on you to make it out of C town!. Though it's not raining here..Fair enough y'all- merry house xmas all round :).Merry Christmas! Yaaaay!.Would be great to come round for Christmas themed fun afters. Also, I need to have a shower. Yay?.Sounds festive. I have your hoodie, it's winging it's way back to you.Yes.  With bells on..Awesome. Awesome to the max.Do you still have enough tickets, Dave?.And tom?.Ah, ok,  I thought he could.  Sorted.  X.I'm about to leave work- head for Leicester Square? Any plausible pub recommendations round there?.Which ones'at then?.Dave suggested the porcupine.  The weather is gross so all pubs will be rammed. I just arrived.  Will go a-sploring..I had to explore some dumplings. So hungry!.Merry Christmas motherfuckers! Eheheheheh! (That is the noise of a girl doing a machine gun noise). Xx.It's beautiful, Phil.  Merry Christmas, Everingham! Xx.All good this end-woke up drunk today and went to monkey world. Who could ask for more? Catch y'all next week x.If anyone is looking for something to stare at tonight, Sightseers is on Film 4- brilliant.Merry Owen, Owen!.Ha!.Hmmmmmmm, it had less laughs than I remembered....Dark, Mike. Dark..Is Shaggy at all enlightened?.Might bugger up the trains. Sorry, bug up the trs.Point taken- it's not really the weather for a walk.  Let's visit the sea in the spring time..Awww, Marth, you're such a poet! I'm easy either way x.Do you guys really not fancy it?.Better suggestions please- on the facebook page If possible,  to keep Chris in the loop.Where are you Cate? I haven't eaten yet either, so we could grab something around there..Waah. But also, ossum..Be there in a jiffy, petal.Ha!.Home safe, Lize?.All seemed ok this afternoon, O. So it's back to watching TV as usual :).Yay! Happy new year and big love to you all.  X.Does anyone find they've got an extra phone charger after the festivities? A white Samsung one?.Daaaaw, some time the party gotta end... We'll probably be back tomorrow!.Charger located. Good eyes, Marth x.I'm a-going out into the storm....... the storm is over. Dry January starts on the 5th. .. It's gonna be so wholesome. Or Phil and I might take up crack....Are you surprised because of my obvious alcoholism? Yeah, Dave and I thought we'd give it a bash. The worst we can do is fail and end up in a downward spiral of alcohol dependency.  Which sounds like some fun!.Let's get into exotic juices.  Or world teas.. Or we can revert to teenagedom and hang out in arcades..Phil, if you dress like that all the way through January, I think we might just make it.Anyone up for a drink after work? I want to celebrates my imminent immunity to yellow fever.It's an acute haemorrhagic viral disease, Bunn.  Duhh.. Get well soon, Marth xx.Cba to use ws?.Words. Sorry, was that not clear?.Mmmmmmm.... grilled cheese sandwich....I'm out- poisoned by Wetherspoons last night :( - I was looking forward to that sandwich. ...Hint: in a break from routine, it's the same colour as my left sock.Can we join you for the movie? Might pass on the take away, I'm on a cream cracker diet.Are you talking cinema or home times?.Depends on the Dave,  he's a little under the weather. .. Will report back.Radio silence from Dave. We also need to factor the laundrette into our plans... Yours?.It's going to be harsh... But yes..Beautiful!.His Hobbes is especially awesome. I can't not say this. .. In case anyone was wondering, business class is the bomb! Sorry dry January,  this champagne is free! FREE!.Sorry guys. I reckon if also be the first to go in a horror film situation. So it's only fitting.It's a blip. Not a slide down an icy January slope. Into a pit of beer..Emphatically both.(It was only a small glass of champagne). I get a frickin menu. But its probably the same food.You know me so well! But I have avoided that temptation x. To Nairobi, for business and pleasure :). [MEDIA] . #elephantselfie.Och, it's actually perfect. I'm sitting out having dinner in shorts.. It probably closer to 30 here today,  but still cool in the shade.Yummers.Teeth for pubes.  Otherwise you'd have to develop a whale-like method of eating which would be awkward at dinner parties..Good question Hannah. Touching on deep and important issues..Are they set in, so that pube maintenance would literally be pulling teeth? I sort of imagined then jangling about.That tk maxx sucks. It's all 'business'.Ha.Nah,  it makes more sense if it's everyone.Otherwise theres no rationale for it happening at all.You'd probably develop some kind of defense.Like an armadillo. Is also negative banter.Beautiful.Agreed.Always having hair in your mouth might be one of the worst feeling things.Blerk.Important stuff, man. Tooth pubes.That's how I was picturing it, Mike. Kinda tribal.Recommend you get on that early and get free ones from your gp- private travel clinic jabs are expensive (underlined). No one needs plague.I did - 2 jabs was Â£160. Yeesh..Schweeeeeeet.Whose coming for dinner on Saturday pre- next men?  Etheopian food, yum yum yum.Cool. I have 2 tickets for next men. One might be for Dave, but if not it's free..Ok, 2 spares.  Doh!.That would be just about perfect location wise... I'll check 'im out.Thanks Bunn. I didn't even want an animal. So shut up...... Octopus!.Shags, any more deets about this restaurant near Russell square? I can't find anything appropriate.Yes, I couldn't find it. Ah well, a walk after dinner will prepare us for boogies..Ok lucky people, I have booked for 16 at Kokeb, off Caledonian Rd, at 7.30 on Saturday.  Let's see what happens. ...Good choice.By the by, I couldn't find my sailor's hat when I left c town this morning. Which was a shame as I wanted to wear it. If you come across it,  do let me know..I forged my week on the understanding that I was going to see Leo tomorrow.  I want that one.. Also can't do Wednesday.Looking for a likely burger on the wharf. .. byron gets all the reviews. But is Super expensive.Also dave had some ulterior motive for not going. Other option is GBK, which is not at all original. But is full of food.Plenty of time for votes and debate throughout the afternoon.Earlier showing is best- can people make 6.30 for dinner? Advantage of the wharf is the cheap tuesday which I am keen to take advantage of.I agree. With Lize. Hard to agree with Owen here. That is to say, not eating before a 3 hour movie will make me cross. Meet at 6? I'm going to vote GBK because the veggie selection at byron looks half arsed, but I could be persuaded by the pain of others for Scottish meat.  If it were a thing..Useful stuff, guys..Cool. See you there at 6.15 ish?.Sounds right- catch you soon.Anyone else eating?.I really liked it. I laughed heartily as di Caprio got fucked up and commited fraud. Thumbs up..It's a bromance, no?.Any fun planned this evening?.How would it be if I finished my frustrating work, came over and cooked something even better than a kebab, and then stared at your tv?. Obviously the plan would still work if you really wanted a kebab.Me too. And I'm bored.  Pretty sure I've stopped learning now.. I'm going to head of to prepare noodle soup a la kebab :).We're going to head out and meet Cate when she arrives for a pre dance drink.  Probs not til 8.30-9 though.A delicate decision....I feel bad for failing dry january. But beer helps me to forget..Slam, where did you go?. Are you meeting cate for a drink? We were gonna come with....It's well worth seeing, Shaggy-i laughed a lot, and it didn't seem like 3 hours.Theres a bit where he takes so much of some kind of sedative that he goes straight to cerebral palsy phase- I think you'd relate ;). I was pointing that comment at Shaggy. As I feel was clear from my perfect syntax.Meaningless,  but perfectly formed.  EMOJI[1f451] . In other news, our engine started! Whoop!.I am so brave.I don't need to prove how hard I am. I just feel it, y'know?.I love paying my taxes - really feels like I'm giving something back. #paidbyDfID.Ha.Yay for Ukraine!

Thanks x.You guys have a little mouse. He is very sweet, but should probably live somewhere else.. Or as Owen would say,  EMOJI[1f42d] ..I vote for Bongo's idea. Then Bunn and Dave's.Maybe we should keep it,  and put a waistcoat on it,  and pet it and pet it and pet it?.That was a terrible sorry.  If mice had a bible, that mouse would almost certainly be jesus..Dave doesn't live dairy tales..Does this mean there is no plan?.Jubilee line is running between stratford and waterloo every 5 mins..Where you wanna go?. On the Northern line?. Northern line is good.DLR isn't on strike. I'm not sure they have ticket offices.I know,  right?  Who needs people.. What time are you heading over,  Slam?.Birthday means slack day.See you in an hour or so.What plan is there tonight? When will people be arriving in Dalston?.Shudder. Must I booze again??.That's the spirit.I'm not ready yet :(.Similar I think.Love y'all a lot. Good birthday, Sam. I'm super glad you were born.  X.I can't even begin to fathom what that means!

Road trip?.I took a load of pictures, but it turns out it was really dark in there.  [MEDIA] . This one's kind of good..You are a poet. And possibly also a child molester..I recognise that dark shape. I think we'll bow out tonight, Bunny- my overdraft and wish to drink cocktails in front of an open fire prevent it. Love something for us x.Having a national day dedicated to booze does suggest a certain relationship with alcohol. Like the irish.Yay! New life!.I've given up.  Going home..funny valentines pictures - Google Search - https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=funny+valentines+pictures&oq=funny+valentines&aqs=chrome.3.69i57j5j0l2&client=ms-android-hms-tef-gb&sourceid=chrome-mobile&espv=1&ie=UTF-8#biv=i%7C17%3Bd%7C4uBkG05MQeSIUM%3A. Turns out I can't share things.I mainly wanted to point or how American it is to group trotsky and lenin with the rest of these despots. Instead I failed. Waah.Well I couldn't get a single thing right could I. I feel humbled, but also,  wiser.Glad you had a good one.  After Marth's comment we were quite worried you'd forked out for a date with some bloke in Nigeria.Eek.Hashtag I wish trade associations had half term.So useful!. I might be a bit late. .. What are the timings?.No wanna pay for 8 mins of class- you'll find me in the bar.Yes. Well demonstrated.  EMOJI[1f451] .Fajitas in c town? Beer?  Plan?
